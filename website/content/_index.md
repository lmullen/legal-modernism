<p class="fs-4 lede">Law and legal practice modernized in the nineteenth-century United States. We are studying and visualizing the history of the modernization of American law.</p>

Oral pleadings and oracular judges gave way to published decisions and codified statutes. Local customs and agrarian rhythms were exchanged for nationally uniform creditor remedies in sync with fast-paced merchant finance. Jurists systematized law into hardened categories of public and private, learned and lay, independent white men and dependent, women, children, and ethnic and religious minorities. 

The textual record of legal modernization is vast. Hundreds of volumes of regulations were formulated, copied, and re-formulated by legislatures. Millions of case reports became the authoritative building blocks for the thousands of treatises from which modern American law was constructed. Our projects analyzing legal modernismâ€™s textual history are gathered here. 

To date, we have traced the diffusion of New York procedure codes and creditor remedies across the United States during Reconstruction. We are in process of merging corpora from Harvard Law School's [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) and Gale's [Making of Modern Law: Legal Treatises](https://www.gale.com/c/making-of-modern-law-legal-treatises-1800-1926) datasets, for which we have developed preliminary analysis and visualizations.
