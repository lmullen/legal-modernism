			The same rule has been applied where the marriage of a female complainant intervenes pending her action.' Generally, the abatement of a suit in equity is merely an interruption to the suit, suspending its progress until now parties are brought before the court;' and this view is fully recognized in tie de- cisions of the United States courts.
			Those courts have also held that a bill of reviver is not the commencement of a new suit, but is the mere continuation of the old suit. If any doubt could upon general principles be entertained upon this subject, it is removed by section 31 of the Judiciary Act above mentioned. In this section, Congress manifestly treats the revivor of the suit, by or against the rep- resentative of the deceased, as a matter of right, and as a mere continuation of the original suit, without any distinction as to the citizenship of the representative, whether he belongs to the same State where the cause is depending, or to another State. Hence, in analogy to the principle governing cross bills and injunction bills touching suits previously brought, if a Circuit Court had jurisdiction of a suit as originally brought, it may be prosecuted by bill of revivor, by a representative whose citizenship would not have entitled him to sue in the first instance.'
			The sole questions, upon entertaining a bill of revivor in the national courts, are, the competency of the party to re- vive, and the correctness of the frame of the bill. General ob- jections to the original bill, founded on its not showing a proper case for the interference of a court of equity, should be reserved till after the revivor of the bill.' And it is said that where the new parties to a proceeding in chancery are the legal representatives of an original party, and the proceedings have been revived in their names, by the order of the Circuit Court, on a bill of revivor, the settled practice is to use all the testimony which might have been used if no abatement had occurred. The representatives take the place of those whom they represent, and the suit proceeds in a new form, unaf. sected by the change of name.'
