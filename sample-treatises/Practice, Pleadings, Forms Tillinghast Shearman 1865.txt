PIEFACE THE differences which will be noticed between the first and second volumes of this work seem to make it proper to give a few words of explanation here, in regard to their causes and extent. For the contents of this volume (with the exception of a few chapters which will be specified presently) I am solely responsible. It seemed best, therefore, to execute the work upon such a plan as my own judgment approved, even though it should differ from that of the more learned and experienced gentleman upon whose plan, and with whose co.operation, the first volume was prepared. Accordingly, it will be noticed that the paragraphs are longer, and more connected; that foot notes are more freely used; that the arrangement is more logical; that decisions, supposed to be erro- neous, are criticised, and that there is throughout a free expression of the author's opinions. These changes have saved over two hun- dred pages of space, without diminishing in the least the quantity of useful matter, or making it less easy of reference. One other change-itself an entire novelty in a legal treatise- demands notice. The cases which have been decided in this state: by a single judge only, since the establishment of the new judicial system in 1847, are distinguished by the insertion of "sp. t." (spe- ial term) between the names of the parties and the number of the volume. The idea was suggested by a somewhat similar plan in Abbotts' Digest, which has been found extremely useful and acceptable. In point of fact, most of the practice cases in this state, between 1831 and 1847, were decided by single judges; but it does not seem practicable to distinguish them; and, moreover, as their decisions were not appealable, they are entitled to more weight than the hasty opinions of judges at chambers, who know that their mis- taes, if any, can be corrected on appeal.
The special term cases reported in the last four volumes of Sand. ford, and the first five of Duer, are not distinguished as such, because they were uniformly decided upon consultation, and are regarded as of equal arthority to general term cases. (See Peopfe v. Sturtevant, 8 Duer, 619.),It was only with the utmost reluctance that a large amount of matter was omitted, for which the profession might naturally look in a volume of this kind. But the size of the book, already enor mous, made it utterly impossible to insert everything that might be desirable. It seemed far better that it should be complete, so far as it went, than that it should skim over everything unsatisfac. torily. Accordingly, the special practice applicable only to Par- tition, Foreclosure, Divorce, actions in the nature of Soir Faciaas and Quo Warranto, the determination of claims to Real Property, Confession of Judgment, and the submission of controversies with' out action, is wholly unconsidered; while the subject of pleading is discussed only in its general aspect, and not with reference to the particular claims or defenses which may be set up thereby, The number of Forms, also, is much reduced from what was con- templated, although over three hundred are given. Nothing, how- ever, has been left out which is necessary to a full understanding of the genered practice in civil actions. It will be observed that the list of' subjects omitted contains only matters which partake of the nature of special proceedings.,Having thus freely confessed the omissions of the work, I trust it may not be deemed presumptuous to state what are claimed as its merits.,1. It is believed that these two volumes will be found more full and complete in their statement of the practice in actions generally: so far as their range extends, than any other book published. The arrangement of the various subjects in the present volume has afforded room for a great increase of necessary matter, much bs which cannot be found in any other single book, even in a briefer form.,2. The number of 'trictlypractice cases cited in the two volumes is greater than in any other book of practice ever published in this otate, covering a period which no other attempts to include. It has been the author's aim to cite every decision in this state, whether before or since the Code, bearing upon the subjects treated, except those which are obsolete, or which are merely confirmatory of other and more authoritative decisions. Even of these, all have been cited that it seemed in the least desirable to,9 iv
.mention. A careful and original selection of English cases has also been made, which will be found to add greatly to the value of the work. Want of room made it impossible to quote as freely from the reports of our sister states. The English decisions are, how- .ever, generally found to carry more weight with the courts.,3. There will be found here, and, I think it not presumptuous to say, nowhere else, a full, methodical and definite statement of all the general principles of pleading under the Code of Procedure, as it exists to-day, supported by such a review of the authorities as to remove nearly every doubt that has been raised by the bewildering conflict of the early decisions. ,4. This is the only work in which a systematic effort has been made to lay down uniform rules for actions at law and in equity, and to carry out to the full the acknowledged intention of the Code of Procedure in that respect. Other authors, of more ability and experience than myself. have hesitated to attempt the task, on account of the long conflict of decisions upon the question whether the Code had really united law and equity. But this controversy having been finally set at rest by the wise decisions of the highest court, the field was open for a work which should accept and carry out this doctrine. If I have succeeded in this branch of my labors, it will afford me a satisfaction outweighing my deep sense of their imperfection in many other respects. If I have entirely failed here, the approbation of my readers on all other points would afford me little gratificat70n. For the conviction has grown upon me mere and more, throughout the progress of the work, that' the failure of the profession in general to appreciate and accept the radical change effected by section 69 of the Code is, more than any and all things else, the source of the confusion and uncertainty which have infected our practice for the last sixteen years. It has been my chief ambition, in the preparation of this volume, to put an end forever to all doubts upon this question, and to persuade the bench and the bar to co-operate in building up that single and uniform system of practice which the Code has so long offered to them in vain. It is believed, therefore, that while this work will be found as full upon matters of " common law" practice as Graham, Burrill or Chitty,'it will also be found as full upon "equity" practice as Barbour, Van Santvoord or Daniell, with the enforced exceptions already noted above. The cases cited in this volume include the 17th Abbott's Re- ports (to page 384), the 27th Howard (to page 192), 40th Barbour, 7th Bosworth, 2d Hilton and 25th New York Reports; except in
that part of the work relating to Pleadings, which does not refer to any cases later than the 16th Abbott, 25th Howard and 38th Barbour. Some cases from the 26th New York, and 8th Boswortb, are included in the latter part of the book. So far as I am aware, there is nothing in the latest reports contradictory of the text, except what is noted in the errata.,It is due to Mr. Charles Francis Stone, a gentleman whose re markable accuracy and ability are known to many, to say that the six chapters on Execution, Redemption, and Precept for Costs (chaps. 115 to 119, and 122), are almost exclusively his work. I should be glad to find that the rest of the volume does not suffer by comparison with these chapters. I have also received valuable assistance upon the Table of Cases from Mr. H. J. Heisch.,In addition to the works mentioned in the preface to the sint volume, I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to the admirably written treatises of the la.mented George Van Santvoord, to the faithful research of Mr. Whittaker, but above all, to the invaluable Digest of the Messrs. Abbott, the most comprehensive and scien- tific work of the kind ever published in a common law country. All treatises have been used merely as indexes to the reports, and are not cited as authority, except where none other could be found.,The delay in the appearance of this volume has been caused by circumstances entirely beyond the author's control. I trust that it will be somewhat atoned for by an improved execution of the work, which is now submitted to the kindly judgment of the pro- session for whose use it is designed.,THOS. G. SHEARMAN.

Bill of particulars.,CHAPTER XXXII. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING UNDER THE CODE.,ARTICLE 1. Forms of pleading.,2. Rules of pleading. 3. Uniformity of system. ART. 1.-Forms of Pleading. All the forms of pleading existing prior to the Code were abolished by it, and the forms of pleading in civil actions in courts of record, and the rules by which the ufficiency of such pleading is to be determined, are those prescribed by the Code. (Code, Â§ 140.)
Forms of pleading. Rules of pleading. This section appears, however, to extend only to the forms originating in the common law or in equity. Forms authorized by positive statute are held to be saved by Â§ 471. (People v. Bennett, sp. t., 5 Abb. 384; asf'd, 6 id. 343; People v. Muller, sp. t., 6 Abb. 344, note; see Bankof Genesee v; Patchin Bank, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 314.) Those forms are, however, only retained so far as they are not inconsistent with the Code (Â§ 471), and in so far as they contain fictitious averments, they are plainly inconsistent with it, and are not binding, if even allowable. (Ensign v. Sherman, 14 How. 439; rev'g S. 0., 13 id. 37.),There is no such reservation as to the common law forms of pleading. Those are absolutely done away, and if used at all, are admissible only upon the same footing as any other pleading of the newest design. Their anti- quity gives them no authority under the Code. (See White v. Joy, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 90; Allen v. Smillie, sp. t., 1 Abb. 357; Eno v. Woodworth, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 253; Blanwhcard v. Strait, sp. t., 8 How. 86; Woods v. Anthony, sp. t., 9 How. 78.),The only pleadings under the Code are a complaint, answer and reply, original or supplemental, and a demur- rer to each. Any other pleading is a nullity (see White v. Joy, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 90; Richtmyer v. Hiaskins, 9 How. 481), and so are even these, when used in cases in which they are not authorized by the Code. (lb.),ART. 2.-Rules of Pleading. The rules of pleading in courts of record are those pre- scribed by the Code (Code, Â§ 140), and such as are infer- able from its provisions, including, of course, the rules of sound logic (Fry v. Bennett, 5 Sands. 69; Code Rep. N. S., 249,) and such as reason and good sense show to be manifestly in furtherance of justice, and necessary to elicit the truth. (Ib.) No other rules of pleading are now law in this State. The Code saved the old rules of prac- tice to some extent (Â§ 469), but made no reservation in
RBles of pleading. Uniformity of system. favor of rules of pleading. (Allen v. Smillie, sp. t., 1 Abb. 357; see Mayhew v. Robinson, 10 How. 162.) Decisions prior to the Code, based upon principles similar to those which it establishes, retain of course all their authority, and such we shall cite in this part of our work. But decisions founded on technical rules or forms are wholly obsolete, and should not be cited or regarded. It is said that the rules of pleading applied in chancery to the stating part of a bill, are the best rules left from the old practice as a guide in the new. (Hunt v. Hucl. Riv. Ils. Co., 2 Duer, 488; see Fay v. Grimsteed, 10 Barb. 329.) But mere matters of evidence, which were plead- able in equity, are not now pleadable.,ART. 3.-Uniformity of System. In the early days of the Code, there was much conflict of opinion as to whether the same rules were applicable to both legal and equitable actions. It was part of the general controversy on the question whether law and equity were really interfused by the Code. The main question has happily been settled in accor- dance with the plain intention of the Legislature, by a succession of conclusive decisions, in which it is finally determined that the effect of the Code is to unite, for all purposes whatever, the jurisdictions, principles, and rules of law and equity, into a single system of jurisprudence. (Cole v. Reynolds, 18 N. Y. 74; Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y. 40; N. Y. Ice Co. v. Northwestern Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. Pr. 414; 21 How. 296; Enmery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Phillips v. Gorham, 17 N. Y. 270; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Protection Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. 85; Crary v. Goodman, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 266; Dobson v. Pearce, id. 156; Giles v. Lyon, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 600.) A host of eases to the contrary are overruled by these authoritative decisions. It is unnecessary to cite any except Reubens v. Joel (13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 488); and Yoorhis v. Childs (17 N. Y. 354), of which, being cases in the Court of Appeals,,3
Uniformity of system. Writing, indorsing and folioing. it is proper to observe that the court only concurred in the conclusion of those opinions, and not in the reasoning of the judge who delivered them both. (See V . i. ce Co. v. Nort7lwestern Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296.),It necessarily follows that the system of pleading intro- duced by the Code is absolutely uniform in its application to actions of every description, whether legal or equitable. (Williams v. H(mjes, sp. t., 5 How. 470; Millikin v. Cary, sp. t., id. 272; see People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 iKem.] 433; Cole v. Reiynolds, 18 N. Y. 74.) All decisions to the contrary are to be disregarded.,CHAPTER XXXIII. FORMAL RULES CONCERNING PIEADINGS. ARTICLE 1. Writing, indorsing and folioing.,2. Mode of statement. 3. Separate statement of distinct claims or defenses. 4. Date and subscription. 5. Copies and service. ART. 1.-Writing, Indorsing and Folioing. How to be written.]-Pleadings must be fairly and legibly written or printed (Rule 20, Stuplrene Court), on paper or parchment, in the English language, except as to technical words, and without any abbreviations except such as are commonly in use. (3 R. S., 5thi ed., 467; [2 id. 275.]) Figures may be stated either in words at length. or in Arabic or Roman figures or numerals. (Ib.),Indorsement and folioing.]--Every pleading must be indorsed with the title of the cause (Rule 20, Suprme Court), and if exceeding 200 words in length, must be folioed in the margin, and all copies must correspond with the numbering of the folios in the original. (Id.),A pleading defective in any of these respects must be returned within twenty-four hours after its receipt, with a
.Mode of stateLent. Distinct claims or defenses. particular statement of the objection, or the defect is waived. (Rule 20, Supreme Court; Strauss v. Parker, sp. t., 9 How. 342; Chiathan Bankc v. Van Yegihten, 5 Duer, 628; Sawyer v. Scolonmlaker, sp. t., 8 How. 198.),ART. 2.-Mode of Statement. Commencement.]--A simple and direct mode of opening the statements of a pleading is preferable. In general it would be sufficient and proper to begin a complaint merely with the words " The plaintiff complains." But the complaint sometimes contains in its first allegation matter which is rather favorable to the plaintiff than otherwise, as for instance his appointment as executor, &c., which ho alleges, but of which he does not conplain at all, and for this reason the words " and alleges" are added in the form here given. The answer may commence " The defendant answers to the complaint;" and the reply, "The plaintiff replies to the answer," &c. Separating and nunbering allegations.]-It is highly con- ducive to the logical order and precision of pleadings to separate and number consecutively every allegation. It is desirable to confine each paragraph of the pleadings to a single issuable averment. This plan has been adopted in England with regard to pleadings in equity, and affi- davits in all the courts, and has given universal satisfac- tion. It is found to be, as we have always believed it would prove, the best guarantee against repetition and superfluity that has ever been devised. AET. 3.-Separate statement of Distinct Claims or Defenses. Each cause of .action (Code, Â§ 167), defense, or counter- claim (id., Â§ 150), whether in a complaint, answer, or reply (Rale 19, Supremot Court), must be separately stated, and plainly numbered (Rule 19), unless such a course would involve excessive and useless prolixity, in which case a,5
Distinct claims or defenses. Remedy against error. number of claims, all substantially alike, may be thrown into one. (Longworthy v. Knapp, sp. t., 4 Abb. 115.) Thus, in an action to recover a penalty of $3 for an offense committed on over 1,000 different days, the plaintiff was allowed to state all the facts in one claim. (Ib.),The word count is inapplicable to pleadings under the Code, which rejects fictions, and therefore cannot admit different modes of stating the same cause. If there are really different causes of action to be stated, they should be called, as they are, different causes of action, or, more shortly, different claims.,Remedy against Error.]-An omission to state distinct claims or defenses separately, is not a ground for de- murrer. (Dorman v. Kellam, 4 Abb. 202; 14 How. 184; Badger v. Benedict, sp. t., 4 Abb. 176; 1 Hilt. 414; Har- sen v. Bayaud, 5 Duer, 656; Woodbury v. Sackrider, 2 Abb. 402; Peckclam v. Smith, sp. t., 9 How. 436; loKb- inson v. Judd, sp. t., 9 How. 378; Gooding v. M'Alister, sp. t., 9 How. 123; see iattin v. M'Carty, 8 Abb. 232; 17 How. 239; Forsyth v. Edmiston, sp. t., 11 How. 408; How. 184.*,The remedy is by motion, either to set aside the pleading as irregular (ib.) or to strike out all that does not pertain to a single claim or defense as irrelevant or redundant. (See Dorman v. Kellam, supra; Benedict v. Seymour, sp. t., 6 How. 298.),The only remedy against an omission to number sepa- rate claims or defenses is to return the pleading forthwith, with a statement of the objection. (Corbin v. George, sp. t., 2 Abb. 465.),* Overruling Colwell v. N. Y & Erie R. R. (sp. t., 9 How. 314); Van Namee v. Peoble (sp. t., 9 How. 198); Strauss v. Parker (sp. t., 9 How. 342); Getty v. Hud. River R. R. (sp. t., 8 How. 177); Durkee v. Saratoga R. R. (sp. t., 4 How. 226); see Pike v. Van Wormer (sp. t., 5 How. 171); Acom v. American Mineral Co. (sp. t., 11 How. 27).
Date and subscription. Copies and service.,ART. 4.-Date and Subscription. Date.l--Pleadings need not, in strictness, be dated. (3fiiay urd v. Talcott, 11 Barb. 569.) But for convenience to all parties, it is well that they should be.,Stcbscriptionl.]-Every pleading must be subscribed by the party or his attorney. (Code, Â§ 156.) Such subscrip- tion may be either written or printed (Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Ross, sp. t., 10 Abb. 260, n.; overruling Farmers' Loan, &c., Co. v. Dickson, sp. t., 9 id. 61; 17 How. 477), and is sufficiently made by subscribing to the verification of the pleading, if any (Hubbell v. Livingston, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 63; see Purdy v. Upton, sp. t., 10 How. 494; Post v. Coleman, sp. t., 9 id. 64), though this is not good practice. The omission of the subscription does not make the pleading a nullity (EMle v. Huller, 10 Abb. 287; 6 Bosw. 661), and the proper course in case of such omission is to return the pleading, with a statement of the defect. (See ib.),ART. 5.-Copies and Service. Copies.--It is important that the copies of pleadings served should be correct, for the copies served are regarded as of more importance than the originals. The party upon whom a copy is served is entitled, for all purposes, to regard that as the pleading. (Trowbridge v. Didier, 4 Duer, 448.) The issues raised by the copies served are the only issues to be tried (ib.), and defects in such copies are not cured by showing that the originals are correct. (Hughes v. Wood, 5 Duer, 603; Graham v. M'Coun, sp. t., 5 Hlow. 353; Littlejohn v. Munn, 3 Paige, 280.) Service.]-The rules concerning the service of pleadings are the same as in the case of other ordinary papers in the cause. (See, ante, i. 361.),a 7
Facts only to be pleaded. Facts to be stated as they exist,CHAPTER XXXIV. WHIAT SHOULD BE PLEADED. ARTICLE 1. Facts only to be pleaded.,2. All essential facts to be pleaded. 3. No other facts to be pleaded. 4. Matters presumed, implied, or judicially noticed, need,not be pleaded. ART. 1.-Facts only to be pleaded. Pleadings (other than de/urrers) must state facts (Code, Â§ 142), and are not authorized to state anything but facts.,Pleadings must be true.]-It was a professed rule of the common law, that all pleadings must be true. (Slade v. Drake, Hobart, 295.) But this salutary rule was so over- laid with technical exceptions and artificial interpretations as to make it practically a nullity. The Code has restored it, under the new system, to its proper position of absolute supremacy. All pleadings ought now to be literally and absolutely true. (See People v. M'Cumber, 18 N.

Wi1itbeck, sp. t., cited 1 Monell Prac. 470.) No legal fictions are to be pleaded in any case, whether derived from the common law or from statutes antecedent to the Code. (Ensignt v. Shlerman, 14 How. 439; see Dias v. Short, 16 How. 322; Jordan and Sken. Plankroad Co. v. Morley, 23 N. Y. 552; Farron v. Sherwood, 17 N. Y. 227; Dows v. Hotchckiss, sp. t., 10 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 285.),Facts to be stated as they exist.] In general, facts are to be stated in pleading as they actually exist, and not according to their legal effect. (Jordan & Skeneatels Plankroad Co. v. Morley, 23 N. Y. 552; Farron v. Sher- wood, 17 N. Y. 227, 230; Smith v. Leland, 2 Duer, 497, 509; Lee v. Ainslie, 4 Abb. 467; 1 Hilt. 277; St 8

Hitchins, 4 How. 98; see Buffalo and N. Y. . R. Co. v. Dudley, 14 N. Y. 343; Cropsey v. Sweeney, 7 Abb. 131; 27 Barb. 312.) The cases in which it was held that facts must be stated according to their legal effect (Hall v. Sout7mayd, sp. t., 15 Barb. 32; Pattison v. Taylor, sp. t., 8 Barb. 250; Code Eep. [N. S.], 175; Dollner v. Gibson, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 153), were erroneously decided on that point, and the case of Dollner v. Gibson was reversed at general term in March, 1852. The facts nmy nevertheless be stated according to their legal effect, provided that when so stated the pleading remains substantially true (Bennett v. Judson, 21 N. Y. 238; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Prot. Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. 85; rev'g S. C., 20 Barb. 468; Stewart v. Travis, sp. t., 10 How. 153; Rogers v. Verona, 1 Bosw. 419; see Oneida Bank .v. Ontario Bans, 21 N. Y. 502; Hoyt v. TWompson, 19 N. Y. 219), but not otherwise. (Gaspler v. Adams, 28 Barb. 441.) The eonsequence of pleading facts according to their legal effect will be to put the pleader at the discretion of the cou;it in regard to the terms upon which evidence will be admitted under such allegations. If there is no misleading variance between the pleading and the proof, no terms will be imposed, but if there is, as there often must be, the pleader in fault may be compelled to amend and pay costs. Wltat are facts.]-It becomes essential to determine what are facts. Facts are to be carefully distinguished rom conclusions of law, arguments and hypotheses. None of these are allowable in pleading. (Boyce v. Brown, 7 Barb. 85.) Facts, within the meaning of the Code, are in general actual occurrences-physical facts, capable of demonstration by evidence without any reference to,2,9
Facts only to be pleaded. Conclusions of law. municipal law, and from which the court can draw the legal conclusions necessary to sustain the pleader's case, (Lawrence v. Wright, 2 Duer, 673; see Prace v. Cockcrot, 4 E. D. Smith, 34; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377.) Thus, if A. borrows money of B., the borrowing is a fact, and the non-payment is a fact, but the consequent inferences that B. owes A. the money, and that A. is entitled to have it, are conclusions of law, and not actual facts. (See Drake v. Cockcroft, 4 E. D. Smith, 34; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377.),CoUnlusions of law.]-Pacts are plainly distinct from conclusions of law, and legal conclusions or inferences are therefore not to be pleaded, but the facts from which they are drawn must alone be stated. If the former are stated without the latter, the pleading is vitally defective (APKyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297, 303; People v. M'Cum. ber, 15 How. 186; asf'd 18 N. Y. 315; City of Buffalo v. Holloway, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 493; Merritt v. Millard, 5 Bosw. 625; Lienan v. Lincoln, 2 Duer, 670; Sclenck v. Naylor. 2 Duer, 675; Casey v. Mann, sp. t., 5 Abb. 91; S. a., 14 How. 163; Van Schaick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 89), while if the facts are properly stated, the legal inferences derivable therefrom are wholly superfluous in a pleading. (Niblo v. Harrison, sp. t., 7 Abb. 452; Lawrence v. Wright, 2 Duer, 673; Seymour v. Maddox, 16 Q. B. 330; see Jones v. Plwniix Bank, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 235; Connecticut Banik v. SmitL, sp. t., 9 Abb. 168; Haight v. Child, 34 Barb. 186; Durant v. Gardner, sp. t., 10 Abb. 447.),Thus, a bare allegation of " adverse possession " is bad, as a mere conclusion of law. (Clarke v. Hughes, 13 Barb. 147; see Bowie v. Brahe, 3 Duer, 35, 44; Munro v. Mer- C7hwt, 26 Barb. 383.) And so is an allegation that a party was bound to repair (Casey v. Mann, sp. t., 5 Abb. 91; S. C., 14 How. 163), or bound to know (see Berley v. -Newton, 10 How. 490), or that no cause of action has accrued (People v. Ml'Ctuiber, 15 How. 186; 27 Barb. 632; asf'd, 18 N. Y. 315), except when pleading the 10
Faets only to be pleaded. Conclusions of law. statute of limitations. (Bell v. Yates, 33 Barb. 627.) So, except in pleading under Â§ 162 of the Code (Keteltas v. Myers, 19 N. Y. 231; rev'g S. 0., 3 E. D. Smith, 83; prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425), an averment that a certain sum is or is not due, amounts to nothing (M'Eyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 303; Webb v. Goldsmith, 2 Duer, 418; Niblo v. Harrison, sp. t., 7 Abb. 452) and, except in pleading the judgment or decision of a court or judge (Code, 161), or the performance of conditions precedent (Code, Â§ 162; see Ferner v. Willians, 37 Barb. 9; 14 Abb. 215), it would seem that it is useless to allege that an act was duly performed. (Graham v. Machado, 6 Duer, 517; Myers v. Mac7uulo, sp. t., 6 Abb. 198; but see People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433; People v. Walker, 2 Abb. 422; Woodbury v. Sackrider, id. 405; Fowler v. N. Y. Indemnity Ins. Co., 23 Barb. 150.) And in all cases it is a mere legal conclusion, and therefore a nullity in pleading, to allege that it is or was the duty of any person to do or not to do any particular thing (City of Buffalo v. Holloway, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 493; Bartlett v. Crozier [Ct. of Errors], 17 Johns. 456; Taylor v. Atlantic Ins. Co., 2 Bosw. 111; Gott v. Gandy, 2 E. & B. 845;. Seymour v. Maddox, 16 Q. B. 330; Brown v. Mallett, 5 0. B. 615; Lancaster Canal Co. v. Parnaby, 11 Ad. & El. 242; Cane v. Chapman, 5 Ad. & El. 651, 658), or that a party is or is not entitled to a thing (Drake v. Cockeroft, 4 E. D. Smith, 34; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377; Phinney v. Phinney, sp. t., 17 How. 199; Walter v. Lock- wood, 23 Barb. 233; 4 Abb. 307; Lawrence v. Wright, 2 Duer, 674), that a corporation exceeded its plowers (Bald- tcin v. Buffalo, 29 Barb. 401), that a party failed to fulfill his obligations (Van Sc7laick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 95), that an act was illegal (Ransford v. Copeland, 6 Ad. & El. 486), that a party is or is not indebted (Merritt v. Millard, 5 Bosw. 625; Liennu v. Lincoln, 2 Duer, 670; Catlin v.

Peet, 23 Barb. 581), that an act was not done pur- suant to any statute (People v. M'Cuinber, 27 Barb. 632; 15 How. 186; 18 N. Y. 315), or that it was done contrary to statute (Smith v. Locklvood, sp. t., 13 Barb. 209, 216), or that it was injtcst (re Paine, sp. t., 1 Barb. 352), or un- lawful (Enlsign v. Sherman, sp. t., 13 How. 35; see S. 0., 14 id. 442; Ransford v. Copeland, 6 Ad. & El. 485), or void. (Baldwin v. Bu.ffalo, 29 Barb. 401; see M'Mfurray v. Gifford, sp. t., 5 How. 14; Hastings v. Thurston, sp. t., 10 Abb. 418; 18 How. 530.),Averments of law and fact intermingled. ]-The rule ex- cluding conclusions of law is not however to be enforced too rigidly. Mixed allegations of law and fact are frequently allowed, sometimes to avoid prolixity, and in other cases because such allegations are quite as much in harmony with the ordinary usages of speech, and as readily understood as the pure facts upon which they are based. (See Decker v. Matihews, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 324; Ensign v. Sherman, 14 How. 439; Walter v. Locetkood, 23 Barb. 228; 4 Abb. 307; Cady v. Allen, 22 Barb. 395; Woodbury v. Sackrider, 2 Abb. 405; Davis v. Hop- pock7, 6 Duer, 256; Hayden v. Palmer, 24 Wend. 364.) And in general, such allegations, even when objectionable in form, are not absolutely nullities, and are good on demurrer. (See Brown v. Richardson, 20 N. Y. 472; People v. lyder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433.),For these reasons, in pleading title to real estate (Walter v. Lockwood, 23 Barb. 233; 4 Abb. 307; Ensign 12
Fact only to be pleaded. Arguments not facts. v. Sherman, 14 How. 439; rev'g S. 0., 13 id. 35; People y. jayor of N. Y., sp. t., 8 Abb. 19; Sanders v. Leavy, sp. t., 16 How. 308; overruling Lawrence v. Wright, 2 Ducr, 673), or to goods and chattels (Davis v. Hoppocl, 6 Duer, 256), ii is sufficient to allege that the pleader is the "owner" thereof. But in pleading title to a thing in action, as a bill or note (White v. Brown, sp. t., 15 How. 282; ,Seeley v. Engell, 17 Barb. 530), or debt (Tomnas v. Deesmolld, sp. t., 12 How. 321; Adams v. Holley, sp. t., id. 330), the pleader's title should be concisely traced down from the original owner. The reason of the dis- tinction is obvious. It is always within the power of a pleader to show how the title to a note or a debt was created, while it is rarely possible for him to know who first acquired title to a piece of tangible personal property, and never possible to state the primal source of title to land. The pleader may therefore as well stop at the allegation of ownership in himself, as to go back through a hundred owners, and finally be reduced to a general averment of ownership in somebody else. Some of the cases we have cited in regard to notes and debts hold the allegation of ownership bad on demur- rer. But in this they are erroneous. (Prindlev. Carut7ters, 15 N. Y. 431; Brown v. lichardson, 20 N. Y. 472; Holstein v. Rice, sp. t., 15 How. 1; Taylor v. Corbiere, sp. t., 8 How. 385; Banil of Geneva v. Gulick, sp. t., id. 54.) The fault is merely argumentativeness, and is a ground only for a motion under Â§ 160. (Prindle v. Carn- thers, Brown v. Ric7hardson, supra.) Arguments.]-Arguments are not facts, and therefore pleadings must not contain arguments. (Gould v. Williams sp. t., 9 How. 51.) Nor should the facts be averred in an argumentative form, but they should be directly asserted. (Lewis v. Kendall, sp. t., 6 How. 59, 66; Lipe v. Becker, 1 Denio, 568; Sloan v. Little, 3 Paige, 116; M'Keon v. Lanc, 1 Hall, 319; see Huntter v. Powell, 15 How. 221; Arthur v. Broo7;s, 14 Barb. 536; Boyce v. Brown, 7 Barb. 85;,13
Facts only to be pleaded. Arguments Hypotheses. 3 How. 394; Garrison v. Clark, 11 Ind. 371; Bolton v. Gardner, 3 Paige, 278; Hood v. Inman, 4 Johns. Ch. 440.),A pleading is not, however, demurrable on this ground (Prindle v. Caru.thers, 15 N. Y. 425; Spencer v. Southwick, 9 Johns. 314), and facts, argumentatively pleaded, may be proved on the trial. (Brown v. Richardson, 20 N. Y. 472.),The proper remedy against such errors is by motion under Â§ 160 of the Code. (Prindle v. Caruthers, Brown v. Richardson, supra.),Hypotheses.]-Hypotheses are not facts, and therefore pleadings should not usually be in a hypothetical or al- ternative form. (Hunter v. Powell, 15 How. 221, Hamilton v. Hough, sp. t., 13 How. 14; Lewis v. Acker, 11 How. 163; Corbin v. George, sp. t., 2 Abb. 465; Sayles v. Wooden, sp. t., 6 How. 84; Lewis v. Kendall, sp. t., 6 How. 59; Wise v. Fanning, sp. t., 9 How. 543; Porter v. M'Creedy, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S., 88; M'Murray v. Gifford, sp. t., 5 How. 14; Boyce v. Brown, 7 Barb. 80; 3 How. 391; see Dovan v. Dinsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503.),This rule has, however, been laid down too broadly in some cases. A careful examination of them will show that the best authorities forbid hypothetical pleading only where it is used evasively with intent to avoid a plain statement of facts which it is in the power of the pleader to give. It is not encouraged, because it can be easily used for such a purpose, but wherever this form of pleading is used in good faith, and from necessity, it is allowed. (Dovan v. Dinsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503; Brown v. Rycl7man, sp. t., 12 How. 313; Van Rensselaer v. Layman, sp. t., 10. How. 505; Ketchaim v. Zerega, 1 E. D. Smith, 559.),In any case, a fault in this respect is no ground for a demurrer, but must be corrected by motion. 14
All esential facts to be pleaded. Nothing provable unless pleaded.,AnT. 2.-All essential facts to be pleaded. Every fact which, at common law or in equity, was necessary to sustain the pleader's case, must be alleged in his pleading (M'Kyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297; Prin- dle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425; Allen v. Patterson, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 476; Freenma v. iulton Ins. Co., 14 Abb. 398; Rodi v. Rttgers Ins. Co., 6 Bosw. 23; Bank of United States v. Smith, 11 Wheat. 174; Teoier v. Gou in, 5 Duer, 389; Safford v. Drew, 3 Duer, 632; Smith. v. Leland, 2 Duer, 497; M'Millan v. Saratoga R. R. Co., 20 Barb. 455), and if the action or defense is founded upon a right given by statute, the pleading must state all the facts required to bring the case within the statute (Brown v. Harwon, 21 Barb. 508); but it is not necessary, in an action upon a right given by the common law, but restricted by statute, to allege in pleading the facts which show that the pleader's right is valid notwithstanding the statute. (Hilliard v. Austin, 17 Barb. 141; }Vashburn v. Franklin, sp. t., 7 Abb. 8; 28 Barb. 27; Livingston v. Smith, 14 How. 490; Stern v. Drinker, 2 E. D. Smith, 406; Dewey v. Hoag, sp. t., 15 Barb. 365; overruling, in effect, Thurnman v. Stevens, 2 Duer, 609. See Horner v. Wood, 23 N. Y. 350; aff'g S. 0., 15 Barb. 371.) Not only will a demurrer lie, where enough facts are not stated to constitute a cause of action or a defense, but nothing can be proved on the trial that is not alleged in the pleadings (M'Kyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297; Kis- sar v. Roberts, 6 Bosw. 154; Texier v. Gouin, 5 Duer, 389; Pier v. Finch, 29 Barb. 170; Beatty v. Swarthout, 32 Barb. 293; Bucknam v. Brett, 13 Abb. 119; Bristol v. Penn. R.

Jonas, 7 Ind. 716), and if such matters should incidentally appear by the evidence, they will be disregarded. (Brazill,15
-- Proof of facts not well pleaded. No other facts to be pleaded. v. Isuam,, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 18; Robbins v. Ricd7tarson, 2 Bosw. 255; see Flield v. Mayor &c. of N. Y. 6 N. y. [2 Seld.] 189.),But evidence may be given of a fact vaguely and defectively pleaded (Bro2wn v. Richardson, 20 N. Y. 472; S. 0., 1 Bosw. 405; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Prot. Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. 85; rev'g S. 0., 20 Barb. 468; Seeley v. Engell, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 548; rev'g S. ., 17 Barb. 530; Currie v. Cowles, 6 Bosw. 452), and it is within the discretion of the court to receive evidence of a fact not pleaded, and to treat the pleading as amended by an insertion of such an allegation. (Lounsbury v. Purdly, 18 N. Y. 515; see Cardell v. M'Niel, 21 N. Y. 336; .Bennett v. Judcson, id. 238.) Where the fact omitted is but one of a chain of circumstances, of which the rest are stated, it is the duty of the court to admit evidence of such fact, and to conform the pleadings thereto, even though the defect is one that would have been fatal on demurrer. (White v. Spencer, 14 N. Y. 247.),This rule is of course to be taken as applying only to facts which the pleader has a legitimate opportunity to set up. Facts in avoidance of an answer or reply may be proved without being pleaded. (Code, Â§168.),ART. 3. No other facts to be pleadel. Nothing need be alleged in a pleading, which is not necessary to be proved at the trial. (Decker v. Mathlews, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 320; Ensign v. Sherman, 14 How. 439; Shoe & Leather _Bank v. Brovwn, sp. t., 9 Abb. 220; Hunt v. Hudson River Ins. Co., 2 Duer, 487; Union Ins. Co. v. Osgood, 1 Duer, 707; Bank of VU. S. v. Smit7h, 11 Wheat. 174; Powler v. N. Y. Indemnnity Ins. Co., 23 Barb. 143.) It has been commonly supposed that certain negative allegations, such as the non-payment of a debt, must be pleaded, although not necessary to be proved. But even the allegation of non-payment appears to be in 16
No other facts to be pleaded. Evidence not to be pleaded. strictness unnecessary. (See Lanning v. Carpenter, 20 N. y. 447, 458; M'Kyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297.) None but material and issuable facts may be pleaded. (Man!l v. Morcwood, 5 Sands. 557; Rensselaer & Wlash. p. S. Co. v. Wetsel, sp. t., 6 How. 68; Williams v. HIayes, sp.t., 5 How. 470.) And though a pleading may state any facts bearing upon the final judgment in the action (Howard v. Tiffany, 3 Sands. 695), it need not (Corwin v. Freland, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 560; rev'g S. C. 6 How. 241; Clleney v. Garbutt, sp. t., 5 H-ow. 467) and must not (Lee v. Elias, 3 Sands. 737; Code Rep. N. S. 116; Sellar v. Sage, sp. t., 13 How. 231; Field v. Morse, sp. t., 8 How. 47; Pitnlam? v. Piitnam, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 64) contain any allegations which affect only the right of a party to a provisional remedy. Evidence not to be p)leatlded.]-Tle material facts only, and not the circumstances which tend to prove those facts, are to be pleaded. Evidence is to be reserved for the trial, and not spread upon the record. (People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 438; Allen v. Patterson, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 476; IHyatt v. PM]l ah oni, 25 Barb. 465; Hatch v. Peet, 23 Barb. 582; Walter v. Lockwiood, 23 Barb. 228 ; 4 Abb. 307; Boyce v. Brown, 7 Barb. 80; Smith v. Brown, 17 Barb. 431; Eddy v.

Hitchins, sp. t., id. 98; Knowles v. Gee, sp. t., id. 317; 8 Barb. 350; Floyd v. DearbornJ, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 17.) Facts from which another fact, material to the issue, is to be inferred, ought not to be pleaded. This is the substance of the rule against pleading evidence. (Sanlderson v. Colnlman, 4 Man. & Gr. 221.) A statement of facts tending to prove the ultimate fact upon which the claim or defense is founded, and which, if submitted to a jury, might justify a verdict for,3,17
Evidence not to be pleaded. Anticipating defense. the pleader, may often nevertheless be wholly insufficient as a pleading (see Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Buzzard v. Knapp, sp. t., 12 How. 506; Page v. Boyd, sp. t., 11 How. 417); for a pleading must contain such averments that the law alone, without the aid of a jury, can infer that the pleader is entitled to the relief he asks. (Page v. Boyd, supra.,Anticipating denfelse.]-It is not necessary (Wolfe v. Ieowes, 20 N. Y. 197; Hunt v. Hudson River Ins. Co., 2 Duer, 481; Troy Fire Ins. Co. v. Cagrpeter, 4 Wise. 24; VWhetstone v. Bowser, 29 Penn. 65), nor, in general, proper (Sands v. St. John, 36 Barb. 628; 23 How. 140; Butler v. Mason, sp. t., 5 Abb. 40; 16 How. 546; Clark v. Har- wood,. sp. t., 8 How. 170) to anticipate and avoid the plea of an adverse party.,Thus it has been held that the defense of the statute of limitations cannot be a ,oided by anticipation (Sands v. St. Joihn, Butler v. Mason, supra); and in an action for negligence it is not necessary to aver that the plaintiff was free from negligence (Johnson v. Hudson River 1. R. 7o., 20 N. Y. 65; Richards v. Westcott, 2 Bosw. (;02; Wolfe v. Sup'rs of Richmond, sp. t., 11 Abb. 270; 19 How. 370); nor, in suing upon a thing in action, is it necessary to aver that the plaintiff has not parted with it since he acquired it. (Niblo v. Harrison, sp. t., 7 Abb. 447; Van Rensselaer v. Bonesteel, 24 Barb. 370;* Taylor v. Corbiere, sp. t., 8 How. 385.),But in some cases a complaint has been allowed to anticipate and avoid the defense (Wade v. Rusher, 4 Bosw. 537; Bracket v. Wilkinson, sp. t., 13 How. 103; Tlwmpson v. Minford, sp. t., 11 id. 275; see P.illips v. Gorhtam, 17 N. Y. 270), and we think that, under the Code, the plaintiff has a right to do so, notwithstanding the decision to the contrary in Sands v. St. John, supra.,It is unquestionably allowable to anticipate and admit,* Affirmed in Court of Appeals, July 3, 1863. 18

Thus a partial payment may be admitted, and, where it is known to be the only defense, it is much the better plan to admit it in the complaint. ART. 4. Matters presumed, implied, or judicially noticed,,need not be pleaded. Implications.]-A pleader is not bound to allege any- thing which is necessarily implied. (Hunt v. Bennett, 19 N.

Thus, an allegation that a party "made" a promissory note, implies a delivery (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425; Peets v. Bratt, sp. t., 6 Barb. 662; Lafayette Ins. Co. v. Rogers, 30 Barb. 491); and so does an allegation of indorsement (Bank of Lowville v. Edwards, sp. t., 11 How. 216; N. Y. Marbled Iron WVorcs v. Smith, 4 Duer, 362; Griswold v. Laverty, 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 316; 3 Duer, 690; Marston v. Allen, 8 Mees. & W. 494); and so of acceptance. (Churchill v. Gardiner, 7 T. R. 596.) It is on this principle that it is not necessary to state that a con- tract was made in writing, even though it is of a species required by statute to be so made, for there could in such case be no agreement, legally speaking, unless it was in writing. (Livingston v. Smith, 14 How. 492; Banct of Iiowville v. Edwards, sp. t., 11 id. 216; Cozine v. Graham, 2 Paige, 177; Chamnplin v. Parish, 11 id. 405; Coles v. Bowne, 10 id. 526.) All implied allegations may of course be made the sub- ject of an issue, in like manner as if they were expressly pleaded. (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 429; Marston v. Allen, 8 Mees. & W. 494.),19
Presumptions. Matters judicially noticed. Presunmptions.]-It is not necessary to allege anything that the law will presume. (See Hunt v. Bennett, 19 N. Y. 173; Fan Rensselaer v. Bonesteel, 24 Barb. 370.),Thus, it is presumed, that a libel is false, inasmuch as every man is presumed to be innocent of criminal or dis. graceful acts (Hunt v. Bennett, 19 N. Y. 173); and so it is presumed that an act is done in a lawful manner (Chau. tauquaw Balnk v. Risley, 19 N. Y. 381; Mechanics' Bankitng Asso. v. Spring Valley Shot & Lead Co., 25 Barb. 420); and so as to make it legally valid (Clamplin v. Parish, 11 Paige, 405; Coles v. Bowne, 10 id. 526; Cozine v. Graham, 2 id. 177), it is therefore unnecessary to plead the facts which establish such presumptions. (Ib.),Matters judicially noticed.]-It is unnecessary to state, in pleading any matters of which the court will take judicial notice (Suatw v. Tobias, 3 N. Y. [3 Com.] 188; Brown v. Harmon, 21 Wend. 508; Goelet v. Cowdrey, 1 Duer, 132), such as public statutes of this state (ib., Yertore v. Wiswall, 16 How. 8; Bayard v. Smit7, 17 Wend. 90; Carris v. Ingalls, 12 Wend. 70; Van Hook v. W7iitlock, 7 Paige, 373; Bogardus v. Trinity Church, 4 id. 178; asf'd 15 Wend. 111) or of the United States (Jack v. Martin, 12 Wend. 329; asf'd 14 id. 507); or the civil divisions of this state. (Chaapman v. Wilber, 6 Hill, 475; People v. Breese, 7 Cow. 430.),But the laws of other states of the Union, and of course those of foreign nations, will not be judicially noticed, and must be pleaded as facts (Ruse v. Mutual Benefit Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 516; Thatcher v. Morris, 11 N.Y. [1 Kern.] 439; Monroe v. Douglass, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 452); and so must corporation ordinances of cities, even in this state. (People v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 7 How. 81; Harker v. Mayor of N. Y., 17 Wend. 199.) 20
Intelligibility. Particularity. Time.,CHAPTER XXXV. HOW THE FACr S SHOULD BE PLEADED. ABTICLE 1. Intelligibilityand particularity.,2. Conciseness. 3. Positiveness. ART. 1. Intelligibility and particularity. Every pleading must be sufficiently definite and cer- tain in its statements to make the precise nature of the charge or defense apparent to the court and to the adverse party. (Code, Â§ 160.) Intelligibilitly.]-Pleadings must therefore be intelligi- ble, as much under the new system as under the former. (Boye v. Brown, sp. t., 3 How. 391; asf'd, 7 Barb. 80.) They are expressly required by the Code to be couched in plain and ordinary language. (Code, QÂ§ 142, 149, 153.) Particularity.]-Pleadings must, in order to be "cer- tain," give sufficient particulars of the transactions stated to enable the adverse parties to identify the circum- stances. For this purpose, several descriptive allegations are required, which, though they cannot be made the subject of an issue, and are not strictly material to the cause of action, are nevertheless necessary to identify the precise claim or defense set up. Time.]-Thus the time at which a transaction occurred ought to be stated (Chesbrotugl v. N. Y. & Erie .R. R. Co., sp. t., 26 Barb. 9; 13 How. 557; BlanlMa rd v. Strait, sp. t., 8 How. 83); or, if a large number of transactions are included in the statements of a pleading, it should show within what period they all occurred. (1'arcy v. Lee, sp. t., 10 Abb. 143.) But the pleader will not be bound at the trial to prove that the event occurred at the time alleged. (Lester v. Jewvett, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 460; LAjon v. Clark, 8,. Y. [4 Seld.] 157; Potter v. Thompson, 22 Barb. 89; Walden v. Crafts, 2 Abb. 302; S. 0., 4 E. D. Smith, 490;,21
Particnlarity. Place. Quantity. IHovey v. American Mutual Ins. Co., 2 Duer, 567; Amory v. M'WGregor, 12 Johns. 288.),If the only aspect in which a date is important is to show whether a certain event was prior or subsequent to another, it is sufficient to state that the one was prior to the other, without specifying dates. (Martin v. Eanouse, 2 Abb. 330; see Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 id. 286.),If a good reason is shown for the pleader's inability to fix upon the date, he is excused from doing so. Thus, where he had lost a deed executed to him, he was relieved from the necessity of showing its date. (Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 Abb. 286.),Place.]-Under the old system of pleading it was also necessary to state the place at which any material fact occurred, but this degenerated into a mere form which is entirely obsolete. It is now necessary to state the place at which an event took place, only when without such description the transaction might be difficult to identify.,In some cases an averment of place is actually a material issue. Thus, in an action on a contract void by the law of our state, it is material to show that it was made in a state where such contracts are by law valid (lhatc7er v. Morris, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 440), and so in suing under a statute applicable only to this state, the complaint must not leave it doubtful whether the transaction occurred within the state or not (Beach v. Bay State Co., 10 Abb. 71; 30 Barb. 433; 6 Abb. 415), and in pleading performance of an act required to be done at a particular place, the place of performance must be alleged. (Ferner v. Williams, 14 Abb. 215; U. S. Banik v. Smith, 11 Wheat. 171; Saul v. Jones, 1 El. & El. 59.),Quantity.]-In regard to averments of quantities and amounts, the only test to be applied is: are such aver- ments, in the particular case in hand, necessary to make the pleading specific?
particularity. Value. her particulars.,Yalue.]-In general, some statement of the value of a thing in controversy is necessary, as a matter of descrip- tion, in all actions brought for the recovery of money. Bat, except in an action on contract for the recovery of the reasonable price of a thing (Gregory v. Wright, sp. t., 11 Abb. 417), averments of value are not issuable. (Hackett v. Richards, 3 E. D. Smith, 13; Connoss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 315; see Woodruff v. Cook, 25 Barb. 510; over- ruling, in effect, Archer v. Boudinet, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 373.) Otherlparticulars.]-Whatever particulars, besides those mentioned, may be necessary to prevent surprise at the trial, or to protect parties from injustice or fraud, should be stated. Thus, in every case in which a claim is founded upon instruments for the payment of money, they should be separately described, so far as to identify them, and pre- vent the possibility of a recovery at the trial upon instru- ments not in the possession of the claimant at the com- mencement of the action. (Gray v. Kendall, 5 Bosw. 666; 10 Abb. 66.) Excessive particularity not required.]-Pleadings are not required to give all the details of the transactions to which they relate. If they clearly apprise the parties of the precise nature and extent of the charge or defense, and enable them to prepare for trial, nothing more can be required. (Sloman v. Schmidt, 8 Abb. 5; McKinney v. MelKinneey, sp. t., 12 How. 22.) Thus, in an action for money collected by the defend- ants as agents for the plaintiffs, the complaint need not state in detail the precise claims upon which the defend- ants collected the money. (Slonan v. Schmidt, supra.) Less particularity is required concerning facts best known to the adverse party.]-This was an established rule under the old system of pleading (Stephen on PlMd. 370; Van,23
Particularity. Remedy aaainst error.,-- Rlensselaer v. Jones, 2 Barb. 655; People v. Dtunlap, 13 Johns. 440; Norton v. Vultee, 1 Hall, 385; Bartlett v. Benson, 14 5Mees. & W. 732, 739); and it is so clearly reasonable that its validity under the new system cannot be doubted. It is also sustained by decisions under the Code. (See NYllis v. De Forest, 16 Barb. 67; Stoddard v. Onondafga Conference, 12 Barb. 573; Richards v. Edicl;, sp. t., 17 id. 260; ,Vest v. Brewster, 1 Duer, 647.),Thus, in an action by an executor or administrator, it is proper that he should show how he was appointed; l)bt in an action against him, it is unreasonable to require the plaintiff to state the details of a transaction with which the defendant must be necessarily flr more familiar.,So a pleader cannot justly be required to specify the times anld places at which his adversary performed any acts in which tlhe former took no part.,lRecmetldy against error..]-The only remedy against a want of precision and particularity in a pleading is by motion to mlake it more definite and certain, under Â§ 160 of the Code. (Dagal v. Simmons, '`3 N. Y. 491; Seeley v. Engell, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 542; People v. Ryder, 12 K. Y. [2 Kern.] 433; Warren, v. Philips, 30 Barb. 646; C'ark v. Dales, 20 Barb. 42 ; Graham v. C'amman, 5 Duer, 697 ; 13 How. 360; (Farmers' & Citizens' Bank v. Shernman, 6 Bosw. 181.) No dlemurrer will lie for such cause. (Ib.),If, however, a pleading leaves not merely the attendant circumstances, but the very existence of the main facts themselves in uncertainty, it is bad on demurrer. (Free- tman v. Fulton Insurance Co., 14 Abb. 407; Page v. Boyd, sp. t., 11 How. 417; Williams v. Ins. Co. of N. ., sp. t., 9 id. 374; Lewis v. Kendall, sp. t., 6 How. 64; see 1Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62.),ART. 2.-Conciseness. All pleadings are required to be concise, and to contain no unnecessary repetition. (Code, 'Â§ 142, 149, 153.)
Conciseness. Repetition not allowed. Remedy against error. Conciseness.]-Facts should be stated in a simple, though logical form, and in as few words as possible. For the sake of conciseness, the courts permit a mode of pleading not strictly regular, as for instance, aver- ments of law and fact intermingled, or argumentative allegations, where pure allegations of fact would lead to great prolixity. (See ante, Ip. 12.) Rel)etition Lot allowed.]-Pleadings must not repeat the same facts, even under a different form. A complaint or counterclaim is not allowed to set forth a single cause of action in several counts. (Fern v. Va(nderbilt, sp. t., 13 Abb. 72; Nash v. M'Cauley, sp. t., 9 id. 159; Dickens v. y. Y. Central R. R. Co., 13 How. 228; Sipperly v. Troy & Boston R. R. Co., 9 id. 83; Ford v. (Mattice, sp. t., 14 id. 91; Whittier v. Bates, sp. t., 2 Abb. 477; Dunning v. Thomas, sp. t., 11 How. 281; Lack;ey v. anlderbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 155; Churchill v. Churchill, sp. t., 9 id. 552; Stoclkbridge Iron Co. v. M7ellen, sp. t., 5 id. 439.) The deci- sions are uniformly to the same effect, with the excep- tion of two cases (Birdseye v. Smith, 32 Barb. 217; Jones v. Palmer, sp. t., 1 Abb. 442), where, on account of peculiar circumstances, which made it difficult for the plaintiffs to rely upon a single form of statement, double counts were allowed. These last decisions were however erroneous. It is impossible that such a form of pleading can be true, and it is clearly repetitious. The only legiti- mate relief that can be afforded to a pleader embarrassed by uncertainty as to his facts, is to allow him to plead in a hypothetical or alternative form. That is sometimes necessary, but two counts upon the same cause of action are never necessary. Remedy against error.]-Superfluous matter may be stricken out on motion, as irrelevant or redundant. (Code, l160.) And this is the only proper remedy in such cases. No demurrer will lie on this ground (Meyer v. Vanc Collen, 28,4,25

Conciseness. Remedy against error. Positiveness.,----2- Barb. 230; 7 Abb. 222; Hillnman v. Hillnan, 14 How. 426; see Lackey v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 161), and though in some instances pleadings have been set aside for con. taining repetitions of the same matter in different counts (Sipperly v. Troy & Boston B. R. Co., 9 How. 83; Whittier v. Bates, sp. t., 2 Abb. 477; Churchill v. Churchill, sp. t.,9 How. 552; Dunning v. Thomas, sp. t., 11 How. 281); yet the only proper relief against such errors is to strike out all the counts except one (Fern v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 13 Abb. 72; Hepburn v. Babcock, sp. t., 9 Abb. 159 n.; Dick ens v. A. Y. Central R. R. Co., 13 How. 228; Lackey v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 155; Stockbridge Iron Co. v. Mellen, sp. t., 5 How. 439), giving the pleader in fault an opportunity to elect which count he will retain. (Ib.),ART. 3.-Positiveness. Facts should be directly and unequivocally averred, and not left to be gathered inferentially from sugges. tions, hints, or arguments; nor asserted in an ambiguous or equivocal form. (Arthur v. Brooks, 14 Barb. 533; Hood v. Inman, 4 Johns. Ch. 440; see St. John v. North- rup, 23 Barb. 29; Freeman v. Fulton Ins. Co., 14 Abb. 407.),Hypothetical or argumentative pleading, of which we have before spoken (ante, pp. 13, 14), is a violation of the rule here stated, and is allowed only under peculiar cir- cumstances.,An assertion that the party pleading "will prove on the trial the following facts," is not an averment of such facts for any purpose, and if they are not alleged in any other form, the pleading is bad on demurrer. (Lewis v. Kendall, sp. t., 6 How. 64.) So an averment that a party "furnished proof" of a certain fact to his opponent is not equivalent to an allegation of the fact in question. (Williams v. Ins. Co. of N. A., sp. t., 9 How. 374.),An averment that "the defendant says that he denies," &c., is not a denial, and is frivolous. (Blake v. Eldred, sp. t., 18 How. 240; Arthur v. Brooks, 14 Barb. 533.)
Positiveness. Remedy against error. This principle has been carried so far as to hold that a pleader is not at liberty to state that his averments are made upon information and belief. (Ricketts v. Green, sp. t., 6 Abb. 82; Truscott v. Dole, sp. t., 7 How. 226; Pat- terson v. Caldwell, 1 Metc. Ky. 492; Walters v. Chinn, id. 502.),This, however, is going too far. It is clear from the form of verification prescribed by the Code, that the legislature contemplated a distinction in pleadings be- tween averments made upon the knowledge of the pleader, and those made upon his belief; and though. owing to the defective language employed,* it is not necessary in any case to distinguish between these two classes of allegations, yet it is clearly allowable to do so. (St. Jchn v. Beers, sp. t., 24 How. 377; Radway v. Mather, 5 Sands. 654; Fry v. Bennett, id. 68; Code Rep, N. S. 249; Bement v. Wisner, sp. t., id. 143; Howell v. Fraser, sp. t., id. 270; see Borrowe v. Milbank, 5 Abb. 28.) Facts ought not to be pleaded by way of recital, but should be directly averred. (Stephen PI. 388; Salters v. Tobias, 3 Paige, 338; Wheeler v. Townsend, 3 Wend. 247; Wyman v. Mitchell, 1 Cow. 316.) Nevertheless, on de- murrer, or upon the cause going to trial on the issues of fact, matters recited in a pleadin (Price v. McClave, 6 Duer, 544; Bank of Geneva v. G-Wick, sp. t., 8 How. 51), or in a document embodied in a pleading (Slack v. Heath, 1 Abb. 331; 4 E. D. Smith, 95),f will be regarded as equivalent to positive allegations, if it can be inferred from the whole pleading that they were intended as such. Remedy against error.]-In general, a defect in direct- ness of averment is ground only for a motion under * It ought to be understood that the peculiar, rather cumbrous, and plainly ineffective form of verification prescribed by the Code, was not de- vised by the Commissioners of Practice, but was invented by the legisla- ture of 1849. t Affirmed in Ct. of Appeals, June, 1860.,27
Positiveness. Pleading an account of money obligation. Q 160. That is the only remedy, when enough is stated to enable the court rightfully to infer the material fact sought to be stated. (Brown v. Ricluardson, 20 N. Y. 472; Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425; People v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., sp. t., 8 Abb. 7; 28 Barb. 240.),But if the law alone, without the aid of a jury, and without exercising the functions of one, cannot infer the facts necessary to maintain the pleader's case, the plead. ing is bad on demurrer. (Page v. Boyd, sp. t., 11 How. 417; see Williams v. Ins. Co. of N. A., sp. t., 9 How. 374; Lecwis v. Kenldall, sp. t., 6 How. 64; see also lEmery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62.) So if a pleading leaves an essential fact in certainty, it is demurrable. (Free)man v. Futlton Ins. Co., 14 Abb. 407.) Or, if a defense is clearly evasive, it may be stricken out as sham. (Blake v. Eldred, sp. t., 18 How. 240.),CILHPTER XXXVI. EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING. In certain cases, for the sake of brevity, the Code waives the strict rules generally applicable to pleadings, and permits a looser form of statement. These excep- tions we shall but briWR indicate here.,Accounlt.]-It is not necessary, in pleading upon an account, to set forth all its items. (Code, Â§ 158; see Moset v. Saclcett, 18 N. Y. 522; Allen v. Patterson, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 476; Cttdlipp v. Whipple, 4 Duer, 610; Chesbrouglh v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., sp. t., 26 Barb. 12; 13 How. 557.) But the adverse party may, by demand in writing, require a copy of the account to be served upon him within ten days after such demand, and if the complaint is verified, such account must be also verified. (Code, 158.),Instrument for paying of money only.]-In an action or defense founded upon an instrument for the payment of 28
Conditions precedent. Jurisdiction. Libel and slander. Title to land. money only, it is sufficient to give a copy thereof, and to state that there is due to the pleader thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum, which lie claims. (Code, Â§ 162.) Conditions precelenlt.]-It is not necessary to state tile facts sllowing performance of conditions precedent, but it may be alleged generally that tile party pleading duly performed all the conditions on his part. (Code, Â§ 162.) Upon this allegation being denied, tlie party so pleading must prove, on the trial, the facts constituting a per- formance. (Ib.) It is to be observed that this rule does not extend to the pleading of conditions concurrent, which are distinct tlings fiomn conditions precedent. (See leecher v. Conradt, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 108; Diinham v. lMann, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 512.) In the English Common Law Procedure Act, special provision has been made for theml, but none is made by our Code. Jurisdictioll.]-In pleading a judicial determination of any cotut or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not neces- sary to allege the ihcts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. (Code, Â§ 161.) The jurisdiction of other courts is presumed, and need not, of course, be alleged. (Chematng Caal Jaank v. Judson, 8 N. Y. [4 Scld.] 254; Cruyt v. PlhilliJs, 7 Abb. 205; 16 How. 120.) Libel and Slander.]-For special rules concerning plead- ings in these actions, see Code, %Â§ 164, 165. Title to Land.]-In an action to recover animals dis- tained doing damage, the defendant need not set forth his title to the land upon which tile distress was made, but it is sufficient to state that he, or the person by whose con-,29
Pleadings taken together. Claims or defenses taken separately. mand he acted, was lawfully possessed of such land, and that the property distrained was, at the time, doing dam. age thereon. (Code, Â§ 166.),CHAPTER XXXVII. CONSTRUCTION OF PLEADINGS. Pleadings to be taken together.]-The whole of a plead. ing should be taken together, and broad, general state. ments in one part must be qualified by any more par- ticular averments in another part. (Hatch v. Peet, 23 Barb. 575; Page v. Boyd, 11 How. 415; see, per GREENE, J., Laub v. Buckimiller, 17 N. Y. 622.) The demand of judgment (Rodgers v. Rodgers, 11 Barb. 595; Chambers v. Lewis, sp. t., 10 Abb. 206; Dows v. (Treen, sp. t., 3 How. 377; Spalding v. Spalding, sp. t., id 297), and, if necessary, the summons (Sellar v. Sage, sp. t., 12 How. 531), though the latter has but little weight in this respect (Chambers v. Lewis, sp. t., 10 Abb, 206; 2 Hilt. 591; asf'd 11 Abb. 210), may be consulted for the pur- pose of ascertaining the nature of the action, where that question is of importance.,Eacht cause of action or defense to be taken seiarately.]- The rule that the whole pleading is to be taken together, must be understood with the qualification that each separate cause of action in a complaint, or defense in an answer or reply, is regarded as to all intents a distinct pleading. Neither party can ask the court to construe one of them with reference to another, to whijc it does not in terms itself refer, though both are contained in the same general pleading. (Xenia Bank v. Lee, 2 Bosw. 694; 7 Abb. 372; Swift v. Kingsley, 24 Barb. 541; Sin- clair v. Fitch, 3 E. D. Smith, 677.) And an admission in one cause of action or defense is an admission only for the purposes of the issue raised by that particular plead- ing, and not for the purposes of all the issues in the
pleadings to be liberally construed. Ambiguity. action. (Ayres v. Covill, 18 Barb. 260; Troy & Rutland R. R. Co. v. Kerr, 17 id. 581, 599; Robins v. Maidstone, 4 Q. B. 811.) Pleadings to be liberally construed.]-The allegations of a pleading are to be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties. (Code, Â§ 159.) Even on demurrer, pleadings must be liberally con- strued (Keteltas v. Myers, 19 N. Y. 231.; Allen v. Patter- son, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 476; Yertore v. Wiswnall, 16 How. 8; see People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433, 439), and upon an issue of fact being joined, a still more liberal rule of interpretation prevails. By omitting to demur (White v. Spencer, 14 I. . 247), or to move for a reformation of the pleading (Wall v. Buffalo Water Waorks Co., 18 N. X. 119), the adverse party waives all defects which he might in that way have pointed out, and virtually admits the sufficiency of the pleading. It will therefore be con- strued at the trial in favor of the pleader (Wall v. Buffalo Water Works, supra), and its defects, unless absolutely fatal in their character, will be amended or disregarded at the trial. (White v. Spencer, 14 N. Y. 247; St. John, v. tNorthrlp, 23 Barb. 30; Cady v. Allen, 22 Barb. 388; see Lounsbury v. Purdol, 18 N. Y. 515; Bennett v. Judson, 21 . Y. 238; Banlk of Havana v. Magee, 20 N. Y. 355.) Aibiguiity.]-But where a pleading is purposely made ambiguous, its allegations will be construed most strongly against the pleader, on demurrer or motion. (Beach v. Bay State Co., 10 Abb. 71; 30 Barb. 433; Ridder v. Whit- lock, sp. t., 12 How. 208.) These cases state the rule more broadly, but we think that they can be sustained only upon this ground. (Compare Allen v. Patterson, 7 N. Y. [p Seld.] 476.),31
When required. Complaint need not be.,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,VERIFICATION. ARTICLE 1. When verification is required.,2. When it may be omitted. 3. Mode of verification. 4. Verification by agent, officer, or guardian. 5. Proceedings on defect of verification. ART. 1. When verification is required. When any pleading is verified, every subsequent plead. ing, except a demurrer, must be verified also. (Code, Â§156.),If therefore the complaint is verified, the answer and reply must be verified. And though the complaint be unverified, yet if the answer is verified, the reply, if any, must be verified. (Levi v. Jakeways, sp. t., 4 How. 126; 2 Code Rep. 29, 69.),By " subsequent pleading" is meant that which is sub- sequent in legal order, not in time only. (Ilempstea v. Hemnpstead, sp. t., 7 How. 8.) Therefore an amended com- plaint, served after the receipt of a verified answer, need not be verified. (lb.),After an unverified complaint has been served, and an unverified answer has been received, the plaintiff cannot, by simply adding a verification to his complaint, compel the defendant to verify his answer. (White v. Bennett, sp. t., 7 How. 59; George v. lMcAvoy, sp. t., 6 id. 200.),The complaint need not in any case be verified, and therefore neither any defects in its verification, nor a total absence of verification, constitute any ground for objecting to it.

The omission from the copy served of the jurat, or of the name of the officer before whom the pleading was sworn to, is aradical defect. (Ib.) The defendant, in case the verifi- cation of the complaint is not regular, has, however, the right to serve an unverified answer.* (Hubbard v. National Pro. Is. Co., sp. t., 11 How. 149; Treadwell v. Fassett, sp. t., 10 id. 184; see Bank/ of Maine v. Buell, sp. t., 14 id. 311; Quilt v. Tilton, 2 Duer, 648.),AnT. 2. When verification may be omitted. Verification may be omitted in any case by a party who might be subjected to a prosecution for felony by admitting the truth of the opposite party's allegations (Code, Â§ 157); and also in any case where the party plead- ing would be privileged from testifying as a witness to the truth of any matter denied by his pleading. (Ante, i. 65; Labws 1854, c/i. 75.) Though no pleading can be used as evidence against the pleader in a criminal action against him (Code, Â§ 157), yet this does not affect his right to omit a verification thereof. (Springsted v. Robinson, sp. t., 8 How. 41; Clap- per v. Fitzpatrick, sp. t., 3 How. 314.) But if all criminal proceedings are barred by the statute of limitations, a witness is not excused from answering (see Henry v. Salina Bank, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 83); and therefore a pleader in the like case is not excused from verifying his pleading.t A witness is privileged from testifying, only when his testimony would have a tendency to expose him to pun- * In Broadway Bank v.

[1 Comst.] 83); and a pleader is therefore excused from verifying only in the like cases, (Lynch v. Todd, sp. t., 13 How. 546.),Exposure to liability for a civil debt is no excuse for a witness (3 R. S., 5th ed. 690; [2 ib. 405]), and therefore none for a pleader (Wolcott v. Winston, sp. t., 8 Abb. 422; Lyiwh v. Todd, sp. t., 13 How. 546), even though a mere stakeholder in a wager, who is sued for money so received and paid over by him to the winner before suit. (Lynch v. Todd, supra.) Nor can a verification be omitted on the ground that an admission of the facts charged would degrade the pleader's character. (See Sweet v. Sweet, sp. t., 15 How. 169; Olney v. Olney, sp. t., 7 Abb. 350; but see Wheeler v. Dixon, sp. t., 14 How. 151.),The defendant in an action for libel (Blaisdell v. Ray- mond, 6 Abb. 148; 5 id. 144; see Scoville v. New, sp. t., 12 How. 319), or assault and battery (Moloney v. Dows, 2 Hilt. 247; Wheeler v. Dixon, sp. t., 14 How. 151; Springsted v. Robinson, sp. t., 8 id. 41; Clapper v. Sitz. patrick, sp. t., 3 id. 314), or for divorce on the ground of adultery (Anable v. Anable, sp. t., 24 How. 92), need not verify his answer.,A party having the right to omit a verification is none the less bound to plead, or submit to the usual conse- quences of a failure to plead.

fse, that the matter charged is such as to entitle the party to omit verification, no affidavit is necessary (Blais- deg v. Raymond, sp. t., 5 Abb. 144; affirmed, 6 id. 148; Wheeler v. Dixon, sp. t., 14 How. 151; Springsted v. Robinson, sp. t., 8 id. 41), but in any other case the party omitting to verify must serve with his pleading an affida- vit of the facts which justify his omission. (Lyjcwh v. Todd. sp. t., 13 How. 546; and see cases supra.) As a witness is not bound to state how an answer would criminate him (Henry v. Salina Bank, 1 N. Y. [1 Oomst.] 83), so a pleader need not do more than swear that an admission of the allegations against him might subject him to prosecution for a felony, or otherwise, as the case may be. (Springsted v. Robinson, sp. t., 8 How. 41.),ART. 3.-Mode of verification. Verification is to be made by affidavit (Code, Â§ 157), subscribed by the party making it (Laimbeer v.

pleading is true to the knowledge of the person verifying, except as to those matters therein stated on belief, and as to those matters, that he believes it to be true. (Code, Â§ 157.),It is advisable to pursue this form strictly, as no sub- stantial deviation is allowed (Waggoner v. Brown, sp. t., 8 How. 212), though a literal adherence to it is not required. (Kincaid v. Zip, 1 Duer, 692; see Radway v. Mather, 5 Sands. 655.),Thus, it is insufficient to swear merely " that the answer is true" (Tibbals v. Selfridge, sp. t., 12 How. 64; Williana v. Riel, 5 Duer, 601; 11 How. 374*), or " that it is substan. tially true of the deponent's own knowledge" (Waggoler v. Brown, sp. t., 8 How. 212), or "that it is true, accord. ing to the best of his knowledge and belief." (rotl .orr, v. Mlonitgomery, sp. t., 5 How. 238.),On the other hand, a verification is sufficient, which states that the answer "is true to the deponent's own knowledge" (Kincail v. Kli)p, 1 Duer, 692; see Ross v.

If the claim or defense is founded solely upon a written instrument for the payment of money only, which is in the possession of such agent or attorney. (Code Â§ 157.) 2. If all the material allegations of the pleading so verified are within the personal knowledge of such veri- fiant. (lb.; Gourney v. Wersuland, 3 Duer, 613.) 3.

It is not essential that the agent or attorney should have personal knowledge of the facts stated in the plead- ing, in any case except when he puts his right to verify solely upon that ground.

(Drevert v. Appsert, sp. t., 2 Abb. 165.),When the verification is made by an agent, he must be an agent for the party in relation to the subject of the action, and not a mere proxy for the purpose of verifying the pleading. (Boston Locomotive Works v. Wright, sp. t., 15 How. 253.),Form of such verificatioit.]-In every case in which veri- fication is made by the agent or attorney, he must state in the affidavit his personal knowledge of the facts, or else set forth the grounds of his belief on the subject, and must also set forth the reasons why it is not made by the party in person. (Code, Â§ 157; as construed in Soutter v. Matler, sp. t., 14 Abb. 440; Boston Locomotive Works v. Wright, sp. t., 15 How. 253; People v. Allen, sp. t., 14 id. 334; Bank of Maine v.

Mattice, sp. t., 7 id. 4; Fitch v. Bigelow, sp. t., 5 id. 237.) It has been held, in some cases, a suffi- cient statement of the grounds of belief, in an action upon instruments for the payment of money only, to aver that such instruments are in the possession of the attorney or agent (Myers v. Gerrits, 13 Abb. 106;t Smith v. Rosenthal, sp. t., 11 How. 442), but the contrary has been held in other cases. (Soutter v. Matler; Boston Locomotive Works v. Wright; Bank of Maine v.

sn ; Hubbard v. Nat. Pro. Ins. Co.; TrearweU v. Fassett; Stannard v. Mattice; supra.) The very slightest grounds of belief will, however, be sufficient in such a case. (Wheeler v. Chesley, sp. t., 14 Abb. 441.) The Code does not require any statement of the means of knlowledge possessed by the verifiant (see Ross v. Long- mauir, 15 Abb. 326), but it should be understood that mere information, even of the most conclusive Iind, such as the admissions of the adverse party, cannot give know- ledge of the facts, and must therefore be set forth as a ground of belief. (Wilkin v. ailman, sp. t., 13 How. 225.) In regard to the statement of the reasons why the party does not himself verify the pleading, it is clearly sufficient to set forth the facts which justify such omission, without expressly stating that for those reasons he does not verify personally.,178.

such case. (Glaubensklee v. Hamburgh Packet Co., sp. t., 9 Abb. 104.) The affidavit in such case must aver the official capacity of the deponent, but differs in no other respect from the ordinary form. (Â§ 176.),WIten the state is a party.]-When the state, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with the facts. (Code, Â§ 157.) By guardian of infant.]-The guardian ad literm of an infant is considered a party to the action for the purpose of verification (Anable v. Anable, sp. t., 24 How. 92; see Hill v. Tilacter, sp. t., 3 How. 407), and it would there- fore seem that a verification by him in the common form (Â§ 176) is sufficient, without stating the grounds of his belief. The fact of his guardianship will of course appear by the pleading which he verifies, and need not therefore be reiterated.,AnT. 5.-Proceedings on defect of verification. What is a defect.]-Not only is a failure to conform to the rules heretofore stated, in the actual verification, a defect fatal to the verification as such, but the copy of the pleading served must show on its face that all the requirements of law have been complied with, or it may be treated as defective, whether the original is correct, or not. (Hughes v. Wood, 5 Duer, 603 n.; Graham v. MlcCoun, sp. t., 5 How. 353.) Unverified complaint.]-As the plaintiff is not bound to verify his complaint, his omission to do so affords no ground of application to the court. (See ante, p. 32.) Unverified answier or reply.]-If an answer (or reply) is served without verification, or with an insufficient verifi- cation, when the complaint (or answer) has been verified,,6,41 VERIFICATION.
the party on whom it is served should return it imme. diately, stating his reason for so doing (White v. Cum. mings, 3 Sands. 716; Code Rep. N. S., 107; see Wilkin v. Gilman, sp. t., 13 How. 225; Strout v. Curran, sp. t., 7 How. 36); and pointing out the precise defect. (Broad. way Bank v. Danforth, sp. t., 7 How. 264.),This is conceded to be the better practice, but if there is any doubt as to the necessity or sufficiency of the veri- fication, it seems that the aggrieved party may move to strike out the answer, and for judgment as for want of an answer (Wolcott v. Winston, sp. t., 8 Abb. 422; Tibbals v. Selfridge, sp. t., 12 How. 64); though it was held by 1HAmRIs, J., that if there is any doubt about the suffi. ciency of a verification, it is best to accept the pleading without objection. (Wilkinv. Gilman, sp. t., 13 How. 225.),If an unverified pleading is retained for any length of time without objection, the defect will be considered to have been waived. Thus, where a plaintiff retained such an answer nineteen days, and then returned it, he was held to have waived the objection. (White v. Cummings, 3 Sands. 716; Code Rep. N. S. 107; see also Hull v.

Proceedings in case of neglect to serve account. ART. 1.-Demand of account. It has already been mentioned (ante, p. 28) that in plead- ing on an account, it is not necessary to set forth its items. The adverse party may demand, in writing, a copy of the account, which must be delivered to him within ten days thereafter. (Code, 158.) If the complaint is verified, the account must be verified also, by the oath of the party, or, if within the personal knowledge of his agent or attorney, by such agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true. (lb.) After a copy of the account has been demanded, it is too late to move to make the pleading more definite and certain in respect of such account. (McKinney v. McKin- ney, sp. t., 12 How. 22.),Â§ 182. Demand of copy of account.

ART. 2.-Form of t7e account. The copy of account served should specify, with all reasonable particularity, the several items of demand, with the date, amount, and general character of each. (Kellogg v. Paine, sp. t., 8 How. 329.),The copy account need not, it seems, give a detailed statement of the amounts received from the adverse party on such account. (Williams v. Sl7aw, sp. t., 4 Abb. 209; Rycknlma v. Haight, 1P Johns. 222; Penplrase v. Crease, 1 Mees. & W. 36; overruling Adlington v. Apple- ton, 2 Camp. 410; Mitchell v. Wright, 1 Esp. 280; see Smith v.

The copy of account, when served, has the same effect on the trial as a bill of particulars, and the evidence must conform to it as if it were a part of the complaint: otherwise there will be a variance. ART. 5.-Proceedings in case of neglect to serve account. If a copy of the account is not delivered pursuant to demand or order, evidence of the matters contained in it will be precluded at the trial. (Code, Â§ 158.) It seems that if an account is duly delivered upon de- mand, duly verified (where necessary), the evidence will not be excluded, although the account be grossly defec- tive. A "further account" should be applied for. (Kellogg,45
Proceedings in case of neglect to serve account. Motion papers. v. Paine, sp. t., 8 How. 329.) But if the party from who.r a copy of account is demanded, wholly neglects to serve it, within the ten days prescribed, he will of course be precluded from giving evidence of it. If he omits to verify it, when his pleading is verified, we suppose it should be treated in the same manner as a pleading which has been improperly served unverified, viz.: returned, with a statement of the objection. (See ante, p. 42.),The better practice in regard to a defective account, or when none is served, is held to be, to apply to a special term of the court before the trial, for an order precluding the evidence. (Kellogg v. Paine, sp. t., 8 How. 329.) No doubt this course is the safest for both parties. It gives the party in default an opportunity to excuse himself, but on the other hand, it settles the question, if decided against him, and enables the other party to go to trial without any fear that the evidence may be allowed, and thus leaves him free to dispense with witnesses whom he might otherwise feel compelled, as a precaution, to have on hand.,185.

Though in many cases the same object might be attained by a motion to make the pleading more definite and certain, yet the existence of that remedy does not bar a resort to this. (Wetmore v. Jennys, sp. t., 1 Barb. 53.) A bill of particulars will not be ordered, where the items are better known to the party applying for it, than to the other party. (Young v. De Mott, sp. t., 1 Barb. 30; Ryckman v. Haight, 15 Johns. 222; see Williams v. Shaw, sp. t., 4 Abb. 209.) Nor will it be ordered when the same
* 1 In what cases required. Actions on wrongs. information has already been obtained by the applicant, in another form of proceeding. Thus, where a defendant had obtained an order that certain books of account should be submitted to his inspection, which from their nature must have included most or all of the items on which the action was brought, on a subsequent motion for a bill of particulars, it was held that unless it appeared that such particulars were not contained in the books, the motion should not be granted. (Depew v. Leal, 5 Duer, 664.),Actions on wrongs.]-As a general rule, a bill of par- ticulars will not be ordered in an action for a tort. (See Pylie v. Stephen, 6 Mees. & W., 813; Stannard v. Ullithorne, 3 Bing., N. C., 328; Snelling v. Chennells, 5 Dowl. P. C. 80.) Thus it will not be ordered in an action for injuries causing death (iMutrphy v. Kipp, 1 Duer, 659); nor, usually, in any action for personal injuries. (Semble, Derry v. Lloyd, 1 Chit. Rep. 726, per BEST, J.),This however is not because of the mere fact of the action being in tort, but because in such actions the complaint must almost always state the cause of action with sufficient distinctness to enable the defendant to prepare his defense. And if it does not, the most appro- priate remedy is by a motion to make the complaint more definite and certain.,There are some cases, however, in which this proceed- ing may be more appropriate, as avoiding great detail in the pleadings; and a bill of particulars has accordingly been ordered in an action for the conversion of personal property. (Humnphry v. Cortelyou, 4 Cow. 54.),In any action for a tort, an application for particulars should be accompanied with an affidavit that the defend- ant does not know what the plaintiff is suing for. (Snl- ling v. Chtennells, 5 Dowl. P. C. 80; see Key v. ThiMzlleby 6 Exch., 696.) 48
1 wllat cases required. Application for the order Affdavit. Actionls on conttract.]-In an action on a bill of exchange or promissory note, a bill of particulars of the considera- tion for such note, will not be ordered, unless possibly in a very special case. (Broo;s v. Farlar, 3 Bing. . C. 291.) But where it appeared that the notes sued on were given as security only, a bill of particulars of the amount actually due, was ordered. (Dawes v. Anstruther, 2 Mees. & V., 817; and see Platt v. Toswnsend, 3 Abb. 9; 5 Duer, 668.) In an action for breach of warranty of a horse, the court refused to require particulars of the unsoundness complained of. (Pylie v. Stephlen, 6 Mees & W., 813.),AlT. 2.--Alpplication for the order. W1len to be ilade.]-The application mlay be made at any time before trial. (Alndrews v. Clereland, 3 Wend. 431; see losecelt v. Gardiicr, 2 Cow. 463; Derry v. Lloyd, 1 Chit. Rep. 724.) But if the defendant has answered, his application for particulars will be regarded with suspicion. (Andrevws v. Clereland, 3 Wend. 437.) Who may grant the order.]-Altholugh the Code gives no authority to a judge out of court to make an order for a bill of particulars, we suppose that it does not abrogate the old practice in this respect, which allowed such an order to be made out of court, as may be seen by refer- ring to any of the old cases. (See 1 Burr. Pr. 430.) Affidlait.] -It was formally leld that an affidavit irould be required to obtain the order (Willis v. Bailey, 19 Johns. 268); but this was not required in practice, long before the Code, and is usually a matter of discre- tion with the judge. (1 Burr. Pr. 431.) It is certainly necessary in an application for particulars in an action for a trt. (Sinelling v. Chennells, 5 Dowl. P. C. 80.) If it is desired to extend the time for pleading by the order, an affidavit of merits must be made. (See Platt v. Townsend, 3 Abb. 9; 5 Duer, 668.),7,49

(Vermont Academy v. Landon, 2 Wend. 620.) And an order for a bill of particulars, with a stay of proceedings, will not prevent the plaintiff from taking judgment by default, unless it includes an order extending the time for answering, and is served with an affidavit of merits. (Platt v. Townsend, 3 Abb. 9; 5 Duer, 668.),The stay of proceedings under the alternative order ceases with the day fixed for showing cause, unless on that day a peremptory order is obtained. (Fassett v. Dorr, 1.1 Wend. 177; Andrews v. Cleveland, 3 Wend. 437.) But 52
The order. Effect of orders. The bill of particulars. if a peremptory order is then obtained, the stay of pro- ceedings continues, even though the peremptory order is not served. (Rowan v. Porter, 9 Wend. 443; see Fassett v. Dorr, 11 Wend. 177.),ART. 4.-The bill of particulars. The bill of particulars need not be in any particular form. (See Williams v. Allen, 7 Cow. 316; and note to Hurst v. Watdis, 1 Camp. 69.) It is sufficient, if it fully apprises the opposite party of the grounds of the claim. (Stowits v. Bank of Troy, 21 Wend. 186; see Smith v. Hicks, 5 Wend. 48; Brown v. Williams, 4 Wend. 368.) It need not state the names of the parties to the action (Gage v. Cary, 9 Cow. 44); and if it does so, an error in such names is of no importance. (Ib.) It is not necessary to give particulars of amounts credited to the adverse party (Williams v. Shlaw, sp. t., 4 Abb. 209; Ryckn.ma v. Haight, 15 Johns. 222); and, indeed, such payments need not be noticed by it at all. (Ryc7zckan v. IIaight, 15 Johns. 222.) It need not specify any demands except such as are set forth in a general manner; and therefore, where a complaint contained a count on a promissory note, and another on services, it was held that the bill of particulars properly omitted to mention the note, as it was set forth fully enough in the complaint. (People v. Monroe C. P., 4 Wend. 200.) And if an account has been rendered, it is sufficient to refer to it. (Goodrich ads. James, 1 Wend. 289.) But it is a contempt of court to make a bill of particu- lars as general and indefinite as the complaint itself. Brown v. Watts, 1 Taunt. 355; see Wetmore v. Jennys, sp. t., 1 Barb. 53; Stanley v. Millard, 4 Hill, 50.) The date of each transaction should be stated as accu- rately as possible. If the precise day is not remembered, the month or year must be given. (Humphry v. Cottleyou,,53
The bill of particulars. Proceedings on neglect to serve. 4 Cow. 54; see Kellogg v. Paine, sp. t., 8 How. 329.) The time stated is material in a bill of particulars. (Quin v. Astor, 2 Wend. 577.),Amending particulars.]-A bill of particulars may be amended on application to the court. (Code, Â§ 173; see Fuller v. Roosevelt, 4 Cow. 144.) It may be amended at almost any stage of the action, if consistent with substantial justice. (Spawn v. Feeder, 4 Cow. 503; Fuller v. Roosevelt, 4 Cow. 144.),The mode of obtaining an amendment is similar to that used in regard to pleadings generally. See the chap- ter on AMENDMENTS. ART. 5.-Proceedings in case of neglct to serve bill of,particulars. We cannot undertake to decide, absolutely, whether the old practice under this head is modified by the Code. A bill of particulars is so nearly alike to a copy of account, that it would seem unreasonable to award a different penalty for a neglect to serve the one, from that which is incurred by a neglect to serve the other. Neverthe- less, as the Code makes a distinction between the two, and does not apply the rules regarding accounts to par- ticulars, we cannot say that the old practice is not still in force, which was as hereafter stated.,Neglect of the plaintiff.]-If the plaintiff wholly neglect- ed to obey the peremptory order, the defendant might formerly move for judgment of non-pros. (Fleurot v. Du- rand, 14 Johns. 329; see Brewster v. Sackett, 1 Cow. 572), which was equivalent to a dismissal of the complaint under the Code. And if a bill was served which was clearly evasive, and showed on its face that the plaintiff did not intend to obey the order, judgment might be had in like manner. (Semble, Stanley v. Millard, 4 Hill, 50; Purdy v. Warden, 18 Wend. 671.)
Neglect of the plaintiff. When objection must be raised.,Unless the bill is palpably evasive, however, the proper course is to move for further particulars. (Stanley v. Mil- lard, 4 Hill, 50; see Purdy v. Warden, 18 Wend. 671; Goodrich ads. James, 1 Wend. 289.) Such order should specify the points upon which further particulars are required. (Kellogg v. Paine, sp. t., 8 How. 329.) And if, after such order, the plaintiff persists in serving an eva- sive bill, it is proper to apply for judgment, which will be granted, unless a satisfactory bill is served, and costs paid. (Wetmore v. Jennys, sp. t., 1 Barb. 53; see Stanley v. Millard, 4 Hill, 50.),Neglect of defendant.]--If the defendant neglects to serve a bill of particulars when ordered, he will be ex- cluded from giving evidence of the set-off or counter- claim, the particulars of which were required. (Mercer v. Sayre, 3 Johns. 248.) It would probably be best, in case of non-service of the defendant's particulars, to apply for a final order, abso- lutely debarring him from giving evidence of his counter- claim. The mode of proceeding is precisely similar to that used in cases of account. (See ante, p. 46 and the forms, Â§ 185 and Â§ 186. If particulars are served, how- ever evasive and unsatisfactory, such an application should unquestionably be made.,TWhent objection must be raised.]-An objection to the form of a bill of particulars, must be raised before the ! trial. No objection can avail then on either side, although the bill may be so general as to be a clear evasion of the order. (Barnes v. Henshlaw, 21 Wend. 426.),ART. 6.-Effect of bill of particulars. A bill of particulars is regarded as an amplification of the pleading to which it relates. (Bowman v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691; Starkweather v. Kittle, 17 Wend. 20; Gay v
When objection must be raised. Effect of bill of particulars, Cary, 9 Cow. 45; Ryckmnan v. Haight, 15 Johns. 222; see Brown v. Williams, 4 Wend. 368.) It has been generally treated in this state as forming part of the pleading. (Botwann v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691; Starckweather v. Kittle, 17 Wend. 20; Flecrot v. Durand, 14 Johns. 329.) But, after some hesitation, it was held in the King's Bench that an admission of the truth of a pleading did not admit the correctness of the bill of particulars served therewith. (Booth v. Howard, 5 Dowl. P. C. 441.),No proof is allowed at the trial of matters not con- tained in the bill of particulars. (Bonwmanb v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691; Quin v. Astor, 2 Wend. 577; see Macarthli v. Smitlh, 1 Moore & Scott, 227; 8 Bing. 145; Holland v. Hopkins, 2 Bos. & Pul. 243.) But the courts were always very liberal in regard to variances, where the opposite party had not been misled (Smith v. Hicks, 5 Wend. 48; McNair v. Gilbert, 3 id. 344; Duncan v. Ray, 19 id. 530); and, under the provisions of the Code, they are required to be even more so now. (Seaman v. Lowl, 4 Bosw. 337.)

What causes of action are indivisible. 3. Election between different causes of action. 4. Uniting causes of action. 5. Classification of actions. ART. 1.-W1hat is a single cause of action. A cause of action, although for the sake of brevity we shall call it a claim, is nevertheless not accurately de- scribed by that word. For upon a single cause of action the plaintiff may be entitled to several distinct kinds of relief. The cause of action is the defendant's wrongful act, and not the remedy which the plaintiff seeks. (See Spier v. Robinson, sp. t., 9 How. 325.) A single wrongful act, with all its subsidiary accompaniments, constitutes but one cause of action. And all those acts should be deemed subsidiary, which the defendant commits merely for the sake of carrying out his main purpose. A cause of action may therefore be complex, and capable of division into several claims, and nevertheless, until so divided, be in a proper sense but a single cause of action. Thus, where a contract for the payment of * As to the filing and service of the complaint, see ante, i. 361, 434-445.,8
What is a single cause of action. Various relief. money is by mistake so drawn as to relieve the defend. ant from paying that which both parties meant he should pay, his refusal to correct the error is caused solely by his unwillingness to pay the debt, and should be treated as subsidiary to his failure to pay. A complaint, there. fore, which demands that such a contract be reformed, and that the defendant fulfill his obligations under it as reformed, states but a single cause of action. (Gooding v. .PAlister, sp. t., 9 How. 123; see Bidwell v. Astor Mututlal Ins. Co., 16 N. Y. 263.) So a claim by a pledgor to redeem his pledge, to have an accounting from the pledgee for the amount received by him from the pledge, and to have the surplus paid and the debtor's notes returned to the pledgor, is founded only upon a single cause of action. (Calaoon v. Bank of Utica, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 486; 7 How. 401; rev'g S. C., 7 How. 134; 4 id. 423.) So a complaint seeking to set aside a fraudulent deed under which the defendant claims title to land, and demanding possession of the land, states a single cause of action. (See P7hillips v. Gorham, 17 N. Y. 270.),And in our opinion a complaint showing a valid con- tract for the sale of land from the defendant to the plain- tiff, and praying for the execution of a deed and the pos- session of the premises, states but one cause of action under the Code. The contrary has been held at general term, where it was also held that such claims could not be joined (Lattin v. M3'Carty, 8 Abb. 225; 17 How. 239); but the reasoning of the court in announcing its decision is clearly inconsistent with the intent of the Code, and the decisions of the Court of Appeals, and we think that the ruling of the court was altogether erroneous.,A complaint by a judgment creditor seeking to set aside various fraudulent conveyances made by the judg- ment debtor to various persons, states but one cause of action, notwithstanding his transferees did not act in concert with each other, and had no .ilterest in each others' transactions. (Ct. of Appeals, Reed v. Stry1er, 58

Hoyt, 5 Paige, 65; Nrewbould v. Warrin, sp. t., 14 Abb. 80); and this is so, whether the fraudulent transfers were made at one time (Fellows v. Fellows, supra), or at different times, widely distant from one another. (Reed v. Stryker, supra.) The same rule applies to any other case in which one party fraudulently transfers property be- longing to another, or creates a cloud upon the title of his principal, in favor of several distinct persons. (N. Y. k&Newl Haven R. R. Co. v. Schuyler, 17 N. Y. 592; 7 Abb. 41; rev'g S. C. 1 Abb. 417; and overruling in effect Lexington &c. B. R. Co. v. Goodmian, sp. t., 5 Abb. 493; 25 Barb. 469; 15 How. 85.) Injuries of various kinds, whether to person or pro- perty, occasioned by a single act of negligence on the part of the defendant, constitute but one cause of action (Howe v. Peckhiam, sp. t., 10 Barb. 656; 6 How. 229), and the same is doubtless true of an act of violence. A com- plaint showing that a tenant has committed acts of waste, and threatens to commit more, and praying for compen- sation for waste already committed, as well as for an injunction against further waste, contains but one cause of action. (Rodgers v. Rodgers, 11 Barb. 595.) As to the indivisibility of causes of action, see the next article of this chapter.,ART. 2.-Indivisibility of causes of action. A single wrongful act, or the breach of a single con- tract, creates but one cause of action, which is indivisible in its nature. (Semble, Secor v. Sturgis, 16 N. Y. 548, 558.) Such a cause of action cannot be split up, so as to found several actions thereon (Coggins v. Buliwinkle, 1 E. D. Smith, 434; Bendernagle v. Cocks, 19 Wend. 207; Willard v. Sperry, 16 Johns. 121; Smith v. Jones, 15 id. 229), and,* Reversing S. 0. below, 6 Abb. 109.,59
Indivisibility of cause3 of action. Illustrations. therefore an action for part of such a claim is a bar to an action for (lb.; Waterblury v. Graha1m, 4 Sands. 220; Miller v. Covert, 1 Wend. 487; Farrington v. Payne, 15 Johns. 432), counterclaim, or set off of (Miller v. Covert, supra) the residue.,Where a single contract stipulates for the performance of several acts at various times, a separate action may be maintained on each successive breach (Beach v. Crain, 2 N. Y. [2 Corns.] 86; aff'g S. C., 2 Barb. 120; Sttyve- sant v. Mayor of N. Y., 11 Paige, 414; see Secor v. Stur- gis, 16 N. Y. 548), provided no other breach of the same contract has occurred before the commencement of such action (ib.); for all breaches of a single contract, which occur prior to the commencement of an action on any of them, are merged into a single and indivisible cause of action. (Coggins v. Blwiinkle, 1 E. D. Smith, 434; Ben- dernagle v. Cocks, 19 Wend. 207.) And when perform- ance of a contract intended to be continuing in its nature has become impossible for the future, only one action can be brought upon it for all breaches, pasr or future. (Fish v. Polley, 6 Hill, 54; as explained in Crain v. Beach, 2 Barb. 120.),Where a running account is kept, the rule is, that if the circumstances show that the dealing between the parties were looked upon by them as continuous, and not isolated, so that one item, if not paid, should be added to another, the whole is to be considered one indivisible cause of action.* (Bonysey v. Wordsworth, 1I 0. B. 334; Wood v. Perry, 3 Exch. 445; Re Aykroyd, 1 id. 493.),Illustrations.]-Where a bed and quilts were taken to- gether, it was held that an action for the quilts was a bar to the subsequent action for the bed. (Farrington v. Payne,,* Guernsey v. Carver (8 Wend. 492), lays down a broader rule, but can. 'be sustained only on. this ground. (See Secor v. Surgis, 16 N. Y. 548.) 60
Indivisibility of causes of action Election between. 15 Johns. 432.) WhVere three barrels of ashes were 'sold at one time, an action for the price of one barrel was held a bar to an action for the price of the others. (Smtith v. Jonles, 15 Johns. 229.),Where one parcel of goods was bought on credit in September, and another parcel for cash in November, it was held that a separate action might be brought for each parcel, after both had been purchased. (Staples v. Good- ric7l, 21 Barb. 317.),Where the same parties carried on two different kinds of business at separate places, keeping the accounts of each business entirely distinct, it was held that they might bring separate actions against the same defendant for debts arising out of transactions in the different lines of business. (Secor v. Stargis, 16 N. Y. 548; aff'g S. ., 2 Abb. 69.) Splitting demand by consent.]-A demand otherwise in- divisible may of course be divided by the debtor's con- sent. (Cornell v. Cook, 7 Cow. 310.) And by giving a new obligation for a portion of the debt, the debtor in effect consents to a division thereof, and one action may be brought upon the new obligation and another upon the balance of the original debt. (Seco)rv. Stltrgis, 16 N. . 548.) Splitting byassignmen t.]-A single claim may be assigned in parts to different persons, and any one of them may sue for his own share. (Field v. Mayor of N. Y., 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 179.) But he must make all the other assignees parties to the action, either as plaintiffs or defendants. (Cook v. Genesee Ins. Co., sp. t., 8 How. 514.),ART. 3.-Election between different causes of action. Although the plaintiff cannot, by changing the form of his action, vary the legal rights of the defendant. (('c((u)bell v. Perkins, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 439), yet a defend- ant may be liable in several different forms of action at,61
Election between different causes of action. Waiving contract. the election of the plaintiff, and very important results may depend upon the discretion with which such power of election is exercised.,Thus it may sometimes be necessary to waive a tort and sue in contract, in order to sustain an action against the estate of a deceased person. (See Doedt v. Wiswall, 15 How. 128.),On the other hand, by waiving a contract and suing in tort, more efficient remedies may sometimes be ob- tained, and persons incompetent to bind themselves by contract may be made liable for their wrongful acts. Il- lustrations of this principle will be given hereafter.,Waiving contract and siing in tort.] Whenever the plaintiff has a right to rescind a contract entered into by him, he may do so by suing for anything obtained from him on the faith of such contract, in an action of tort.,Thus one who is fraudulently induced to sell goods may rescind the sale, and may sue for the possession of the goods (Nichols v. 1llMichael, 23 N. Y. 264; Morris v. Rieford, 18 N. Y. 552; IWheaton v. Baker, 14 Barb. 594; HIammond v. Hudson River Machine Co., 20 id. 493; Cary v. Ilotailing, 1 Hill, 311), or for their value as goods wrongfully converted to the defendant's use (Ash v. Putt nam, 1 Hill, 302), or for damages generally upon the deceit. (Hawkins v. Appleby, 2 Sands. 421.),Where an infant purchases goods under a false repre- sentation that he is of age, the seller may recover the pos- session of the goods (Badger v. Phinney, 15 Mass. 359); and perhaps he might sue for the deceit. (People v. Ken- dall, 25 Wend. 399.) And if an infant hires the use of a chattel for a specific purpose, and uses it for an entirely different purpose, he may be sued for a conversion. (Fislt v. Ferris, 5 Ducr, 49; Homer v. Thwaing, 3 Pick. 492.) So if he willfully iLiures it he is liable. (Canmpbell v. Stakes, 2 Wend. 137.) So vhere he is employed to carry or keep goods, and converts them to his own use, he is liable. 62
Election between different causes of action. Waiving tort. (passe v. Smith, 6 Cranch, 230.) In all these cases it will be perceived that an action upon the breach of contract would lie against a person of full age, but not against an infant, so that the only remedy is on the tort.,If, however, the substantial basis of the action is in contract, the plaintiff cannot, by a mere change in the form of the action, make a defendant liable, who would not be liable in an action upon the contract. (Carnpbell v. Perkins, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 440; see People v. Kendall, 25 TWnd. 399; Jennings v. Randall, 8 T. R. 335.) Waiving tort, and suing on contract.]-WYhen one has wrongfully obtained the property of another, and applied it to his own use, the latter may waive the tort, and claim upon an implied contract. Thus where money has been fraudulently btained, the person defrauded may sue in contract, as foL money re- ceived to his use. (Byxbie v. Wood, 24 N. Y. 607; aff'g SIel- don v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 267.) And where goods have been fraudulently obtained, the owner may recover their value in an action for goods sold and delivered. (Kayser v. Sichel, 34 Barb. 84; Roth v. Palmer, 27 Barb. 652; Camp v. Pul- rer, 5 id. 91; Hinds v. Tweddle, sp. t., 7 How. 278; Hill v. Davis, 3 N. H. 384; Hill v. Jerrott, 3 Taunt. 274; see Chambers v. Lewis, sp. t., 10 Abb. 206; Osborn v. Bell, 5 Denio, 370; Berly v. Taylor, 5 Hill, 577, 583; C nmmings v. Yorce, 3 id. 282; Putnam v. Wise, 1 id. 234, 240; Butts v. Collins, 13 Wend. 154; Foster v. Stewart, 3 Mau. & Sel., 191; Lightly v. Clouston, 1 Taunt. 112.*) The same * In HIenry v. Marvin (3 E. D. Smith, 71), this question was considered doubtful. In other cases (AfcKnight v. Dunlop, 4 Barb. 36; Jones v. Hoar, 5 Pick. 285; Willett v. Willett, 3 Watts, 277; Morrison v. Rogers, 2 Scamm. 319; Bennett v.

Electiou betweeu different causes of action. Bntween different contracts. rule has been applied to cases in which property was taken without even the nominal consent of the owner (lill v. Davis, 3 N. H. 384); and obviously no distinction can be made between the two cases. If the goods have been sold, the owner may, at his option, recover the pur- chase money from the person who took them, in an action for money received to his use* (Young v. 1Marshall, 8 Bing. 43; see MleKnight v. Dun1lop, 4 Barb. 36, 42; Jones v. Hoare, 5 Pick. 285; Willett v. Willett, 3 Watts, 277); but of course, in such an action, the plaintiff can recover no more than the amount actually received by the de- fendant.,If an apprentice is enticed from his master and employed by another person, the master may, instead of suing for general damages, sue such person on an implied contract to pay the value of the apprentice's services. (Foster v. Stewart, 3 Man. & Sel. 191, 201; Lii7htly v. Clouston, 1 Taunt. 112.),An action against a common carrier for injuries caused by his negligence as such may be brought either in tort or contract. (Docdt v. lViswall, 15 How. 128.),If the plaintiff elects to sue on contract, the complaint must not contain allegations bearing only upon the tort. (Sellar v. Sage, sp. t., 12 How. 531.),Election betwieen different contracts.]-- When a special contract has been fully executed on the part of the plain- tiff, so as to leave a simple debt or duty owing to him from lie defendant, he may sue upon the implied promise which the law raises for payment or performance on the * In CaTpenter v. Stillwell (sp. t., 3 Abb. 459), it was held that the profits of land, tortiously obtained, could not be recovered in such an action. But this case was reversed at general term, though we do not know on what ground. (Compare Lightly v. Clouston, 1 Taunt. 114; Cummings v. Ioyes, 10 Mass. 433.) 64
Election between different causes of action. Between different contracts. part of tle defendant, and put the special contract in evidence. (Mosset v. Sackett, 18 N. Y. 522; Farron v. Sherwood, 17 id. 227; Linnegar v. Hodd, 5 C. B. 439; Stone v. Rogers, 2 Mees. & W. 418.) But this can only be done when the contract has been full'- performed (Ecans v. Harris, 19 Barb. 416; Outwater v. 1)o7de, 7 Cow. 85), unless full performance has been pre- vented by tle act of God (Volfe v. Howes, 20 N. Y. 197; aff'g S. C. 24 Barb. 174), or of the state (see Jones v. Judd, 4N. Y. [4 Comst.] 412), or of the defendant. (Liinninzgdale v.Livingston, 10 Johns. 36; see Jones v. Judd, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 412; Raymond v. Bearnard, 12 Johns. 274.) Even in these cases it has been leld that if the special contract is lundler seal it must be specially pleaded (FYoung v. Preston, 4 Cranch, 239; see TenL Eyck v. Holughtailing, 12 How. 529), except in an action for use and occupation (Ten Eyck v. Ioltghtailing, supra), but under the Code we do not believe that this rule is in force. The only restriction which can be placed upon the adoption of a general form of pleading upon a sealed instrument, is in the exclusion of evidence not within the scope of the coiiipl)inlt. And a general averment of liability may well be sustained by proof of a corresponding obligation under seal. It was formerly held that a complaint on an implied promise could not be sustained by e '!lence of a policy of insurance (Marine Ins. Co. v. YolUl, 1 Cranch, 332), nor of a charter )party, with special conditions (Atty v. Parish, 4 Bos. & Ptul., 104), nor of a justice's judgment (JaXles v. Henry, 16 Johns. 233); and as it would be diffi- cult to frame a trutltfiul complaint upon such obligations without setting forth their provisions specially, these decisions have still much weight. The holder of a bond and mortgage for the same debt mayproceed upon either, at his option. (Roosevelt v. Car- giter, 28 Barb. 426; see Jackson v. Hull, 10 Johns. 481.),9,__,65
Where a debtor's own note has been received in pay- ment, the creditor, may, upon its being dishonored, sue either upon the note or the original debt. (Cole v. Sackett, 1 Hill, 516; see Spencer v. Ballot, 18 N. Y. 331; Hill v. Beebe, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 562.),When a debt, barred by the statute of limitations, is revived by a new promise, the creditor may sue upon either the original debt or the new promise. (See Essel- styn v. Weeks, 12 N. Y. [2. Kern.] 635; 2 Abb. 272.) But when the debt has been extinguisthed, as by a release under seal (Stearns v. 'Tpplin, 5 Duer, 294, 303), or a dis- charge in insolvency (see ib.; Delpy v. Swart, 3 Wend. 135), the action must be brought on the new promise.,So where a new contract has been substituted for an old one, or where a contract has been modified, the new or modified contract must be sued upon. (Senmble, llHoles v. Holomes, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 525.),Where a plaintiff has parted with anything under a contract which hle has a right to rescind, he may sue upon any implied contract which the law would have raised from the acts of the parties in the absence of any express contract. (Kayser v. Sictel, 34 Barb. 84; Roth7 v. Palmer, 27 Barb. 652.) Thus, if the plaintiff has been induced by fraud to sell and deliver goods on credit, lie may rescind the coltract, and sue at once for the cash value of the goods. (1 b.; Willson v. Force, 6 Johns. 110.) Of course, in such case, le recovers the value, and not the stipulated price of the goods. So where one has been induced by fraud to make an exchange of goods, he may recover the value of the goods delivered by him, as on an implied contract, upon offering to restore all that he received on the exchange. (Pierce v. Drake, 15 Johns. 475.),Election betwCeen different remiedies in tort.]-When a chattel is wrongfully taken from the owner, he may sue for its possession, or for damages for its conversion. (See 66,CAUSES OF ACTION.

Appleby, 2 Sands. 421.) Election concltsive.]-A plaintiff, having made his elec- tion, is conclusively bound thereby, and cannot resort to two remedies for the same injury, either concurrently or successively. Especially is this the case where the plaintiff has elected to treat a contract as rescinded, and to sue in tort, or rice versa. Thus lie cannot, after suing for the possession of goods obtained from him by fraud, sue for the price of the same goods. (Morris v. IRexford, 18 N. Y. 552.) So, on the other hand, if he has with knowledge of the fraud, sued for the contract price, and recovered judgment, he cannot claim the property. (Lloyd v. Brew2s- ter, 4 Paige, 537.) And where, an agent having misap- plied money entrusted to him, the principal recovers judgment for the amount of such money, he cannot after- wards claim the property purchased therewith. (Bank of Beloit v. Beale, sp. t., 11 Abb. 375; 20 How. 331.) So where a principal disaffirins a sale made by his agent, for fraud on the part of the purchaser, and sues the purchaser for the property, he cannot sue his agent for damages on account of such sale having been made at too low a price. (Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327, 340.),ART. 4.-Uniting causes of action. The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint several causes of action, whether they are such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all arise out of, 1.

(Code, Â§ 167.*),This section is remedial and beneficial, and should be liberally construed. (Gridley v. Gridley, 24 N. Y. 136.) No causes of action can however be joined, except such as are allowed by this section to be united. (Dewey v. Ward, 12 How. 419.),Legal and equitable relief.]-Legal and equitable causes of action may be united in one complaint, subject to the same rules as if the claims so united all belonged to one of those classes alone. (Code, Â§ 167; see Gridley v. Grid- ley, 24 N. Y. 136; Phillips v. Gorham, 17 N. Y. 270; Getty v. Hudson, River R. R. Co., sp. t., 6 How. 269.) The cases which conflict with this rule (Lattin v.

Uniting causes of action. Claims arising out of one transaction. Code. (N . . & New Haven 1. R. Co. v. Schuyler, 17 N. y. 592; 7 Abb. 41.) By "transaction," is here meant the entire proceeding out of which the controversy arose (Robinson v. Flint, sp. t., 16 How. 240; 7 Abb. 393, n.; Brewer v. Temple, sp. t., 15 How. 286; see Adams v. Bissell, 28 Barb. 382); as, where the action is founded upon breach of contract, all that occurred in relation to the'negotiation and perform- ance of the contract, whether in the way of contract or wrongful act (Robinson v. Flint, supra; Adams v. Bissell, supra; see Badger v. Benedict, 1 Hilt. 414; 4 Abb. 176), or, in an action upon an act of violence, all the acts of the defendant in committing the injury. (Brewer v. Temple, supra.) A more restricted interpretation was given to this clause in one case (Sweet v. Ingerson, 12 How. 331), and followed subsequently on the mere ground of prece- dent (Springsteed v. Lawson, 14 Abb. 328; 23 How. 302), but this was confessedly done for the purpose of giving a strict construction to Â§ 167, which should, on the con- trary, as we have seen, be liberally construed. We think, therefore, that these cases are not to be followed. They are clearly inconsistent with the cases previously cited. Under this clause the following causes of action, among others, may be united: A claim by a purchaser of land under a full warranty deed, to have a prior mortgagee satisfy the mortgage of record, on payment of such sum as may be found due, with a claim against the vendor for payment of the amount so found due. (Wandle v. Turney, 5 Duer, 661.) A claim against a carrier for the value of goods converted by him to his own use, with a claim for freight money paid to him on the same goods under the belief that he had delivered them. (Adams v. Bis-' sfd, 28 Barb. 382.) Claims against a constable for neglect- ing to return an execution, andi for withholding money collected by him thereon. (Moore v. Smith, sp. t., 10 How. 361.)

Claims for damages upon a false representation by which the plaintiffs were induced to enter into a contract, and also upon a breach of such contract. (Robinson v. Flint, sp. t., 16 How. 240; 7 Abb. 393 nt.) The cases to the contrary, (Sweet v. Ingerson, 12 How. o31; followed, 'Springsteed v. Lawson, 14 Abb. 328; 23 How. 302), are, we think. erroneously decided.,Claims on contract.] -A judgment is an implied con- tract (Bank of British N. America v. Suydaim, sp. t., 6 How. 379; see People v. Bennett, 6 Abb. 343); and several judgmeinis may therefore be sued upon in one action (Bank of Brit. N. America v. Suydam, supra); and a claim upon a judgment may be joined with a claim upon express contract. (Union Cotton 7Manufactory v. Lobdell, 13 Johns. 462.),Injuries to character.]-Mlalicious prosecution, being an injury to the character (Martin v. Mattison, sp. t., 8 Abb. 3; Watson v. Hazzard, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 218), may be joined with libel and slander as causes of action. (Ib.),Claims against a trustee.] -By " trustee " is here meant not only those who are technically so called, but also exe cutors, administrators, &c. (See Landau v. Levy, sp. t., 1 Abb. 376.),A cause of action against a trustee, as such, cannot (it has been held), be united with one against him in his individual capacity (M'Mahon v. Allen, 3 Abb. 89; 1 Hilt. 103; Landau v. Levy, sp. t., -1 Abb. 376; Latting v. Lat- ting, 4 Sands. Ch. 31), norwith one against another person who is not a co-trustee. (Alger v. Scoville, 6 How. 131.) These propositions are, however, to broad. Section 167 of the Code was amended, in 1852, for the express pur pose of nullifying the doctrine maintained in Alger v. 70
Â·-Ci Uniting causes of aotion. Claims against trustee. Must affect all parties. Scoville (supra). In Reed v. Strjker (Court of Appeals, 12 Abb. 47), a claim against a trustee was united with claims against other persons. Where the plaintiff has an option to sue the defendant either as an individual or as trustee, he may join such a claim with one in which he has no such option. Thus, where executors renewed a lease for the benefit of the estate, it was held that the landlord could, in one action, she them for arrears due from the testator, as well as* for rent due under the renewed lease. (Pugsley v, Aicin, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 494; rev'g S. 0., 14 Barb. 114.),Claims must affect all parties.]-The causes of action united in one complaint must affect all the parties to the action (Code, Â§ 167), unless the action is brought for the foreclosure of a mortgage (Id.*); and it is therefore not allowable to join a claim against all the defendants with a claim for which part of them only are liable (Barnes v. Smith, 16 Abb. 420; .Malone v. Stillwell, 15 id. 421; Welles v. Jewett, sp. t., 11 How. 242; Tonmplins v. White, sp. t., 8 How. 520; see Rodgers v. Rodgers, 11 Barb. 595); and, of course, no distinct claims against the defendants sepa- rately can be united (Hess v. Buffalo &c. R. R. Co., 29 Barb. 391; Phalen v. Dingee, 4 E. D. Smith, 379; see Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 340), even though they are husband and wife. (Palen v. Lant, sp. t., 5, Bosw. 713; Malone v. Stilwell, 15 Abb. 421.) In Hess v. Buffalo &c. R. R. Co. (supra), it was held that where A. erected a nuisance, and transferred it to B., who continued it, an action could not be maintained against them both to- gether for the injury. We are strongly inclined to con- sider this a misapplication of the principle on which the decision was based. The case seems to us closely analo- gous to the Schuyler controversy, and to the other cases cited ante, p. 58. The injury was substantially single, *This clause was inserted in 1863. It is not easy to see its necessity.,71
and the plaintiff ought to be allowed to recover all his rights from the offending party as well as his transferee, in one action.,It is not necessary that all the parties should be effected equally. It is no objection to the joinder of actions that some of the parties have but a slight or contingent in- terest in some or all of the matters in controversy. (Yer. meule v. Beck, sp. t., 15 How. 333.),Claims requiring different places of trial.] -The actions joined must not require different places of trial (Code, Â§ 167), that is, they must not be such as are properly tri- able in different counties. The interpretation put upon this clause in House v. Cooper (sp. t., 30 Barb. 157; 16 How. 292), and Lattin v. McCarty (8 Abb. 225; 17 How. 239), construing it as forbidding the union of a claim triable by jury with one triable by the court, is wholly unwarranted. (See Phillips v. Gorlam, 17 N. Y. 270; New York Ice Co. v. Northwestern Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. Pr. 414; 21 How. 296.),What cannot be joined.] -Inconsistent claims cannot be joined (Lattin v. McCarty, 8 Abb. 225; 17 How. 239; Sweet v. Ingerson, 12 How. 331; Smith v. Hallock, sp. t., 8 How. 73; Linden v. Hepburn, 2 Sands. 668; 5 How. 188; see Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 340), though it will depend very much upon the form of the pleading, whether it is demurrable or not upon this ground. If the inconsistency is only in the demand of relief, that is not a ground for demurrer. The better plan, in general, is to move at the trial that the plaintiff elect upon which claim he will proceed.*,A claim for the forfeiture of an estate on the breach of a condition cannot be united with a claim for an,* This course was pursued in Underhll v.

Abbott, sp. t.. 12 How. 340), nor with a claim for damages for the breach. (Underhill v. Saratoga &c. B. R. Co., 20 Barb. 455.) A claim by the plaintiff in his own right cannot be joined with a claim by him as executor, or in any other representative character (Lucas v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 21 Barb. 245; Hall v. Fisher, 20 Barb. 442; see Warwick v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 28 Barb. 210; 7 Abb. 265; 16 How. 357), though where the plaintiff has a common interest in a single subject of action, both in his representative and individual capacities, he may bring one action to settle the entire controversy. (Armstrong v. Hall, sp. t., 17 How. 76.) A principal and surety cannot be sued together (P/halon v. Dingee, 4 E. D. Smith, 379; Allen v. Fosgate, sp. t., 11 How. 218; De Bidder v. Schernerhornm, 10 Barb. 638), unless they have entered into one joint contract. (Carman v. Plass, 23 N. Y. 286.) An action for the possession of land cannot be joined with an action for injuries thereto (Hotchkiss v. Auburn & Rochester R. R., 36 Barb. 600; Budd v. Binglain, 18 Barb. 496; Hulce v. Towmson, sp. t., 9 How. 113), though damages for the detention may be recovered in an action for land (Code, Â§ 167), including an action for dower. (Fan Name v. Van Name, 23 How. 247.) An action for partition cannot be united with a cred- itor's action (Dewey v. Ward, 12 How. 419), nor an action on contract with an action on a wrongful act (Hitnter v. Powell, 15 How. 221; Coster v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., 3 Abb. 332; Colwell v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., sp. t., 9 How. 311; Tompkins v. White, 8 How. 520), unless both causes of action arise out of one transaction, or transactions connected with the same subject of action. (1Robinson v.

Uniting causes of action. Classification of actions. A cause of action for divorce from the bonds of matri- mony cannot be united with one for divorce from bed and board only. (M'Intoslt v. M'Intosh, sp. t., 12 How. 289; Smith v. Smith, 4 Paige, 92; Johnson v. Johnson, 6 Johns. Ch. 163.) Actions for accounting under the wills of different testators, not affecting exclusively the same property or parties, cannot be united. (Viall v. Mott, 37 Barb. 208.),ART. 5.-Classification of actions. Although, under the Code, the classification of actions is not a matter of su'h importance as under the old practice, yet as in 'he absence of any other system, the profession are in danger of falling back upon the com- mon law division and nomenclature of actions, which are wholly unsuited to actions under the Code, we have thought it desirable to attempt a new classification, in accordance with the spirit of the new practice.,Actions must plainly be classified, primarily, according to the relief sought (see Code, Â§ 129, 167; Phillips v. Gor- hamn, 17 N. Y. 274; Maxwell v. Farnam, sp. t., 7 How. 236; Dows v. Green, sp. t., 3 How. 377), but, subordi- nately, the causes of action are to be taken into account.,The classification of actions which appears to us to be most logical and convenient is as follows:,FIRST Actions for ordinary relief:,I. For debt (i. e., liquidated damages):,1. On actual contract; 2. On contract, created by operation of law. II. For damages:,1. On breach of contract; 2. On wrongs independent of contract;,a. To property; b. To the person; c. To character. 74
Classification of actions. Nomenclature of actions.,Im. For specific property:,1. For land; 2. For chattels. SECOND: Actions for special relief:,I. Concerning real property; II. Concerning personal property; III. Concerning personal rights; IV. Concerning public office. Actions for special relief are mainly, but not exclu- sively, such as were formerly cognizable only in a court of equity. The principal exceptions to the general rule are actions for the determination of claims to real pro- perty, for forfeiture on account of waste, for abatement of a nuisance (though the equitable action for the same purpose was and is the most convenient), for public office, and for the dissolution of a corporation. Nomenclature of actions.]-It is desirable to avoid the use of the old names of actions, so far as they were merely technical, because their continued use creates a false impression that the new forms of action are governed by the old rules. Thus the present action for the possession of personal property should be called an "action for chattels," and not "replevin," because its course of proceeding is essentially different from a replevin suit. So the old action of ejectment is better styled "an action for land." An action for damages upon the conversion of personal property should be called an "action for conversion," and not " trover," nor " trespass de bonis," for it certainly is not trover, and the other name is palpably unsuitable. Some confusion has already been created by an applica- tion of the strict rules of trover to this action, whereas it is more analogous to trespass de bonis. It is absurd to call an action on an implied promise " assumpsit," when the cardinal feature of that action, viz., the averment of,75
Classification of actions. What a complaint must contain. a fictitious promise, is abolished. (See ante, p. 8; Farron v. Sherwood, 17 N. Y. 227,230.) Such an action is now an action for debt, and though not governed by the strict rules of the common law action of debt, nevertheless approximates more closely to that than to the action of assumpsit, in respect of form.,CHAPTER XLII.

Stevens, sp. t., 14 How. 70; Van Namee v. Peoble, sp. t., 9 How. 198.) Neverthe- less, the omission is an error, and not to be approved.,Name of the county.]-The complaint must specify the name of the county in which the trial is to be had. (Code, Â§ 142.) A complaint omitting to do so is irregular (Hotchkiss v. Crocker, sp. t., 15 How. 336; Davisor v. Powell, sp. t., 13 How. 287; Merrill v. Grinnell, sp. t., 10 How. 31), and will be set aside on motion. (lb.) Nor is the defect cured by a county being named in the sum- mons (Hotckhiss v. Crocker, supra; Merrill v. Grinnel, supra), for the complaint is not governed by the summons in this respect at all (see ib.), though in such case an amendment should be allowed on easy terms. (See Davi- son v. Powell, supra.),The plaintiff's intention to have the cause tried in the county named, need not be stated. It is sufficiently indicated by naming the county in the margin, or else- where in the title of the cause. (Slate v. Post, 9 Johns. 31; Sutton v. Penn, 2 W. Bl. 847; Benton v. Brown, 1 Mo. 393.),In actions brought in a local court, such as the New York Common Pleas or Superior Court, the Brooklyn City Court, &c., which must of necessity be tried in the county in which such court is situated, the statement of :a county in the complaint is of no importance, because the defendant cannot fail to know where the trial will be had.

The title. Names of the parties. Agreement with summon*. This means the names of an the parties. (See, on a similar expression, Orcutt v. Cahill. 24 N.Y. 578.) And though the complaint will be sufcient if the names are stated in its body, instead of in the title (Hill v. Thacter, sp. t., 3 How. 407), yet that is not, by any means, the proper prac- ti e. (Ib.; Meeke v. Ozxade, 1 Bos. & Pul. N. R. 289.),The christian names of the parties should be fully set forth. For those are their only real names, surnames not being recognized by the law. (Snook's case, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 566.) The names ought not to be given by mere initials, without some excuse. The middle name is of no impor- tance, and may be stated by its initial. Indeed its entire omission could not, we suppose, be objected to.,After the parties have been once named, it is sufficient to refer to them as " the plaintiff" and "the defendant" (Davison v. Savage, 6 Taunt. 121; Stevenson v. Hunter, id. 406); and it is indeed improper to repeat the names every time they are referred to (Meeke v. Oxiade, 1 Bos. & Pul. N. R. 289), unless there is but one person plain- tiff or defendant, in which case it is optional with the pleader. Where a single person is referred to, especially if one of several plaintiffs or defendants is to be specified for any purpose, it is sufficient to mention him by his 'christian name, if no other party to the action bears the same name,-as for instance, a defendant, on his name being mentioned in the body of the complaint, may be called "the said James," or otherwise, as the case may be. (Huttchins v. Gilbie, 2 Chitt. Rep. 335.),ART. 3.-Agrementet with summons. As to the parties.]-The complaint must agree with the summons in the names of the parties (Follower v. Laugilin, 12 Abb. 105; Allen v. Allen, sp. t., 14 How. 248; Elliott v. Hart, sp. t., 7 How. 25; Willard v. Missani, 1 Cow. 37; Henderson v. Ballantine, 4 Cow. 549), though it may omit the names of any of the persons named as defend-,79
Agreement with summons. As to the county of trial. ants in the summons (Travis v. Tobias, sp. t., 7 How. 90); as was the rule before the Code, where the action was commenced by non-bailable process (Montgomery v. Has. broluck, 3 Johns. 538; Bowles v. Bilton, 2 Cr. & Jer. 474; Holland v. Johnson, 4 T. R. 605); and though the rule was otherwise in case bailable process was used (Bell v. Carrell, 1 Cow. 193; Roosevelt v. Soulden, 16 Johns. 44), yet this distinction is obsolete, inasmuch as all actions are now commenced by a summons, which can never be made a warrant of arrest, as the capias was under the old prac- tice.,Probably a complaint naming fewer plaintiffs than the summons would be irregular, unless it alleged the death or transfer of interest of the plaintiffs omitted. And a complaint against more defendants than are named in the summons is irregular. (Follower v. Laughlin, 12 Abb. 105.),It has been held (Blanchard v. Strait, sp. t., 8 How. 83) that under the Code, as was the rule before (Canning v. Davis, 4 Burr. 2417; see Ashwuorth v. Ryal, 1 B. & Ad. 20; Douglas v. Irlam, 8 T. R. 416), if the summons described the plaintiff as suing in a special capacity, e. g., as executor, administrator, &c., the complaint must con- form thereto, and state a cause of action accruing to the plaintiff in that capacity. But we doubt the soundness of this rule. For it was settled, before the Code, that a declaration as executor, &c., was regular, notwithstand- ing the original writ was in the plaintiff's name without any such addition (Knowles v. Johnson, 2 Dowl. P. 0. 653; Ilsley v. Ilsley, 2 Cr. & Jer. 330; Ashworth v. Ryal, 1 B. & Ad. 20; see Manesty v. Stevens, 9 Bing. 400), and it is difficult to see any real ground for distinguishing the two cases. (Compare Douglas v. Irlam, 8 T. R. 416, with Ashworth v. Ryal, 1 B. & Ad. 20.),As to the county of trial.] -The complaint is not bound to name the same county as the place of trial, which is

As to the court.] -We presume that the complaint must conform to the summons in respect to the name of the' court. - As to the nature of the action.] -The nature of the cause of action stated in the complaint must conform to that indicated by the summons, and if it does not, the complaint, and not the summons, will be set aside. (Tuttle v. Smith, 6 Abb. 829; 14 How. 395; Shafer v. Humlphrey, sp. t., 15 How. 564; Davis v. Bates, sp. t., 6 Abb. 315; Boington v. Laphiam, sp. t., 14 How. 360; Johnson v. Paul, sp. t., id. 454; Ridder v. Whitlo7c, sp. t., 12 How. 208; overruling Cemetery of Hyde Park v. Teller, sp. t., 8 low. 504; Yoorhees v. SceA.eld, sp. t., 7 How. 51.) The rule is Mae same, even when the complaint is served with the summons, inasmuch as the service of the latter is the commencement of the action, and the service of the com- plaint is, in a legal point of view, a subsequent step. (Tut- tle v. Smith, Ridder v. Whitlock, supra.) And a general appearance by the defendant does not waive the defect (Tuttle v. Smith, 6 Abb. 329; 14 How. 395; Shafer v. Humphrey, sp. t., 15 How. 564*), though an answer (Chambers v. Lewis, 11 Abb. 110; Hudson v. Nicholson, 5 Mees. & W. 446), or a demurrer does. (See Campbell v. Wright, 21 How. 9.) * Overruling Baxter v. Arnold (sp. t., 9 How. 445); Hewitt v. Howdt (sp. t., 8 How. 346); Webb v. Mott (sp. t., 6 How. 439).,11,81
General rules. CHAPTER XLIII. COMPLAINTS BY OR AGAINST PERSONS IN SPECIAL CAPACITIES.,ARTICLE 1. General rules.,2. Executors and administrators. 3. Receivers. 4. Guardians, committees, &c. 5. Corporations. 6. Officers of associations. ART. 1.- General rules. Whenever the plaintiff complains in the right of another, or sues the defendant as the representative of another, the fact that he does so sue must appear by the complaint, or the action will be taken to be between the respective parties in their own rights and individual capacities; and the facts which give him the right so to sue must also appear, or the complaint will be radically defective.,For this purpose it is indispensable that the complaint should not only mention the fact of the special capacity possessed by the party, but must also show that he sues or is sued in that capacity (Henshall v. Roberts, 5 East, 150; see Merrtt v. Seaman, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168.) There- fore a complaint by an executor or other trustee as such must not only describe the plaintiff as such, but must also aver that he sues as such. (Ib.) Thus a complaint entitled "A. B., executor of," &c., is a complaint by A. B. in his own right merely (ib.), and this, no matter how many times the phrase may be repeated in the body of the complaint (Henshall v. Roberts, 5 East. 150), whereas, if entitled " A. B., as executor," &c., it is a complaint in his special character as such. (Snith v. Levinus, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 474.) The word " as " is essential for this purpose, and cannot be replaced by any other single word. It should therefore be invariably inserted in pleadings of this description. 82
Genral rules. Reruedy against defective allegations. After the party has been once sufficiently described "as executor" or "as president," &c. (as the case may be), it is not necessary to repeat the averment of his special character, but he may thereafter be called simply "ithe plaintiff" or " the defendant," and it will be under- stood that he is spoken of in his special capacity. (See i Stanley v. Chappell, 8 Cow. 235.),Plaintiff's special capacity.]-If the complaint does not aver some special capacity in which the plaintiff sues, the action will be regarded as being brought in his own right. (Sheldon v. oTy, 11 How. 11; Gould v. Glass, i9 Barb. 179; Ogdensburgh Bank v. Rensselaer, ( Jill, 240; see Murray v. Heuldriclson, sp. t., 6 Abb. 96; 1 Bosw. 635.) Defendant's special capacity.]-In like manner, if the defendant is sued in any special character, the fact must appear in the complaint (Holliday v. Fletcher, 2 Ld. Baym. 1510; Dean &c. of Bristol v. Guyse, 1 Saund. 112), though a very general allegation thereof is sufficient for all purposes. (Holliday v. Fletcher, supra.) Renedy against defective allegatiotns.]-The entire ab- sence of any averment of the capacity in which the plaintiff sues is a ground for demurrer, if the complaint is not sustainable in the plaintiff's own right. (Sheldon v. goy, 11 How. 11; Hiulbert v. Young, 13 How. 413.*) But a demurrer will not lie for the want of particu- larity or clearness in the averment of the fact. (Cook v. Conselyea, sp. t., 8 Abb. 475; Serd v. Coit, sp. t., 5 Abb. 481; see Smith v. Levinus, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 472.) Thus a complaint beginning "A. B. as supervisor" (executor, or otherwise), "complains" &c., is sufficient on demurrer * These cases must be restricted to the doctrine of the text, though it be that they lay down a broader rule.,83
General rules. Executors and administrators. (Smith v. Levinus, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 472); and so where the complaint'alleges that the plaintiff (suing as an off- cer or trustee appointed by a court) was duly appointed, without stating by what court. (Cook v. Conselyea; Serev. Coit, supra.*) The remedy for such defects is by motion to make more definite.,ART. 2.-Executors and administrators. Compslaints by executors, &c.]-An executor or adminis- trator must sue as such, in order to recover a debt due to the decedent in his lifetime (Sheldon v. Hay, 11 How. 11; Henshall v. Roberts, 5 East, 150; see Merritt v. Seamain, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168), and may sue as such for a debt which has become due to the estate since his appoint- ment (Eagle v. Fox, 28 Barb. 473; 8 Abb. 40), but he is not bound to do so. (Merritt v. Seaman, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168; Sheldon v. Hoy, 11 How. 11; Bright v. Currie, 5 Sands. 433; LIyon v. Mars7haU, 11 Barb. 241; Biddle v. Wilkins, 1 Peters, 692; Mowry v. Adams, 14 Mass. 327.) And though he chooses to do so, yet the allegations of his executorship will, if defective, be disregarded as surplusage. (Bright v. Carrie, 5 Sands. 433; Worden v. Worthington, 2 Barb. 370; see Merritt v. Seanan, 6 N.Y. [2 Seld.] 168; Sheldon v. Hoy, 11 How. 11.),In an action necessarily brought by an executor, &c., as such, the complaint must allege that letters testamen- tary or of administration (see Thomas v. Cameron, 16 Wend. 580) were duly granted to him (Code, Â§ 161; Wheeler v. Dakin, sp. t., 12 How. 537) by a surrogate of this state (Sheldon v. Hoy, 11 How. 11; Beach v. King, 17 Wend. 197; see MorreU v. Dickey, 1 Johns. Ch. 155; Fermilya v. Beatty, 6 Barb. 431), naming him or his county (see ib.; W7leeler v. Dakin, supra), and stating the time and place at which the letters were granted. * Daytmt v. Connah (sp. t., 18 How. 327), is to the contrary, but must be disregarded. 84
Executors and administrators. Receivers. Promises made to the decedent must not be stated as made to " the plaintiff" (Worden v. Worthington, 2 Barb. 368), and goods sold, or money lent by the decedent must not be pleaded as having been sold or lent " by the plaintiff." (Ib.),Complaints against executors, &c.]-Though an execu- tor or administrator who has not taken out letters in this state, cannot be sued here (Veriilya v. Beatty, 6 Barb. 429; Vaughan v. Northrop, 15 Peters, 1; Prine v. Deri- hurst, 4 Myl. & Cr. 7 ,; see, however, McNamTara v. Diwyer, 7 Paige, 239), it is not necessary to allege anything as to the mode of the defendant's appointment. (Holliday v. Fletcher, 2 Ld. Raym. 1510.) It is enough to aver that he is executori (ib.),ART. 3.-Receivers. Complaints by eeceivers.]-In an action brought by a receiver as such, the complaint must aver that he was duly appointed (Code, Â§ 161) by a court or judge, naming it or him (Dayton v. Clonnah, sp. t., 18 How. 327; see Bangs v. McInttosh, 23 Barb. 591; White v. Lowi, sp. t., 7 Barb. 204), and stating the time and place of appoint- ment (see ib.; Gillett v. Fairchild, 4 Denio, 80), and if security was required by the order of appointment, it is better to allege that it has been filed as required. (See Gillett v. Fairchild, 4 Denio, 80.) If it is necessary in any case to state the nature of the proceeding in which the plaintiff was appointed receiver (compare Stewart v. Beebe, sp. t., 28 Barb. 34; Gillett v. Fairchild, 4 Denio, 80), the objection cannot be raised by demurrer. (Stewart v. Beebe, supra.) Complaints against receivers.]-In a complaint against %receiver, it is sufficient to allege that he is receiver, and to show that he is sued as such.,85
86 COMPI.INTS BY OR AGAINST Guardians, committees, &c. Lunatics and drunkards. Corporations.,AIT. 4.-Guardians, comnmittees, &c. Complaints by infants.]-In an action brought by an infant, the complaint must allege that he is an infant (Stanley v. Chappell, 8' Cow. 235; Combers v. Watton, 1 Levinz, 224), and that the guardian by whom he appears was duly appointed (Code, Â§ 161) as a guardian for the purposes of the action, by a court named in the complaint, with the time and place of appointment. (See Hulbert v. Young, 13 How. 413; Stanley v. Cutppell, 8 Cow. 235.) And a complaint containing no averment of the guard- ian's appointment, and no allegations inconsistent with the idea of his being a mere general guardian, is bad on demurrer. (Hulbert v. Young, 13 How. 413.),The usual form of entitling a complaint by an infant, is "A. B., an infant, by 0. D., his guardian," the action being considered the infant's and not the guardian's. (Hill v. Thacter, sp. t., 3 How. 407.),Lunatics and drunlkards.]-The committee of a lunatic or drunkard may sue in his own name, on behalf of his ward, as trustee of an express trust. (Person v. Warren, sp. t., 14 Barb. 488.),His complaint must state the fact of his appointment as such committee, by a court of competent jurisdiction. (See Hall v. Taylor, sp. t., 8 How. 428.),It has been held that a complaint against the commit- tee of a lunatic must show how he was appointed (Hall v. Taylor, supra), but this is clearly erroneous. (See ante, p. 83.),ART. 5.Corporpations. A corporation must sue in its own name, and not in the names of its officers. (Buandy v. Birdsall, 29 Barb. 31.),Complaints nby domestic corporations.]--In an action brought by a corporation of this state, the complaint need not allege that it is a corporation. (Lctfayette .Is. Co.
Corporations. Pleading acts of corporations. v. Rogers, 3U Barb. 491; Shoe & Leather Bank v. Brown, sp. t., 9 Abb. 218; S1 How. 308; Bank of Waterville v. Beltser, sp. t., 13 How. 270; Metropolitan Bank v. Lord, 4 Duer, 630; 1 Abb. 185; Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Osgood, 1 Duer, 707; Dutchess Cotton Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 14 Johns. 238; see Kennedy v. Cotton, 28 Barb. 59.*) The same rule applies to corporations created by the laws of the United States. (United States Bank v. Haskins, 1 Johns. Cas. 132.),Coiplaints by foreign coreporations.]-A corporation created by the laws of another state, must, it has been recently held, allege in its complaint that it has been incorporated by or under a law of that state. (Connecticut Bank v. Smith, sp. t., 9 Abb. 168.),The New York Superior Court, however, hold to the contrary. (Holyoke Bank v. Haskins, 4 Sands. 675.),Complaints against corporations.]-A complaint in an action against a corporation need not allege that it is a corporation. (Lighte. v. Everett Fire Ins. Co., sp. t., 5 Bosw. 716; see Stoddard v. Onondaga Conference, 12 Barb. 573.) Even if this rule does not apply to foreign corporations, it is clearly not necessary that the complaint should show how the defendant was incorporated, for that is presump- tively best known to the defendant. Pleading acts of corporations.]-In pleading an act done by a domestic corporation, it is not necessary to allege that it is a corporation (Kennedy v. Cotton, 28 Barbl. 59), nor whether it is a domestic or foreign corporation (Y. Y. Floating Derrick Co. v. N. J. Ore Co., 3 Duer, 648), to show that it had power to do such an act (Mechanics' Banking Asso. v. Spring Valley Shot & Lead Co., 25 Barb. 419 ; Camden & Amrboy 1. B. Co. v. Remer, sp. t., 4 id. * Overruling Johnson v. Kemp, (sp. t, 11 How. 186.) t Reversing S. C., 13 How. 227.,_ __ __,87
Corporations. Associations. 127; Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v. Jauncey, sp. t., 1 id. 486; see Nelson v. Eaton, 16 Abb. 113), at any rate, if it is an act which presumptively such a corporation has power to do. (N. Y. Floating Derrick Co. v. N. Y. Ore Co., 3 Duer, 648.),ART. 6.- Oficers of associations. Banking associations.]-Banking associations, formed under the general banking law, may sue and be sued in the name of their presidents (Laws 1838, ch. 260), or in their own names like any other corporations. (East River Bank v. Judah, sp. t., 10 How. 136; Case v. Mechanics' Banking Asso., 1 Sands. 693; see Gillett v. Moody, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.] 486; People v. Assessors of Watertown, 1 Hill, 621.),Other associations.] Any company or association com- posed of not less than seven persons, having a joint or common interest in the subject of the action, may sue and be sued in the name of the president or treasurer for the time being. (Ante, i. 459.),In an action so brought, it seems to be necessary to allege that the number of the associates is seven or more (Tiffany v. Williams, sp. t., 10 Abb. 204; Tibbetts v. Blood, 21 Barb. 650), but it is not necessary to give their names. (Tibbetts v. Blood, supra.),General rules.]-Whenever this mode of sueing is adopted, the complaint must show that the plaintiff sues, or the defendant is sued, " as president" or "as treasurer." (Ogdensburgh Bank v. Van R~nsselaer, 6 Hill, 240; see Hunt v. Van .Alstyne, 25 Wend. 605.),The acts of the association must not be pleaded as the acts of the plaintiff. (Ogdensburgh Bank v. Fan Rensselaer, 6 Hill, 240; Delafield v. Kinney, 24 Wend. 345; but see contra, Root v. Price, sp. t., 22 How. 372.)

Averment of notice. 6. Conditions precedent. 6. Conditions concurrent. 7. Breach. 8. Damages. ART. 1.-Statement of consideration. When necessary.]-Except in the cases hereafter noted, every complaint upon a contract, whether implied or ex- press, oral or written, must aver the existence of a consid- eration for the contract. (Dolcher v. Fry, 37 Barb. 152; Spear v. Dotwning, 12 Abb. 437; 22 How. 30; 34 Barb. 522; Bniley v. Freenmn, 4 Johns. 280; Buriet v. Bisco, id. 235; to same effect, Seaman v. Seaman, 12 Wend. 381; Parker v. Crane, 6 id. 647; and see Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 430.) And the consideration as pleaded must be suffi- cient to sustain the contract. (Ross v. Sadgbeer, 21 Wend. 166.),When unnecessary.]-Where the nature of the contract alleged is such as to raise a presumption of a considera- tion, none need be averred. Thus no consideration need be stated in pleading a contract under seal (Bush v. Stevens, 24 Wend. 256), or a negotiable bill or note. (Tib- betts v. Blood, 21 Barb. 650; see Bank of Troy v. Topping, 9 Wend., 277; Goshen Turnpike Co. v. Hurtin, 9 Johns. 217; Hatch v. Trayes, 11 Ad. & El. 708; Coom0bs v. Ingram, 4 Dowl. & Ryl. 214.),How stated.]-The consideration should of course be stated with substantial truth, but the strict rules of the common law, which required the whole consideration to,12,89
Statement of consideration. Statement of the contract. be stated, and to be p: oved as laid, without regard to the importance of the omission or variance, are not applica- ble under the Code.,If the action is brought upon a written contract, signed by the defendant, containing an acknowledgment of con- sideration, and a copy thereof is set out in the complaint, that is a sufficient averment of consideration. (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425.),An executed consideration, that is, one which had been rendered before the promise sued upon was made, must be alleged to have been rendered at the defendant's re- quest (Spear v. Downing, 34 Barb. 522; 12 Abb. 437; 22 How. 30; Parker v. Crane, 6 Wend. 647; Chafflee v. Thomas, 7 Cow. 358; Comstock v. Smith, 7 Johns. 87; Livingston v. Rogers, 1 Cai. 583), unless it is made appa- rent that such consideration was not given or accepted as a mere gratuity, in which case the averment of request may be omitted. (Note to Fisher v. Pyne, 1 Man. & Gr. 266; see Victors v. Davis, 12 Mees. & W. 760; Doty v. Wilson, 14 Johns. 378; Hicks v. Burhans, 10 id. 243.) Thus, in an action for goods "sold" (Aconw v. American Mineral Co., sp. t., 11 How. 24), or money " lent" (Victors v. Davis, 12 Mees. & W. 760), it is not necessary to allege that the sale or loan was made at the defendant's request. And a subsequent adoption or ratification of an act done in the expectation of reimbursement is equivalent to a previous request. (Doty v. Wilson, 14 Johns. 378.),When the only consideration alleged for a promise on the part of the defendant is a promise by the plaintiff, it must appear that they were made simultaneously. (Liv- ingston v. Rogers, 1 Cai. 583; see Keep v. Goodrich, 12 Johns. 397.),ART. 2.-Statement of the contract. The contract upon which the action is founded should be stated truly, with all its conditions (Adams v. Mayor of N. Y., 4 Duer, 295), and qualifications (Metzner v. Bolton, 90
Statement of the contract. Express contracts. Implied contracts. 9 Exch. 518; Browne v. Knil, 2 Brod. & B. 395), though unintentional defects of statement are not attended with such serious consequences as was formerly the case.,An express contract may be set forth in its precise words (Fairbankcs v. Bloonfield, 2 Duer, 353; Moore v. Plymouth, 3 Barn. & Aid. 69; NeiwboroLgh v. Schroder, 7 C. B. 397), or according to its substantial effect. (Clarke v. Monell, 1 Man. & Gr. 841.) It is not necessary, now, to state a contract strictly accordingly to its legal effect (ante, p. 8), as it was before the Code, unless pleaded in its exact words; nor, indeed, is it allowable to plead the legal effect of an agreement, if it is not consistent with the literal truth. (Gasper v. Adams, 28 Barb. 441.),Where a contract contains several distinct covenants, it is unnecessary to state more than the one upon which the action is brought, and such as qualify it. (Williams v. Healey, 3 Denio, 363; Sandford v. Halsey, [Court of Errors,] 2 Denio, 253, 255; Scott v. Lieber, 2 Wend. 279; Henry v. Cleland, 14 Johns. 400; see Hood v. Inman, 4 Johns. Ch. 437; Handford v. Palmer, 2 Brod. & B. 359.),If a contract has been modified, it must be pleaded as modified (Baldwin v. Munn, 2 Wend. 399; Langwortliy v. Smith, id. 587 F'reeman v. Adams, 9 Johns. 115; Philips v. Rose, 8 id. 392); and if a new agreement is substituted, that must be pleaded (see Spencer v. Halstead, 1 Denio, 606), and that alone. (Ctesbrough v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., sp. t., 26 Barb. 9; 11 How. 557.) A mere exten- sion of time of performance is not, however, a modifica- tion essential to be pleaded, if constituting no part of the cause of action. (Crane v. Maynard, 12 Wend. 408.),In an action upon a contract implied by law, the facts from which the law implies such a contract must be alleged (Prentice v. Dyke, 6 Duer, 220), though the im- plied contract itself need not, and should not be expressly pleaded. (Farron v. S7ierwood, 17 N. Y. 227; and see, ante) . 8.),91
Averment of demand. Rules concerning.,ART. 3.-Averment of denuind. Whei necessary.]-Whenever the plaintiff is bound to demand performance of an act before bringing an action therefor, he must allege such demand in his complaint.,It is difficult to extract any well defined general rules from the decisions upon the necessity of a demand before suit, and it is not strictly within our province to under- take the task. Nevertheless, a few suggestions may be acceptable to pleaders, especially as there seems to be no satisfactory statement elsewhere of the principles gov- erning this question.,As we understand the rules which govern the subject of demand before suit in cases of contract, they are as follows:,1. Where a party has agreed to perform any act other than the mere payment of money, he is not bound to perform without a demand, unless a time and place are fixed for performance, or in some other way a contrary intention is manifested. (Boutwell v. O'Keefe, 32 Barb. 434; Moore v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 12 Barb. 156; Lutweller v. Linnell, id. 512; Lobdell v. Hopkins, 5 Cow. 516; Connelly v. Pierce, 7 Wend. 129; Bach v. Owen, 5 T. R. 409.),2. Where a party agrees to pay money, without say- ing anything about a demand, he is bound to pay with- out demand, unless a contrary intention is manifested. (Lake Ontario &c. Railroad v. Mason, 16 N. Y., 464; East River R. R. v. Rogers, 7 Bosw. 493; Gibbs v. Southanm, 5 Barn. & Ad. 911.),3. Where one agrees to pay money in satisfaction of his own debt, even "on demand," the commencement of an action is a sufficient demand. (Howland v. Ed- monds, 24 N. Y. 307; Fairchild v. Ogdensburgh &c. R. R. Co., 15 id. 337; Wemrnan v. Mohawk Ins. Co., 13 Wend. 267; Waters v. ha7net, 2 Q. B. 757; Pierce v. Fotlwrgill, 2 Bing. N. . 167; 2 Scott, 334; Norton v. Earmn, 2 Mees. 92
Averment of demand. Rules concerning. & W. 461; Rumbcll v. Ball, 10 Mod. 38.) But if the money is not payable until a certain time after demand, a demand must of course be made at that length of time before suit. (Thorpe v. Booth, 1 Ry. & Moo. 388; ap- proved, Howland v. Edinonds; Wenman v. Mohawk Ins. Co., supra.),4. Where one agrees to pay the debt of another, "on demand," a demand must be made before suit. (Nelson v. Bostwick, 5 Hill, 37; Douglass v. Rathibone, id. 143; Birks v. Trippet, 1 Saund. 33 b.; see Carter v. King, 3 Campb. 459.),5. Where one agrees in the alternative, to do a certain act, or pay a certain sum, a demand must be made before suit. (Birks v. Trippet, 1 Saund. 33 b.),6. Where one receives money or any other thing for the use of another, the latter must demand payment before suit (Reina v. Cross, 6 Cal. 31; see Phlelps v. Bost- wick, 22 Barb. 314; Halden or Walden v. Crafts, 4 E. D. Smith, 490; 2 Abb. 301; Baird v. WVallwr, 12 Barb. 298; Cooley v. Betts, 24 Wend. 203; Ferris v. Paris, 10 Johns. 285; Beardslee v. Ric7tardson, 11 id. 25; Brown v. Cook, 9 id. 361; Bushnell v. APCazley, 7 Cal. 422; Toplham v. Braddick, 1 Tpunt. 572), unless the former has agreed to pay over without waiting for a demand, or is bound by the usage of his business to do so (see Lillie v. Hoyt, 5 Hill, 394), or has, in violation of a duty resting upon him, con- cealed from the person entitled to such money the fact of its receipt (see Stacy v. Graham, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 497), or has obtained it from its owner in some illegal manner (Ruzckman v. Pitcher, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 413), or by a mistake on the part of the owner (Utica Bank v. Van Gieson, 18 Johns. 485) of which the receiver was aware (see Kelly.v. Solari, 9 Mees. & W. 58; or under a contract which he has rescinded. (Saucher v. Goodman. 29 Barb. 515.),7. sWhere an obligation is created solely by implication of law, no demand of performance is necessary. (See,93
Averment of demand. How to be pleaded. ' Averment of notice. Ruckman v. Pitcher, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 413; Moss v. Shannon, 1 Hilt. 175.),A demand is waived by a positive refusal to perform before any demand is made (Carpenter v. Broion, 6 Barb. 147; Driggs v. Dwiight, 17 Wend. 71), or by a refusal to perform except on unwarrantable conditions. (Rider v. Pond, 19 N. Y. 262.) And it is not necessary to be made if the debtor has put it out of his own power to perform. (Sharp v. Whipple, 1 Bosw. 568; Schroeder v. Hudson River B. R. Co., 5 Duer, 55, 62; Clark v. Crandall, 3 Barb. 612; McNish v. Coon, 13 Wend. 26; Delamater v. Miller, 1 Cow. 75; Lovelock v. Franklyn, 8 Q. B. 378; Short v. Stone, id. 369; Caines v. Smith, 15 Mees. & W. 190; Bowdell v. Parsons, 10 East, 361.),How to be pleaded.]-When a demand is necessary to be averred, it should be stated with reasonable particularity. (Carpenter v. Brown, 6 Barb. 147; Bush v. Stevens, 24 Wend. 256; Bach v. Owen, 5 T. R. 409.) If the defendant had an option to perform either of two acts, the com- plaint must aver a demand for the performance of one or the other at his option, and not merely a demand for the performance of one only. (Lutweller v. Innell, 12 Barb. 512.),Where a demand has not actually been made, but has been waived or excused, the facts which justify its omis- sion must be pleaded, and not a demand (Garvey v. _Fowler, 4 Sands. 665); for evidence in excuse of a de- mand will not be admitted under an averment of an actual demand. (Ib.) If the omission of a demand is excused by a refusal of the defendant before the time at which performance is due, it must be alleged that such refusal was addressed to the plaintiff. (Traver v. Haisted, 23 Wend.. 66.),ART. 4.-Averrment of notice. When necessary.]-Whenever the fact upon which the defendant's liability depends, lies peculiarly within the 94
Averment of notice. When not necessary. How alleged. plaintiff's knowledge, notice thereof ought to be given by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the giving of such notice must be averred in the complaint. (Comyn's Dig., Pleader, 0. 73.) Thus where one covenanted to do no act to prejudice an insurance upon his life proposed to be taken out by the other party, and, without knowing that the insurance had been effected, visited a foreign country, and thereby caused a forfeiture of the insurance, it was held that. without proof of notice to him of the existence and terms of the policy, he was not liable for breach of his covenant. (Vyse v. Wakefield, 6 Mees. & W. 442; asf'd, 7 id. 126.),When not necessary.]--When the facts are not more peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiff than of the defendant, notice need not be averred. (Cllough v. Hoffmtan, 5 Wend. 499; 2 Saund. 62 a [4]; Coimyn's Dig., Pleader, C. 85.),Thus, where A. undertakes to pay, if B. does not, no notice of the default of B. need be given to A. (Heebner v. Townsend, 8 Abb. 238; Douglass v. Howlland, 24 Wend. 48; Lent v. Padelford, 10 Mass. 238; Williams v. Granger, 4 Day, 447.) So in an action on an award, it is not neces- sary to allege any notice thereof to the defendant. (2 Salnd. 62 a [4]; see Douglass v. sHowland, 24 Wend. 49.) And where notice would ordinarily be necessary, yet the defendant may by his acts excuse notice. (See Shultz v. Depuy, sp. t., 3 Abb. 252.) Thus the drawer of a check, who had no funds at the bank at the time, is not entitled to notice. (Ib.; see Garvey v. Fow2ler, 4 Sands. 665.) How alleged.]--When notice is necessary it should be shown to have been given to the proper person (Coomnyn's Dig., Pleader, C. 74), and it has been said, in due time (ib.), but this is sufficiently implied in a general averment of notice. (Seb Pirth v. Thrush, 8 Barn. & Ores. 391; Dwight v. Wing, 2 M'Lean, 580.),95
Averment of notice. Conditions precedent. How alleged. If it is sought to excuse the omission of notice, the facts excusing it should be pleaded. Evidence in excuse is not admissible under an averment of actual notice. (Garvey v. Fowler, 4 Sands. 665; see Oakley v. Morton, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 33; Kelly v. Upton, 3 Duer, 342; Shultz v. Depuy, sp. t., 3'Abb. 252.) But it may be shown, under an averment of due notice, that the defendant waived imperfections in the notice. (See Holmes v. bolmes, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 525.),ART. 5.-Colnditions precedent. Wh7en performnance must be alleged.]-When a condition precedent exists, its performance must invariably be al- leged or its non-performance excused. (Oalley v. Morton, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 26; Hatch v. Peet, 23 Barb. 575; see Wolfe v. Howes, 20 N. Y. 197.),xcusinlg perfornU nce.]-Where the non-performance of a condition precedent is occasioned by the act of God, or of the law, the fact may be alleged by way of excuse. (Semble, Wolfe v. Howes, 20 N. Y. 197; Jones v. Jutdd, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 411.) Or if before the time appointed for the fulfillment of the condition, the other party to the contract disqualifies himself for performing it on his part, or gives notice that he will not perform it, that fact may be stated as an excuse for the plaintiff's non-performance (Clark: v. Crandall, 27 Barb. 73; North v. Pepper, 21 Wend. 636), for which it is a complete justification. (Cornwell v. Haight, 21 N. Y. 462; Crary v. Smith, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 60; Skinner v. Tinker, 34 Barb. 333; Crist v. Armour, id. 378.),How alleged.]-It is not necessary to state the facts showing performance of a condition precedent. It is sufficient to state that the party who was bound by it has duly performed all the conditions on his part, and if this is denied, the facts showing performance must be proved 96
Conditions procedent. How alleged. Conditions concnrrent. on the trial. (Code, Â§ 162; as construed in Rowland v. Phalen, 1 Bosw. 58.),A substantial compliance with the requirements of this section is sufficient. It is not necessary to adopt the precise language of the Code. (Keteltas v. Myers, 19 N. Y. 231; Adams v. Sherri7l, sp. t., 14 How. 297; overruling Gral7ini v. Macl7ado, 6 Duer, 518; Keteltas v. Myers, 3 E. D. Smith, 83.) Thus an allegation that the plaintiff "fully and faithfully performed," &c., was held sufficient. (Rowland V. Phalen, 1 Bosw. 59.),The pleader is not obliged to avail himself of this pro- vision of the Code. (See Mayor of N. Y. v. Doody, sp. t., 4 Abb., 127.) But if he omits to avail himself of this provision, and undertakes to set forth the facts consti- tuting performance, he must do so fully and completely; and an omission to allege performance of any one of several conditions would be fatal on demurrer. (Hatch v. Peet, 23 Barb. 575.),Where performance has not, in fact, been rendered, the facts in excuse thereof should be stated. For under an allegation of performance, evidence in excuse of non- performance is not admissible. (Oakley v. Morton, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 26, 33; Kelly v. Upton, 5 Duer, 342; Garvey v. Fowler, 4 Sands. 665.) But it may be shown that the defendant'agreed to accept an imperfect performance as sufficient. (Iolines v. IIolnes, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 525.) It will not suffice to allege that the plaintiff performed all the conditions on his part except wherein the sane were waived or altered by the defendant. (Smnith v. Brown, 17 Barb. 481.) The conditions waived, or modifications made, must be stated. (lb.),ART. G.-Conditions concurrent. In an action upon a contract containing conditions concurrent, i. e., requiring the performance of mutually dependant acts on both sides, the complaint must aver an offer of fill performance on the part of the plaintiff.,13,97
Conditions concurrent. Breach. (Beecher v. Coiradt, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 108; Lester v. Jewett, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 243; Dunham v. Pettee, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 508; Smith v. Wright [Ot. of Appeals], 1 Abb. 243; aff'g S. 0., 5 Sands. 113; Considerant v. Brisbane, 14 How. 487; Merwin v. Hamilton, 6 Duer, 244; Van Sclhaick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 89.) A mere averment of readiness and willingness to perform is not sufficient. (Lester v. Jewett; Van Schaick v. Winne, supra.),If, however, a place is fixed by the contract for mutual performance, it is sufficient to allege a readiness and will- ingness to perform at that place. (Bronson v. Winan, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 182; Vail v. Rice, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 155; Coonley v. Aiderswo, 1 Hill, 519; see Cornwell v. Haighlt, 21 N. Y. 462.) But in such case it is essential to aver readiness, &c., at that place. (Clark v. Dales, 20 Barb. 43, 65.),The short form of pleading authorized by the Code in relation to conditions precedent, has no application to conditions concurrent, and therefore the complaint must, in strictness, show what the plaintiff offered to do by way of performance. Nevertheless, a general allegation that the plaintiff "offered duly to perform all the conditions of the agreement on his part" is not demurrable, and is usually treated as sufficient, in analogy to the mode of pleading authorized in the case of conditions precedent. Probably it would not be required to be made more explicit, even on motion.,An offer of performance is excused by the same state of facts which excuses the performance of conditions precedent. (See Cornwell v. Haight, 21 N. Y. 462; North v. Pepper, 21 Wend. 636; Main v. King, 8 Barb. 537; Rivara v. Ghio, 3 E. D. Smith, 267.),ART. 7.-Breach. It has always been held necessary, in an action for ordinary relief, that the complaint should allege a breach of the contract sued upon (Comyn's Dig., Pleader, C. 44; 98
Breach. How to be pleaded Newton v. Wilmot, 8 Mees. & W. 722), as without a breach there would be no cause of action. (lb.) In every action for damages upon the breach of a written agreement, whether under seal or not, the complaint must assign the specific breaches for which the action is brought. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 661; [2 id. 378 ;] see Western Bank v. Sherwood, 29 Barb. 383.) But it may be doubted whether, where the breach consists merely in failure to pay money, it need be pleaded. (See ante, p. 16.),In actions for special relief, it is sometimes enough to show that there is good reason to anticipate a breach of the contract.,How to be pleaded.]-The facts which it is claimed con- stitutes a breach must be stated. It is not enough to allege that the defendant "failed to fulfill" his agreement (aan Sc7aick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 89, 95), nor that he acted " in violation" thereof. (Sclencik v. Naylor, 2 Duer, 675.) The breach may be assigned in the very words of the covenant (Brown v. Stebbins, 4 Hill, 154; Smith v. Janlsen, 8 Johns. 111; Hughes v. Smith, 5 id. 168), if such a statement necessarily shows a breach (lb.), but not otherwise. (Thomas v. Van Ness, 4 Wend. 549; Jul- liand v. Burgott, 11 Johns. 6.) And it is never necessary to adopt the precise language of the contract. (Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 127; Potter v. Bacon, 2 Wend. 583.),An exception in a covenant need not be noticed in assigning a breach. (Wheeler v. Bavidge, 9 Exch. 672.) It is not necessary to show that the breach occurred before the commencement of the action. (iSitl v. Holmes, 19 N. Y. 271; Maynard v. Talcott, 11 Barb. 569.) If it did not, that is matter of defense. (Ib.) When a breach has been assigned in sufficient general terms, the plaintiff cannot now be prejudiced by the addition of some particulars of the defendant's act, as he was before the Code.* Even under the old practice, if * See, as to the former practice, Harris v. Mantle (3 T. It. 307); Radford v. McIntosh (id. 637); Carpenter v. Barker (3 C. B. [N. S.] 206, 243).,99
Breach. How to be pleaded. Must not be too narrow. such matters were stated under a videlicet, the plaintiff was not confined to evidence of those only at the trial (Moore v. Clark. 5 Taunt. 95); and under the Code there can be no distinction on this ground.,Breach nmust not be too narrow.]-The breach assigned must not be narrower than the covenant.,If the contract gives the defendant an option to per- form either of the two acts, it must be shown that lihe performed neither. (People v. Tilton, 13 Wend. 597; Lut- weller v. iinnell, 12 Barb. 512.) And where two persons have covenanted that if they are condemned, they will render themselves, an averment that one of them was condemned, and that "they" had not rendered them- selves, is insufficient; for the one who was condemned might have rendered himself, consistently with such an allegation, and that would satisfy the terms of the agree- ment. (Wilkinson. v. Thorl7e., 4 Man. & Sel. 33.),But in an action on a covenant by several persons to pay a certain sum, it is enough to say that " they" have not paid, inasmuch as a payment by one would be a pay- ment by all. (Aleberrq v. IValtby, 1 Strange, 231.) And so where the defendant agreed to pay to several persons jointly, it is sufficient to aver that lie did not pay to " them." (Ib.; see Deben7lamv v. Chambers, 3 Mees. & W. 128.) And where the defendant agreed to pay a sum to A., for the benefit of B., it is sufficient to aver that he did not pay to A. (Rowland v. Phatle, 1 Bosw. 43.) So where one covenants for himself, his heirs and assigns, &c., to perform an act, it is enough to allege, in an action against him, that he has not performed. (Gyse v. Ellis, 1 Strange, 228; overruling Colt v. How, Cro. Eliz. 348.) And where one covenants " to pay, or cause to be paid," it is a sufficient statement of breach to aver that he did not " pay." (Aleberry v. Walby, 1 Strange, 231.),Breach mnust lnot be too large.]-The breach assigned must not be larger than the obligation. (Conynj's Dig., Pleader, 0. 47.) 100
Breach mtust not be too large. Damages. Special demand. Thus, in an action for breach of covenant of title, the complaint must allege that the eviction of the plaintiff was by a person having lawful title (Folliard v. Wallace, 2 Johns. 402; Greenlby v. Wilcocks, id. 4), and that not derived from the plaintiff. (Carpenter v. Parker, 3 C. B. [N. S.] 206.),ART. 8.-Dantages. In every action for tile recovery of money, the com- plaint must state facts from which it can be inferred, as matter of law, that the plaintiff has suffered damage. (Rider v. Pond, 28 Barb. 447; Gould v. Allen, 1 Wend. 182; see Nearyl v. Bostwick, 2 Hilt. 514.),It was usual, in the old system of pleadings, to con- clude all declarations (except in q(i tarn actions), whether in tort, assumpsit, or debt, with the clause " to the dam- age of the plaintiff ........ dollars" (see Yates' Plead- ings, 167, 456; 2 Chit. PI. 17, 20), and its omission was a ground for a special demurrer. (O'Connor v. Be7ecn, 9 Irish Law, 506.),This clause was, however, purely a matter of form, and as such is abolished by the Code. It has been universally dropped in actions for liquidated debts, but has been generally retained in actions for unliquidated damages, and most pleaders would be afraid to omit it. But there is no more authority for retaining it in this class of actions than any other. It is wholly abolished in Eng- land by the Common Law Procedure act (1852), and not being issuable (M'Kensie v. Farrell, 4 Bosw. 202; Hackett v. Richards, 3 E.D. Smith, 31; see Smith v. Tlhomas, 4 Dowl. P. C. 339), is clearly a violation of the rule that nothing but issuable facts should be pleaded (ante, p. 17), while it does not accomplish any purpose which is not equally well affected by the demand of judgment.,Special damage.]-While such damage as necessarily results from the act complained of need not be set forth in the complaint (BaRr.so v. aadlan, 2 Johns. 149; see,101
Special damage. The thing injured. Vanderslice v. Newton, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 130; Laraway v. Perkins, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 371), all other damage (commonly called special damage) must be (Vanulerslice v. Newton, supra; Bogert v. Bturkhalter, 2 Barb. 525; Squire v. Gould, 14 Wend. 159; Slack v. Brown, 13 id. 390; De Forest v. Leete, 16 Johns, 122; Herrick v. Lap- haum, 10 id. 281), and, if not pleaded, cannot be proved. (lb.; Low v. Archer, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 282.),If the action will not lie at all without special damage, the allegations of such damage are issuable (Davis v. Mayor of N. Y., 14 N. Y. 506, 526; Perring v. Harris, 2 Mood. & Rob. 5), but not in any other case. (Smith v. Thomas, 4 Dowl. P. c. 339; Moloney v. Dows, sp. t., 15 How. 265.) We cannot, therefore, conceive of any action upon contract in which such allegations could be made the subject of an issue, except, perhaps, in an action upon an agreement to indemnify, in which the fact and extent of the plaintiff's loss is, of course, material. That is not, however, a damage arising from the defendant's breach of contract, for it must exist before his contract can be broken.,CHAPTER XLV. COMPLAINTS UPON WRONGS. ARTICLE 1.

But there are not now any strict rules uppn this subject. Any reason- ably truthful description will suffice.,T7ue plaintiff's interest.]-It is obviously necessary to connect the plaintiff in some way with the thing injured, as no one can be allowed to sue for a wrong committed solely against another person, except in actions given by statute to any one who will sue.,Thus if the action is upon an injury to a third person, it must appear that he was the plaintiff's servant. (See Dain v. Wycof, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 191; artley v. Richt- nwyer, 2 Barb. 182; 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 28.),If the injury was to property, it must be shown that it belonged to the plaintiff. (Pinkewy v. Inlcbitants, &c., of luttland, 2 Saund. 379, and note.) It s however sufficient, in an action upon a mere trespass, to allege possession in the plaintiff at the time of the injury. (Kissam v. Roberts, 6 Bosw. 154; Hendrickls v. Decker, 35 Barb. 298; Beatty v. Swarthout, 32 id. 293; see aRtthbone v. McCon- sell, 21 N. Y. 466; Palner v. Aldridge, 16 Barb. 131; Whitney v. Wright, 15 Wend. 171; Day v. Alverson, 9 id. 223; Jackson v. Harder, 4 Johns. 202; Jackson v. Hazen, id. 22; Harker v. Birkbeck, 3 Burr. 1563.),Even where actual ownership is alleged, a very brief statement of the fact is sufficient. Thus in the case of chattels, it is enough to describe them as "the plaintiff's," (Davis v. Hoppock, 6 Duer, 254; Heine v. Anderson, 2 id. 318,) and in case of land to allege that the plaintiff is the "owner in fee simple," or otherwise. (Walter v. Lockwood, 23 Barb. 228; 4 Abb, 307; Ensign v. Sherinan, 14 How. 439.),ART. 2.-T7w defendant's duty. If the act or omission complained of was not necessarily wrongful, but was so in the particular case in hand by,103
The defeidlnut's duty. Thim injury reason of some special duty resting upon the defendant, it is indispensable that the facts fi'om which the law infers such duty should be alleged. (City of Buffalo v. Iollowvay, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 493; Taylor v. Atlantic Ins. Co., 2 Bosw. 111; Congrecc v. Morgan, 4 Ducr, 448; Casey v. Mann, sp. t., 5 Abb. 91; Bartlett v. Crozier, [Ct. of Errors,] 17 Johns. 456; Hancock v. York, Newcastle & Ber:ick Railroad Co., 10 C. B. 348, 355; Brown v. Mallett, 5 C. B. 615; Sey)olur v. Maddox, 16 Q. B. 330; Lancaster Canal Co. v. Parnaby, 11 Adol. & El. 242; Crane v. Cllalipman, 5 Adol. & El. 651, 658; Boorman v. Brownl, 4 Perry & Dav. 401, 405; Max v. Roberts, 12 East, 89, 94.) It is not enough, even on demurrer, to allege that "it was the duty of the de- fendant" to perform a certain act. (Ib.),ART. 3.-The iijurly. The act which is complained of is to be stated substan- tially as it is to be proved. It is not necessary to negative every possible supposition which would make the act innocent.,Thus in an action for wrongfully taking goods, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant "took" them. (Childs v. Hart, 7 Barb. 370.) And notwithstanding the doubt expressed in Turner v. McCarthy (4 E. D. Smith, 248), we are satisfied that an allegation that the defend- ant "entered" upon the plaintiff's land is equivalent to tn averment of wrongful entry. For the simple fict of an entry, standing alone, is prinma facie a wrong, and if the defendant had permission to enter, that is an affirma- tive defense which he is bound to set up.,It is not necessary to state the injury with much par- ticularity, inasmuch as the defendant is presumptively better informed of the facts than the plaintiff. (See ante, p. 23.) Thus in an action for the conversion of personal property, it is not necessary to show how the defendant converted it. (Decker v. Matthewis, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 321.) 104
Demand. When to be pleaded.,ART. 4.-Demand. A demand is sometimes necessary to make a party liable to an action in tort as well as contract, and of course when it is necessary to be made, it must be pleaded.,Thus, in an action to recover chattels, to the possession of which the plaintiff is entitled, if the defendant lawfully acquired possession of the property in the first instance, a demand must be alleged to have been made before suit. (Stevens v. Hyde, 32 Barb. 181; Powers v. Bassford, 19 How. 309; Puller v. Lewis, sp. t., 3 Abb. 383; 13 How. 219; see Gurney v. Kenney, 2 E. D. Smith, 132; Hunter v. Hudson River 2achine Co., 20 Barb. 500; Barrett v. War- rea, 3 Hill, 348.) But no demand is necessary before bringing an action against one who wrongfully takes property (N. Y. Car Oil Co. v. Richl7mwd, 6 Bosw. 213; 10 Abb. 185; Hunter v. Hudson River Machine Co., 20 Barb. 500; Moses v. Walker, 2 Hilt. 536) unless the action is brought by one to whom the property (not the claim) was assigned after the taking, in which case it is required. (Stevens v. Hyde, 32 Barb. 181; Bliss v. Cottle, id. 322; Hassell v. Borden, 1 Hilt. 128; SlIerman v. Elder, id. 178.) In a like action brought by the assignee of the right of action, no demand need be alleged or proved (McKee v. Judd, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 626); nor is it necessary as against any transferee of the wrongful taker, unless he received the property in good faith ('allman v. 'Turck, 26 Barb. 167; Pringle v. Phillips, 5 Sands. 157; Pierce v. Van Dyke, 6 Hill, 613), and as good faith will not be pre- sumed in favor of one acquiring property under such circumstances (T1allman v. Turck; Pierce v. Van Dyke, supra) it seems unnecessary to plead a demand in any such case.,The same rules apply to an action for the value of property converted to the defendant's use, where the facts constituting a conversion are set out in the colm-,14,105
Demand. Knowledge of the defendant. plaint. But if any positive act of conversion is alleged, no demand is necessary. (Davidson v. Donadi, 2 E. D. Smith, 121.),In an action for the continuance of a nuisance erected by a third person, it is usually held that a demand for its removal must be shown (Hubbard v. Russell, 24 Barb. 404); but DENO, J., considered this to be unnecessary, except in an action for abatement of the nuisance (Browon v. Cayuga & Susquehanna R. B. Co., 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 492), the Court of Appeals declining to pass upon the question.,Equitable actions.j-It ought to have been mentioned before (see ante, p. 92), that in actions of a purely equita- ble origin, whether upon a contract or a wrong, a demand before suit is never essential to sustain the complaint. (Bruce v. Tilson. 25 N. Y., 194.),ART. 5.-Knowledge of tie defendant. When to be pleaded.]-It is often necessary to aver the defendant's knowledge of facts which put him in the wrong. Indeed, we think it may be stated as a general rule that when the act complained of is one that in its own nature might have occurred without a wrongful intention or neglect on the part of the defendant, it must appear that he had knowledge or notice of facts which imposed upon him an obligation to avoid or pre- vent such act.,Thus, tame animals being presumptively harmless, a complaint upon injuries committed by a dog (Fairchild v. Bentley, 30 Barb. 147,156; Tluunas v. Morgan, 2 Cr. M. & R. 496; 4 Dowl. P. 0. 223), or other domestic animal (Tan Leuven v. Lyke, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 515; Yroomavn v. Lawyer, 13 Johns. 339), while in a place in which it might lawfully be (Ib.), must allege that the defendant knew the habit or disposition of the animal to commit such injuries. But if the animal is of a savage species (see Fan Leuven v. Lykic, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 515), or if, 106
Knowledge of the defendant. When to be pleaded being tame, it commits an injury while trespassing on the plaintiff's land (Ib.), no averment of knowledge is necessary. So where the plaintiffsued forinjuries inflicted by horses sent to train in a public place, full of people, it was held that he need not aver that the defendant knew they were unruly, the place to which they were sent being plainly an improper one for the purpose. (Michael v. Alestree, 2 Levinz, 172.),A special exception is made by statute (2 R. S. (5th ed.) 975; [1 id. 704]) in the case of an action against the owner of a dog for the value of sheep killed by the latter. No averment as to the habits of the dog, or the know- ledge of the owner, is necessary in such case. (Fish v. Skut, 21 Barb. 333.),In an action by an employee against his employer for injuries suffered in the course of service, occasioned by a defect in the materials used in the business, or by the negligence of a fellow servant, the complaint must allege that the defendant knew, or had notice of such defect, or the incompetency of such fellow servant (McMillan v. Saratoga & Wash. R. R. Co., 20 Barb. 449; see Keegan v. Western R. R. Co., 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 175; Sherman v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 17 N. Y. 153; Eutchinson v. York, &Sc. Railway Co., 5 Exch. 343), or must state facts which show that the defendant ought to have known such defect. (See RyJan v. Fowler, 24 N. Y. 410.),So in an action for enticing away the plaintiff's wife or servant, the complaint must allege that the defendant knew the person enticed to be such wife or servant. (Winsmore v. Greenbank, Willes, 582; see Fores v. Wilson, Peake N. P. 55.) And in an action for harboring a ser- vant, it must appear not only that the defendant knew him to be such, but also that he knew that he was absent without the plaintiff's consent. (lb.) In an action upon a nuisance not created by the de- fendant, it must appear that the defendant knew of its existence. (Hubbard v. Russell, 24 Barb. 404; see Wins- more v. Greenbank, Willes, 583.),107
Knowledge of the defenldant. Inteltion or unlicp. In an action on deceit, the complaint must allege that the defendant knew his representations to be false (ila(bey v. Adams, 3 Bosw. 34(i; Bayard.( v. 3allcolm, 1 Johns. 453; 2 id. 550; Behn v.Ke Iemble, 7 C. B. [N. S.] 260; ltus- sell v. Clark, 7 Crancl, 92; see Gerhard v. Bates, 2 Ell. & B1. 476), orthat lie neither knew nor had any reason to believe them to be true. (See Bennett v. .Tdlson, 21 N. Y. 23S; Zab)risk7i v. Smith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 322; Adamson v. Jarvis, 4 Bing. 73; cEans v. Etdmonds, 130. B. 776; Evans v. Collins, 5 Q. B. 804.),In an action on malicious prosecution, no allegation concerning the defendant's knowledge or belief is neces- sary. (Ross v. Norman, 5 Exch. 359.),liow to be leaded.]-Tle proper mode of alleging the defendant's knowledge is undoubtedly a direct averment that Ihe "k new," or "lhad notice " of the fact; but not- withstanding a recent decision (Mllabey v. Adams, 3 Bosw. 34() to the contrary, we are clearly of opinion that an allegation that the defendant " falsely and fraudulently rprresented " a certain state of things to exist, is a sufli- cient averment, on demurrer, that lie knew his state- ments to lbe false. (See 'Bayard v. Malcolm, 2 Johns. 550; Zabriskie v. Smith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 322. (Since the above was written, it has been so settled. (Thomas v. Becbe, 25, N. Y. 244.),ART. 6.-Intention, or malice. When to be l)lea(ded.]-In some cases, the intention with which the defendant committed the injury complained of is the very gist of the action. In other cases, it is a mat- ter important only as an aggravation, or otherwise, of the offense.,r'he intention with which the defendant acted is a material issue in an action upon false representations (Addilngton v. Allen [Ct. of Errors], 11 Wend. 386; f(abey v. Adams, 3 Bosw. 346; Bevh v. Kemble, 7 C. B. [N. S.] 108

Peck, 5 Johns. 196, 210; Philp v. Squire, Peake N. P. 82); or for malicious prosecution (Vanlderbilt v. Malfthis, 5 Duer, 304; De Medina v. Grove, 10 Q. B. 1(i8, 177); or for slander of title (Kendall v. Stone, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 14); or against an attorney for surren- dering a prisoner in the name of his bail, without positive authority. (Porter v. Weston, 5 Bing. N. C. 715; 8 Scott, 25.),But in an action for an injunction against tile repetition of a particular act, the defiedant's intention in commit- ting such act is imlmaterial. (Dale v. Smithso,, 12 Abb. 237; Mlillinitont v. Fox, 3 M3yl. & Cr. 338.) And if an act is legal, it is of no importance whether the actor sul)- pOSed it to be so, and acted with a lawful intention, or not. (Spotswoodl v. Barrow, 5 Exch. 112 ; Oakes v. Wood, 2 Mlees. & W. 79(;; but see Porter v. IVeston, 5 Bing. N. 0. 715; 8 Scott, 36.),In an action upon a publication libellous on its face, and unprivileged, the complaint need not allege malice in the lefendant (H-Iltt v. Bentnelt, 19 N. Y. 173; ltoot v. King, 7 Cow. 620), though whether this is because the deiendant's intention is immaterial, or because it is iul)licd, may be doubted. (See Viele v. Gray, sp. t., 10 Abb. 6; 18 How. 550.),How to be yle(tded.]-I- n an action upon false represen- tations made to procure credit for a third person, the proper form of averring intention in ordliary cases, is to allege that the defendant acted "with intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff," (Zabriskie v. Smith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 330; Addigton v. Allen1 , 11 Wrend. 386), and it is essential that a complaint in such cases should allege that tile defendant inntened to deceive and defraud the plaintiff, or tlhe public, or should contain some similar averment. (lb.) But as there are cases in which the defendant may not have actually intended to injure tl.,109

Walter, 3 Barn. & Adol. 114), this averment may be modified to meet such cases, if desired, though any falsehood, told with intent to induce another to change his position, and take a risk, is a fraud in law. (Murray v. Mann, 2 Exch. 541; See 27hon. v. Bigland, 8 id. 731.),The word "maliciously" is a sufficient averment of malice in fact as well as law. (Viele v. Gray, sp. t., (10 Abb. 1; 18 How. 550.) But an averment that an act was " wrongfully and injuriously" done, is not an aver- ment of express malice. (Saxon v. Castle, 6 Ad. & El. 652, 658; see Sc7eiibel v. Fairbain, 1 Bos. & Pul. 391.),ART. 7.-Damtages. The rules stated heretofore (ante, 101), in relation to damages upon the breach of contracts, apply equally to complaints upon wrongs. Some further application of the rules concerning special damage, is all that seems to be necessary here.,Special dacmage, when material.]-Special damage is essential to the maintenance of an action by a private individual to abate or restrain a public nuisance (Davis v. Mayor of N. Y., 14 N. Y. 526; Lansing v. Wiswall, 5 Denio, 213), or to enforce the performance of a duty owed to the public by a public officer. (Butler v. Kent, 19 Johns. 223; see Perring v. Harris, 2 Mood. & Rob. 5.) So in an action for slander of title (Kendall v. Stone, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 14; Malachy v. Soper, 3 Bing. N. C. 382), or for slanderous words, not actionable in themselves (Keen- holts v. Becker, 3 Denio, 346; Beach v. Ranney, 2 Hill, 309), or upon a publication not libellous on its face (Cooper v. Stone [Ct. of Errors], 2 Denio, 293; Bennett v. Williamson, 4 Sands. 60; Caldvell v. Raymond, sp. t., 2 Abb. 193), an averment of special damage is necessary.,In an action for injuries caused by mere negligence, if it is desired to recover damages for the effect of such 110

Smith, 460.),In an action against a sheriff for neglecting to return an execution, special damage need not be alleged. The measure of damages, prima facie, is the amount of the execution; (Ledyard v. Jones, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 550; over- ruling Stevens v. Rowe, 3 Denio, 327.),How to be pleaded.]-Special damage must be set forth with particularity. If the loss of customers is alleged, their names must be stated (Linden v. Grahamn, 1 Duer, 670; Hallock v. Miller, 2 Barb. 630; Tobias v. Harland, 4 Wend. 537), unless it is, in the nature of the ease, impos- sible to do so. (E'vans v. Harries, 1 Hurl. & N. 251; Har- rison v. Pearce, 1 Fost. & Fin. 570; see Hartley v. Her- ring, 8 T. B. 130.),The want of particularity in the statement of special damage has been held fatal on demurrer, in an action resting solely upon such damage (Linden v. Graham, 1 Duer, 670), but this decision is, we are well satisfied, erroneous. The want of such definiteness is, as we have seen, excusable in some cases, and yet no excuses could be offered on demurrer. A motion under section 160 is obviously the proper method of correcting such a defect, that proceeding being a substitute for special demurrer. (See People v. lider, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433.) The old cases (Cro. Jac. 499; 1 Ventr. 5) in which such allega- tions were held bad on general demurrer, were decided in times when to describe a stove as "ferramentumn, Anglice, a stove" was a ground of general demurrer for false Latin.,111

ART. 1.- Viat relief shotull be demanded. The complaint must demand all the relief to which the plaintiff considers himself entitled (Code, Â§ 142), and great care should be taken to demand appropriate relief, for if no answer is put in, the plaintiff can have no other or greater relief than his comp)laint demands (Code, Â§ 275; Simo1so n v. Blake, 12 Abb. 331; 20 How. 484), and, of course, if the relief asked is entirely unwarranted by the facts stated, no judg ment at all can be rendered upon default.,Final judgment only should be demanded. The colm- plaint has nothingl to do with provisional remedies (see ante,p. 17), and should not therefore demand any of them, not even an injmlction* or receiver )pending suit.,(osts.]-It is unnecessary to demand costs in any case. They are granted or refised on principles whlich are in no way affected by the presence or absence of a demand for them. (See Code, Â§ 304.),.Legal and equitable relicf.]-Tlie complaint may demand both legal and equitable relief, if warranted by the facts of the case. (Phillips v. Gorham, 17 N. Y. 270; and post, chap. cviii.),Thus a complaint may demand judgment canceling a a deed of land under which the defendant clainls title, and also for the possession of the land. (Phillils v. Gor- hiam, supra.) So a complaint may demand the reformlation,Â· Sec a doubt expressed on this point in Vincent v. King (sp. t., 13 IIow. 239), W ae have owever no doubt upon the subject. 112
What relief should be demanded. Legal and equitable. Inconsistent. Form. of a deed, and also judgment upon it as reformed. (Bid- cell v. Astor Mutual Ins. Co., 16 N. Y. 263; Gooding v. SWAlister, sp. t., 9 How. 123.) A demand for a perpetual injunction against the repetition of an act may be united with a claim for damages caused by such act. (Getty v. HJtdson River R. B. Co., sp. t., 6 How. 269.) Where a vendor of land conveys it by a full covenant warranty deed, and a prior mortgage, unsatisfied of record, is dis- covered, which the vendor insists is satisfied, and which the mortgagee claims has not been paid, the purchaser may, in an action against the vendor and the mortgagee, de- mand: 1. That the amount actually due on the mortgage be ascertained; 2. That upon his paying the amount due, the mortgage may be satisfied of record; 3. That the vendor pay him the amount so paid. (Wandle v. Tilrney, 5 Duer, 661.) Inconsistent demands.]-Where several linds of relief are demanded, they must not be inconsistent with each other. (Linden v. Hel)pbitn, 3 Sands. 668; 5 How. 188; Lanmport v. Abbott, sp. t., 12 How. 340; MIax2iell v. Farnam,, sp. t., 7 id. 236.) Thus a claim for the possession of a chattel cannot be united with a claim for its value as converted (Maxwell v. Farnlam, sp. t., 7 How. 236; see Chappell v. Skinner, sp. t., 6 id. 338), nor with a claim for its price, as upon a sale. (See 3orris v. Rsxford, 18 N. Y. 556.) And a demand for an injunction against the further misuse of premises can- not be joined with a demand for their forfeiture on account of such misuse. (Linden v. Hepburn, 3 Sands. 668; 5 How. 188.),ART. 2.-Formt of demand. The complaint must specify the relief desired.' The demand must not be vague nor hypothetical. (Durant v. Gardner, sp. t., 10 Abb. 445; 19 How. 94; Lanwreux v. Atlantic ltMututal Ins. Co., 3 Duer, 680.) If the recovery,15,113
Form of demand. Remedy against error. of money is demanded, the amount thereof must be stated. (Code, Â§ 142.),Alternative demand.]-The very object of requiring a demand for relief to be inserted is to enable the defendant to know precisely what judgment will be taken against him if he fails to answer. Obviously, this purpose would be entirely defeated, if the plaintiff should be allowed to put his demand in an alternative or hypothetical form; and he is therefore required to elect in his complaint what relief he will ask, and cannot demand alternative (Durant v. Gard- ner, sp. t., 10 Abb. 445; 19 How. 94) nor hypothetical (Lamoreux v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., 3 Duer, 680) relief. (Sec People v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 28 Barb. 240; 8 Abb. 7; 17 How. 56; Warwick v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 7 Abb. 265; 28 Barb. 210; but see Redmould v. Dana, 3 Bosw. 615.),General relief.]-The old demand for general relief is unauthorized by the Code. It will not be allowed in con- nection with a mere money demand (Durant v. Gardner, sp. t.. 10 Abb. 445; 19 How. 94), and ought not to be allowed in any case. For if the defendant answers, the plaintiff may have any relief to which the facts entitle him, without regard to the demand of relief (7Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Barlow v. Scott, 24 id. 40; Martquat v. Marquat, 12 id. [2 Kern.] 336), and if he does not answer, the plaintiff cannot be allowed to avail himself of a demand for general relief, but will be confined to that which he has specifically asked. (Simonson v. Blale, 12 Abb. 331; 20 How. 484.),Remedy against error.]--\To error in the demand of relief can afford a ground for a demurrer (Witherhead v. Allen, 28 Barb. 661; Meyer v. Van Collem, 28 Barb. 230; 7 Abb. 222; Lord v. Yreeland, sp. t., 13 id. 195; People v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 28 Barb. 240; 8 Abb. 7, 19; Beale v. Hayes, 5 Sands. 640; Beccer v.

Extension of time. ART. 1.-Time toplead. In ordinary cases.]-The defendant must serve an an- swer or demurrer to the complaint within twenty days after service of the copy of the complaint. (Code, Â§ 143.) The language of this section is to be literally construed as fixing a period within which the defendant mtst answer, unless he obtains an extension of time. And though it was formerly thought (Foster v. Udell, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 30), that an answer might be served after the twenty days had expired, if the plaintiff had not actually taken judg- ment, it is now settled to the contrary. (M'Gown v.

Hubbard, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 70.),It has been decided, at general term, that unless the defendant demtand a copy of the complaint, his time for answering runs from the service of the summons, and a voluntary service of the complaint does not extend the time to answer. (Van Pelt v. Boyer, 7 How. 325.),If the attorney for the defendant resides in a different place from the attorney for the plaintiff, the answer may be served by depositing it in the mail, on the last day allowed for service. (Noble v. Trotter, sp. t., 4 How. 322; Radcelff v. Van Benthuysen, sp. t., 3 id. 67; Brown v. Briggs, sp. t., 1 id. 152), provided there is a regular com- munication by mail between the two places. (Schenick v. APKie, sp. t., 4 How. 246.),The defendant is not at liberty to answer the complaint until it has been served or filed, or until he has in some way been acquainted with its contents. When the com- plaint is not served with the summons, it is not merely the privilege, but the duty of the defendant to demand a copy before answering. (Phillips v. Prescott, sp. t., 9 How. 433.),* W7ie defendant is arrested.]-If the defendant is arrested in the action, he is entitled to twenty days' time after such arrest, in which to answer the complaint. (Code, Â§ 183.)*,Joint debtors.]-SWhere joint debtors are served with the complaint on different days, the time for each one to answer runs from the date when he was served, and a joint answer cannot be served after the expiration of twenty days from the date on which any one of them was served with the complaint. (Jacqutes v. Greemnood, sp. t., 1 Abb. 230.),* As amended, 1862. 116
Time to plead. After publication. Extension of time. When comnplaint served by mail.]-If the complaint is served by mail, the defendant has forty days to answer. (Ante, i. 438.),Time after service by publication.]-When the summons is served by publication, the defendant has twenty days to answer after the expiration of the time prescribed for publication. (Abrahanms v. Mitchell, sp. t., 8 Abb. 123; Tomlinson v. Van Vech7ten, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 317; Dykers v. Woodwiard, sp. t., 7 How. 315.),And when, under an order for publication, the defend- ant is personally served in another state, his time for answering runs nevertheless from the expiration of the time fixed for publication by the order. (Abrahams v. Mitchell; Tomlinson v. Vatn cchten, supra; overruling in effect, Dyl7ers v. Woodwiard, supra.),Alended conm)laint.]-If an amended complaint is served, the defendant's time to answer runs from the date of such service. (Code, Â§ 146; DicLerson v. Beardslcy, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 37.),Time to answer after demlttrrer.]-After a demurrer has been overruled, with leave to withdraw and answer within a specified time, if an appeal is taken from the order and it is affirmed, the demurrant must certainly answer within the same time after the affirmance, even if it is conceded that he can retain the benefit of the permission contained in the order, while appealing from it (Ford v. David, 1 Bosw. 569), which we think he cannot do.,ART. 2.-Extension of time to plead. If the defendant desires any extension of his time to answer, he must obtain the plaintiff's consent in writing, or a judge's order for the purpose. (See Platt v. Townsend, 3 Abb. 9; 6 Duer, 668; 11Goown v. Leavenworth, 2 E. D. Smith, 24.) An order staying the plaintiff's proceedings does not extend the defendants' time to answer. (Ib.),117
Extension of time to plead. Consent. Order. An order or consent extending the time to answer, is an extension of time to answer or demur. (Brodhead v. Brodhead, sp. t., 4 How. 308.),Consent.]-It is customary for the plaintiff's attorney to grant any reasonable extension of time, without com- pelling the defendant to resort to the court. A consent is sometimes made upon terms, such as that the date of the issue shall not be delayed-that an appearance shall be given for a defendant not served with the summons, &c. If the plaintiff's terms are not unreasonable, it is better to comply with them, rather than take the trouble of apply- ing for a judge's order. On the other hand, the plaintiff's attorney should bear in mind the ease with which the defendant may obtain an order, and should not therefore insist upon too stringent conditions, since he may thereby lose the power of imposing any at all.,Though it is usual to obtain the consent from the plaintiff's attorney, yet it is equally valid if obtained from the plaintiff in person, even when he appears by attorney. (Braisted v. Johnson, 5 Sands. 671.),Order.]-An order extending the time to answer, may be obtained from a judge of the court, or, if the action is brought in the Supreme Court, from a county judge. (Code, Â§ 405.) No county judge can grant this order, unless he is judge either of the county in which the action is triable, or of that in which the defendant's attorney resides. (Code, Â§ 401.),The application may be made ex parte. (Wilcock v. Curtis, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 96.),It must be founded upon an affidavit showing cause for granting the motion (Code, Â§ 405), and the defendant, or his attorney or counsel, must swear to merits. (Rdle 22, Supreme Ct.) If the affidavit is made by the attorney, it must allege that from the statement of the case in the action made to him by the defendant, he verily 118

Service of order. believes that the defendant has a good and substantial defense, upon the merits, to the cause of action set forth in the complaint, or to some part thereof. (Id.) If any extension of time has been previously granted, whether by order or consent, that fact must be stated in the affidavit. (Id.),If the judge grants the order, the following form should be in readiness for him to sign.,Â§ 193. Order exteundiig time to answer. [Ytle of cause.] On the annexed affidavit of John Jones, let the defendant have ........ days' further time to answer.,[Jucdge's signature.] How inmilt time may be allowed.]-It was decided in an early case under the Code, that there was no limit to the extension of time which might be granted by a judge on an ex parte application. (Wilcock v. Curtis, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 96.) In England, a captain of a whaling ves- sel, served with summons just as his ship was setting out on a cruise, was allowed twelve months' time to plead, on an application which seems to have been ex parte. And the order was sustained by the court. (Hunt v. Barclay, 3 Dowl. P. C. 646.) Nevertheless, we should think it more safe, in case an extension of more than twenty days is desired, to apply on notice, or to obtain an order to show cause, under which all needful relief might be obtained.,Service of order.]-The order need not be entered with the clerk. (See Savage v. Relyea, sp. t., 3 How. 276.) A copy must be served on the plaintiff's attorney, in the manner prescribed ante, i. 426. It is advisable to show the original order to the person served. The affidavit on which the order was granted, must be,119

Disregarding order. served with it (Code, Â§ 40.5), and if this is not done, the order may be disregarded (id); and if the affidavit served does not include an affidavit of merits by the defendant or his attorney, it is insufficient, and tle order may be disregarded. (Ellis v. YFan Ncss, sp. t., 14 How. 313.),When the opposing attorneys reside in different places, an order extending tle defendant's time to answer mn;a be served by mail on tile last day of the original time; and if before its receipt by the plaintiff's attorney, lie Ials entered judgment by default, it will be set aside. (Sclhtci- ardt v. Roth, sp. t., 10 Abb. 203; Lanler v. Saratoga, &c., Ins. Co., sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 114.) The proper course of a plaintiff who has, under such circumstances, entered an irregular judgnrent, is to offer to the defendant a con- sent to vacate it, without costs. After such an offer, the court would undoubtedly refuse costs.,Order, how construedc.]-If the order gives tile defend- ant a certain number of days' "time to plead," the time will run from the date of the order, without regard to the time to which tle defeindant was otherwise entitled. Thus, if tile regular time for answering expired on the 1st of May, and on the 25th of April the defendant obtained an order giving him ten (lays' " time to answer," his time would expire on tle 5th of May. (Lalne v. Par- sons, 3 Bing. N. C. 263; 3 Scott, 652; 5 Dowl. P. C. 361; Simpson v. Cooper, 2 Scott, 840.) But it seems that if the order gives "further time to answer," the additional time will run from the expiration of the time which tile defend- ant had independently of tile order. (Schenlk v. 3I'Kie, sp. t., 4 How. 247; Lane v. Parsons, 3 Bing. N. C. 264; 3 Scott, 652; Aslinall v. Smiyth, 8 Taunt. 592; 2 J. B. Moore, 655.),Disregarding order.]-If the plaintiff, in disregard of a consent, or of an order of extension regularly made and served, enters judgment as for default, such judgment 120

Curtis, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 96.) For the mode of proceeding to set aside an irregular judgment, see post, chap. If the judge who granted the order had no jurisdiction, it may of course be disregarded, and so if no affidavit be served with it, or no affidavit of merits. (See ante, p. 120.),If a bare affidavit of merits is served with the order,. we think it may be disregarded, as the Code requires an affidavit showing the grounds for the application (Code, Â§ 405), but if any grounds whatever are stated, the affi- davit and order are valid, no matter how frivolous the reasons assigned may be.,It will of course be understood that we are speaking throughout this article of orders granted by a judge out of court. The orders of the court lnust never ble disre- garded. There may be some doubt whether a justice of the Supreme Court, sitting in chambers in the city of New York, is not always "in court" (see Mlain v. Polce, 16 How. 272), but the form of the order will decide. If signed by the judge, it is his order out of court; if entitled in court, and signed by the clerk, it is the act of the court. As tile judge invariably signs such exlpartc orders him- self, the question is not likely to arise in actual practice.,Effect of the order on the defendant's case.]-By obtain- ing an extension of time to answer, whether by order or consent, the defendant waives his right to move for any correction of the complaint, unless such right be reserved to him in the order. (Bownma v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 662; Hollister v. Livin(iston, sp. t., 9 How. 140; Ishaml v. Wil- liantson, sp. t., 6 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 341.) An order or con- sent extending the defendant's time to answer, "or to make such application as he may be advised," saves to him the right of moving to correct the complaint in any manner. (Lackey v. Vandtrbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 159.),16,121
Extension of time to plead. When a demurrer will lie. There can be no doubt that the defendant, if he has been arrested, does not lose his right to move for his discharge upon any ground, by claiming an extension of time to answer (see Columbus Ins. Co. v. Force, sp.t., 8 How. 353), for the arrest has nothing to do with the summons or pleadings. (Corwin v. Freeland, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 560.),CHAPTER XLV1II. DESIMUREB TO COIMPLAINT. AnTICLE 1.

Effect of demurrer or omiss.ion to demur. ART. 1.-YWhen a demurrer will lie. A demurrer will lie only in the cases prescribed by the Code. (Rice v. O'Connor, 10 Abb. 362; Rightmyer v. HIas7ins, 9 How. 481; Manchester v. &torrs, sp. t., 3 How. 410; see WhVite v. Joy, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 90; Beale v. Hayes, 5 Sands. 640; Simpson v. Loft, sp. t., 8 How. 235.) A demurrer is allowable, therefore, only when it appears upon the filce of the complaint (Code, Â§ 144), without any reference to extrinsic matters (Scofield v. Van Sycl7d, 23 How. 97; Coo v. Beckwith, sp. t., 31 Barb. 339; 10 Abb. 296; 19 How. 398; Wilson v. Mayor of N. Y., 6 Abb. 6; 15 How. 500), either,,1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, or the subject of the action; or,,2. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue; or, 3. That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause; or, 122
When a demurrer will lie. Demurrer for want of jurisdiction. 4. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defend- ant; or,,5. That several causes of action have been improperly united; or,,6. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.,A demurrer will not lie for mere uncertainty of state- ment (Dagal v. Simlons, 23 N. Y. 491; People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433; Gra7anm v. C(ammanl , 5 )uer, 697; 13 How. 360), even where special damage is not averred with sufficient explicitness (Heivitt v. Mason, sp. t., 24 How. 366), nor for argumentativeness (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425; see Brown v. Richardson, 20 N. Y. 472), nor for redundant and irrelevant statements (Bishop v. EdImiston, 16 Abb., 466; Roeder v. Ormsby, sp. t., 13 Abb. 334; 22 How. 270; Watson v. Husson, 1 Duer, 242), nor for any other defect of form. (Prindle v. Ca- ruthers, 15 N. Y. 425, 431.) The demand of relief can in no ease afford a ground of demurrer. (See ante, p. 114; Bishop v. E.Edmisto, 16 Abb. 446.) An error merely and obviously clerical, will not sustain a demurrer. (Chamnberlin v. Kaylor, 2 E. D. Smith, 134; Fidcett v. Brice, sp. t., 22 How. 194.) Demurrer to part of conmlaint.]-A demurrer may be either to the whole complaint, or to any one of the causes of action stated therein. (Code, Â§ 145.) Prior to the enactment of this clause in 1849, it was held that no de- murrer would lie to part of a complaint. (Manchester v. Storrs, sp. t., 3 How. 410.) Though this is no longer the case, yet it is obvious that no demurrer will lie to part of a single cause of action. (See Cobb v. Frazee, sp. t., 4 How. 413.),ART. 2.-Demurrer for want of jurisdiction. The complaint is demurrable, if it shows that the court has no jurisdiction of' the person of the defendant, or of the subject of the action. (Code, Â§ 144.),123
For want of jurisdiction. For incapacity to sue. A demurrer will not lie on the ground that the court has not acquired jurisdiction, if it could acquire it, (Nonles v. Hope liMutual Ins. Co., 8 Barb. 541; 5 How. 96.),A complaint in a court of general jurisdiction is not demurrable for want of an averment of facts, the exist- ence of which may be necessary to give the court juris- diction. (Koenig v. Nott, 2 Hilt. 323; 8 Abb. 384.) Such a complaint is muobjectionable on this ground, unless it shows affirmatively that the court has not jurisdiction (ib.); but it is otherwise in an inferior court of special jurisdic- tion, such as the county courts (Frees v. Ford, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 176), or the city court of Brooklyn. (Simmons v. De Barre, 8 Abb. 269; 4 Bosw. 574.) ART. 3.-Delmurrer for want of capacity in plaintiff to suie.,The complaint is demurrable, if it shows that the plain- tiff has not legal capacity to sue. (Code, Â§ 144.),This is the proper ground of demurrer when it is sought to raise the objection that the plaintiff, using a corporate name, does not allege its incorporation (Connecticutt Bank v. Smith, sp. t., 9 Abb. 168; 17 How. 487; Bank of Low- ville v. Edwards, sp. t., 11 How. 216), if that objection can be raised by demurrer at all. (See Bank of Havana v. Magcc, 20 N. Y. 355.) It is also the proper mode of objec- tion where the plaintiff sues as an officer of an association, without showing his authority to sue as such (Myers v. Mlachado, sp. t., 6 Abb. 198; 14 How. 149), or where he sues as receiver, executor, &c., without averring his appointment as such. ART. 4.-Dcemurrer on grotund of another action pending. The complaint is demurrable, if it shows that there is another action pending, between the same parties, for the same cause (Code, Â§ 144), and in a court of this state (Williams v. Ayrault, 31 Barb. 364; Burrows v. Miller, sp. t., 5 How. 51; Walsh v. Durkin, 12 Johns. 99; Brown v. Jay, 9 id. 221; see Cook v. Litcificld, 5 Sands. 330), for 124
Another pending. For defect of parties. the pendency of another action in a court of another state or country, or even of the United States, is no ground of demurrer or defense. (lb.),A special proceeding is an action, within tie meaning of this section. (Groshton v. Lyon, 16 Barb. 461.) It is immaterial whether the other action is brought by the plaintiff or the defendant in the action in whicl the demurrer is raised (Iornfager v. Hornftager, sp. t., 6 How. 279), unless the plaintiff in the latter action could not, as defendant in the former, obtain all the relief as defendant which he can recover as plaintiff, in which case the pen- deucy of the former action is no defense.* (Haire v. Baker, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 357.),ART. 5.-Demeurrer for defect of parties. The complaint is demurrable if it appears by it that there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant (Code, Â§ 144), if the cause cannot be determined without pre- judice to their rights, nor by saving their rights (Wallace v. Eaton, sp. t., 5 how. 99.) Unless it appears by the complaint that the parties whose absence is objected to are living, no demurrer will lie on this ground. (Scofield v. Van Syckle, 23 How. 97; Brainard v. Jones, 11 IHow. 569; Burgess v. Abbott, [Ct. of Errors], 6 Hill, 135; aff'g S. 0., 1 id. 476.t) A demurrer vill not lie as a matter of course in every case in which an order might be obtained for the addition of parties under section 122. The parties omitted must * Such cases must be very rare under the Code. The case put in Ilaire v. Baker was one in which the defendant might have had full relief under the new system, though he could not, at the time the action of IIaire v. Baler was commenced. t In Zabriskie v. Smith (13 N. t. [3 Kern.] 322), the complaint did not ontain such an averment, yet the court, held that the objection might and hould have been taken by demurrer. Its attention does not, however, appear to have been called to this point.,125

For defect of parties. For misjoinder of-actions. be absolutely necessary, to justify a demurrer. (Perkins v. Church, sp. t., 31 Barb. 84.),A demurrer will not lie for an excess of parties, whether plaintiff (Peabody v. Washington Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 20 Barb. 339; People v. Mayor ofN. Y., sp. t., 28 Barb. 240; 8 Abb. 7; 17 How. 56; Gregory v. Oaksmith, sp. t., 12 How. 134), or defendant.* (N. Y. & N. Haven R. R. Co., v. Schuyler, 17 N. Y. 592; 7 Abb. 41; Churchill v. Trapp, 3 Abb. 306; Pinc7kney v. Wallace, 1 id. 82; Ashby v. Winston, 26 Mo. 210; see Stydam. v. Barber, 18 N. Y. 468,473; rev'g S. C., 6 Duer, 34.) In case of the misjoinder of parties, if no cause of action is stated against some of them, they alone should demur under subdivision 6 of section 144; or if separate causes of action are set up against distinct defendants, all may demur under sub- division 5.,No one can demur for defect of parties, unless his own interest requires that the parties lacking should le joined. (Hilllan v. HilHiant, 14 How. 456; Newcbould v. Warrin, sp. t., 14 Abb. 80.),ART. 6.-Demutrrer for 9misjoinlder of actions. The complaint is demurrable if it unites several causes of action which are not authorized by section 167 of the Code to be united in one complaint.t (Code, Â§144, as con- strued in Dorm an v. Kellam, 4 Abb. 202; 14 How. 184; Clheiwy v. Fiske, 22 How. 236.),This provision refers to claims for separate things, not to a claim for one thing upon various grounds (see P7il- lips v. Gorhanm, 17 N. Y. 270, 274), nor to a claim for several remedies for the plurose of finally obtaining a single thing. (Meyer v. Van Collem, 28 Barb. 230; 7 Abb. 222.) It relates to rights, and their infringement, not to * To the contrary, was Leavit v. Fisler, 4 Duer, 23. t As to what causes of action may or may not be joined, sec, ante, pp. 07 to 74. 126
Demurrer for misjoinder of actions. Demurrer for insufficiency. remedies. (Ib.) A complaint, therefore, which alleges but a single breach of duty by the defendant, cannot be demurred to under this subdivision of section 144, not- withstanding it claims several incongruous species of relief. (Ib.)* If in reality only one cause of action is stated, the complaint cannot be demurred to merely because it di- vides it into several distinct statements, each professing to be a separate cause of action. (Hilliman v. Hillnan, 14 How. 456.) A demurrer under this head should be to the whole complaint, and not to any separate part of it. (Ferris v. North American Fire Ins. Co., 1 Hill, 71.),ART. 7.-Delmurrer for ilsiffliciency. The complaint is demurrable, if it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action (Code, Â§ 144, subd. 6) in favor of the plaintiff (De Witt v. Chandler, 11 Abb. 459, 472; Palmer v. Sniedley, 28 Barb. 468; 6 Abb. 205) or one of the plaintiffs (Peabody v. Washington Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 20 Barb. 339; see ante, p. 126), against the defendant (De Witt v. Clutndler, supra), or some one of the defendants demurring jointly, for a joint demurrer cannot be sustained as to any of the defendants, if a cause of action is stated against any of them. (Woodbury v. Sadcrider, 2 Abb. 402; Peabody v. Washington Co. Mtt. Ins. Co., 20 Barb. 339; Eldridge v. Bell, sp. t., 12 How. 547 APillips v. Hagadton, sp. t., id. 17.) It is held that a complaint by husband and wife, for a cause of action belonging solely to the wife (Mann v. tf4sh, 35 Barb. 68; 21 How. 372; Ackley v. Tarbox, 29 Barb. 517), or a complaint against husband and wife, which states no cause of action against the latter, and demands no judgment against the former (Goodall v. * Mlaxwell v. Farnam (sp. t., 7 How. 236), to the contrary, was erro- neously decided. The remedy in that case should have been by motion.,127
Demurrer for insufficiency. When it lies. McAdarm, sp. t., 14 How. 385), is bad on demurrer, as to both husband and wife.,Against such a weight of authority, it may be deemed presumptuous in us to argue, but we cannot refrain from expressing our conviction that these decisions are erro- neous. They are founded upon old rules of pleading, which we consider to be entirely inapplicable under the present state of the law concerning married women, and entirely inconsistent with the decisions in Marquat v. Marquat (12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336), and Briis7kill v. James (11 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 294). In Rltsher v. Morris (sp. t., 9 How. 266*), a view contrary to the above cited decisions was taken, the court going so far as to hold that the joinder of husband and wife was proper; but this is not necessary to be maintained.,The only question raised by a demurrer under this sub- division i,, whether a cause of action is stated. If there is, it is immaterial how vaguely or defectively it is set forth. The demurrer cannot be sustained if, taking all the facts alleged together, any cause of action appears to exist in favor of the plaintiff (Prindle v. Carutlters, 15 N. Y. 425; People v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 433; Grah7a v. Cammann, 5 Duer, 697; 13 How. 360; Richards v. Edickt, sp. t., 17 Barb. 260); and this even though the complaint should be so confused and crude in its compo- sition that no connected statement of a cause of action can be found in it (People v. Mayor of 1N. Y., sp. t., 28 Barb. 240; 8 Abb. 7; 17 How. 56); and even though only a mere fragment of the cause of action which the plaintiff supposed himself to have, remains. (See Roeder v. Ormsby, sp. t., 13 Abb. 334; 22 How. 270; Jacques v. Morris, sp. t., 2 E. D. Smith, 639.),* Affirmed at general term (9 Hlow. 282), but no opinion published. The affirmance may have been on the ground that the demurrer, being for " defect of parties," could not be sustained for that reason, there being only an excess of parties. 128
Demurrer for insufficiency. Form of demurrer. The demurrer must be overruled, if the complaint can be sustained in any aspect or upon any theory of law (Nrewbery v. Garland, 31 Barb. 121, 127), even though the theory upon which it is supported is entirely different from that which presented itself to the mind of the pleader (see Wright v. Hooker, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 51; Boeder v. Ormsby, sp. t., 13 Abb. 334; 22 How. 270); and so if the plaintiff is entitled to any relief, although not to all the relief demanded (Meyer v. Van Collemn, 28 Barb. 230; 7 Abb. 222; and cases cited, ante, p. 114), nor to any part thereof.* (See Stluyvesant v. Mayor of N. Y., 11 Paige, 414.),A demurrer cannot be founded upon a merely descrip- tive allegation of the complaint, to which the plaintiff would not be bound to adhere at the trial. Thus if an act, generally lawful, is alleged to have been performed at a certain time, the defendant cannot, on demurrer, raise the objection that such acts were, at that time, pro- hibited by law. (Amory v. M'Gregor, 12 Johns. 287.),ART. 8.-Form of demurrer. A pleading, professing to be a demurrer, which contro- verts any allegation of the complaint, is substantially an answer, and is treated as such (Clark v. Van Deusen, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 219); and so if it sets up any new matter. (Struver v. Ocean Ins. Co., sp. t., 16 How. 422.),Specifceation of objection.]-The demurrer must dis- tinctly specify the grounds of objection to the complaint, and unless it does so, may be disregarded. (Code, Â§ 145.),It must specify one of the six grounds of objection allowed by the Code (Harper v. Chamnberlain, sp. t., 11 Abb. 234), and this, it would seem, in language similar * To the contrary is WVallo v. Ttllon, (sp. t., 32 Barb. 203; 20 How. 347), S. 0., sub nom. Anon. (sp. t., 11 Abb. 231), erroneously decided, as we think.,17,129
Form of demurrer. Specification of objection. Erroneous specification. or fully equivalent to that of the Code itself. (Ib.; see White v. Low, sp. t., 7 Barb. 204.),Thus, a demurrer, merely pointing out various allega- tions which it claims ought to be in the complaint, does not raise the objection that the facts stated do not con. stitute a cause of action (Harper v. Clhanberlain, supra), and a demurrer, objecting simply that the plaintiff shows that he has no title to the note sued upon, does not raise any question as to the sufficiency of a statement of the plaintiff's appointment as receiver. (Wh7ite v. Low, supra.),A specification, in the precise words of subdivision 6, tlhat the complaint does not state facts sufficient to con- stitute a cause of action," is sufficient to raise that objec- tion, without setting forth any details of defects in the complaint. (Haire v. Baker, 5 N. Y, [1 Seld.] 357; Paine v. Smith, 2 Duer, 298; White v. Brown, sp. t., 14 How. 282; Getty v. Hudson River R. R. Co., sp. t., 8 id. 177; Jo7hnson v. W.etmore, sp. t., 12 Barb. 433; Hyde v. Conlrad, sp. t., 5 How. 112; Durkee v. Saratoga: Wash. R. R. Co., sp. t., 4 id. 226; Swift v. De Witt, sp. t., 3 id. 280.*) So an objection in the mere words of subdivision two is suffi- cient. (Huilbert v. Young, 13 How. 413.) And so in a demurrer under any other subdivision (Getty v. Hutdson River R. R. Co., sp. t., 8 How. 177; see Hairc v. Baker, supra), except that under subdivision one it must be stated whether the objection is to the want of jurisdiction of the person, or of the action (Getty v. IHudson River R. R. Co., supra), and under subdivision four it must be stated whether the defect is in the parties plaintiff, or the parties defendant (ib.), and the names of the parties wanting must be stated. (Skinner v. Stuart, sp. t., 13 Abb. 442.),Effect of erroneous slpecification.]-A demurrer cannot be sustained upon any other ground than that which is specified in it. (Wilson v. Mayor of N. Y., 6 Abb. 6; 15,* Some cases to the contrary are cited in 4 Abb. Digest, 482. 130
Form of demurrer. Specification of defects and part demurred to. How. 500; Hobart or Viburt v. Frost, 5 Duer, 672; 3 Abb. 119; Cook v. Chlse, 3 Duer, 643.),Where the demurrer alleges that the complaint does not state a cause of action "in this, that," &c., giving details of the objection, it has been held that no objec- tions would be considered that were not specified. (Nellis v. De Forest, 16 Barb. 61.) This decision is perhaps scarcely consistent with Haire v. Baker, and the other cases cited. Rentedy against error.]-If the demurrer specifies ab- solutely no ground of objection whatever, the plaintiff may return it to the defendant's attorney, with a state- ment of the defect, and enter judgment as upon failure to answer. But if the demurrer specifies any objection, however unwarranted, the only remedy is by motion for judgment under section 247. Such is our construction of section 145.,Specification of part demurred to.]-The demurrer may be taken to the whole complaint, or to any of the causes of action. (Code, Â§ 145.) But it must specify the parts of the complaint demurred to, or it will be regarded as addressed to the whole complaint; and if any one cause of action is sufficiently stated, the demurrer must be overruled. (Sheldon v. Hoy, 11 How. 11, 16; Boeder v. Ormsby, sp. t., 13 How. 334; 22 lIow. 270; Martin v. Mattison, sp. t., 8 Abb. 3;* Butler v. Wood, sp. t., 10 How. 222; Jaques v. Morris, sp. t., 2 E. D. Smith, 339; Freeland v. IColloutgh, 1 Denio, 414; People v. Bartow, 6 Cow. 290.) A demurrer, however, is to be liberally construed (Mat- thetus v. Beach, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 173), and though it begins in form as to the whole complaint, yet. if it sets out a single cause of action therein, and confines its,* Affirmed at general term.,1_1,131

(Code, Â§ 172.),Demurrer overruled.]-After a demurrer has been over- ruled, the court may, if it has been interposed in good faith, permit the demurrant to plead over, on such terms as may be just. (Code, Â§ 172.),If the demurrant avails himself of such leave to answer, he thereby abandons the demurrer, and cannot afterwards object that it was erroneously overruled. (Brown v. Saratoga &c. . . . Co., 18 N. Y. 495.),ART. 10.-Effect of demurrer or omission to demur. Demurrer.]-A demurrer, so long as it stands upon the record, amounts to an admission, for all purposes of the action, of the cause of action demurred to, and of all the facts included in the statement thereof (Cutler v. Wright, 22 N. Y. 472); but does not admit the truth or justice of mere conclusions of law. (City of Buffalo v. Hollowvay, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 493; Hall v. Bartlett, sp. t., 9 Barb. 297.),Omission to demur.]-By omitting to demur, the defend- ant waives all objections which might be raised by demurrer, except the want of jurisdiction in the court, and the want of any statement of a cause of action in the complaint. (Code, Â§ 148, as construed in Zabriskie v. Smnith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 322; Dennison v. Dennison, 9 How. 246.) Such objections cannot be raised by answer (lb.;,133

Counterclaim. 4. Several defenses. ArT. 1.-What defenses are allowed. We do not propose to attempt here a statement of all the defenses which may be set up in the various species of actions, but only to point out the changes effected hy the Code in this respect.,The defendant is at liberty to show that the statements of the complaint are untrue, or that the plaintiffs claim has been discharged, or the remedy thereon suspended, either in whole or in part, or that he is entitled to recover something himself in the action, against the plaintiff.,Equitable defenses may now be set up in every kind of action, whether heretofore called legal or equitable. (Blair v. Claxton, 18 N.Y. 529; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Pro. Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 85; Crary v. Goodmlan, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 266; Dobson v. Pearce, id. 156; 1 Abb. 97.),Any of the objections upon which a demurrer may be founded, when appearing upon the face of the complaint, may, when not thus apparent, be raised by answer (Code,,* There are many similar decisions, which it seems useless to cite. 134
What defenses are allowed. Recoupment and set-off. Â§ 147); and if 'not thus raised, all such objections, except as to the jurisdiction of the court, and the absence of a cause of action in the complaint, are waived. (Code, Â§ 148.) A defense which did not exist at the commencement of the action may be set up, if existing at the time of answering. (Willis v. Chii1p, sp. t., 9 How. 568.) Recollpment and set-off.]-The defenses which were available before the Code by way of recoupment or set- off,* are still available as such, whether the action is brought by the original creditor, or by his assignee. (Western Bank v. Sherwood, 29 Barb. 383.) When set up against the original creditor himself, such defenses fall under the head of counterclaims (Lemon v. Trull, 13 How. 248 t); but when set up against his assignee, they are not counterclaims. (Vassear v. Livingston, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 248; aff'g S. 0., 4 Duer, 285.),Whether, in an action by an assignee, any demand which the defendant could set up as a cotfnterclaim, in an action brought by the assignor, but which could not have been set up by way of recoupment or set-off before the Code, may now be made available as a set-off against the assignee, is a question that does not appear to have been decided. We think that it may. The right of recoup- ment against the assignee was an equitable right, created by analogy to the law, and now that such rights are extended against the assignor, they should by the same analogy be extended in proportionate degree as against the assignee. Action removed from justice's co2rt.]-In an action re- moved from a justice's court into a court of record, upon * For the statute of set-os; sec 3 R S.

What defenses are allowed. Partial defenses. Counterclaim. a plea of title, the answer cannot set up any other defense than that which was pleaded before the justice (Code, Â§ 60), but it may state such defense in different language (Ct. of Appeals, Wiggins v. Tallmadge, 7 How. 404), and may abandon part of it. (Ib.),ART. 2.-Partial defenses. Partial defenses not only may (Loosey v. Orser, 4 Bosw. 391; Ross v. Longmunlir, 15 Abb. 326; Hounghton v. Towti- send, 8 How. 441; Willis v. Taggard, sp. t., 6 id. 433), but must be pleaded. (ilKyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297.),But as nothing is a defense which does not go to the cause of action, matter merely in mitigation of damages cannot be pleaded in an action for unliquidated damages (Barnes v. Willett, 12 Abb. 448; 35 Barb. 514; Blarter v. Crill, 33 id. 284; Saltus v. Kip, 5 Duer, 646; 12 How. 343; 2 Abb. 383; Gilbert v. Rounds, 14 How. 46; Van Benschoten v. Yat7e, sp. t., 13 id. 97; Sm ilt v. Waite, sp. t., 7 id. 227; Rosenthtal v. Brush, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 228; but see contra, Soland v. Johnson, 16 Abb. 235), except in an action for libel or slander, in which it may either with or without a justification (Code, Â§ 165; Butsh v. Prosser, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 347; Van Benschotcn v. Yaple, supra), or any other issue. (See ib.),ART. 3.-Counterclaim. The counterclaim is a creation of the Code, which in- cludes the former defenses of set-off and recoupment, when set up against the original creditor (Pattison v. Riclurds, 22 Barb. 143), but which enlarges very mate- rially the power of the defendant to interpose affirmative defenses.,There are two species of counterclaims,-one which be set up in any action whatever, and another which can may be pleaded only in an action arising upon contract. These we shall consider separately. 136
Connterclaim. What may be set up. In all actions. In all actions.]-In an action of any description, whether on contract or tort (Xenia Bank v. Lee, 2 Bosw. 694; 7 Abb. 372; Brown v. B2C7ciblghami, sp. t., 11 Abb. 387; 21 How. 190; see Blair v. Claxton, 18 N. Y. 529; Bartlett v. Jtdd, 23 Barb. 262; Stone v. Sprague, 20 id. 509), any defendant may set up, as a counterclaim against any one of the plaintiffs between whom and himself a several judgment might be had in the action* (Code, Â§ 150; Briggs v. Briggs, 20 Barb. 477; Newell v. Salmons, 22 id. 647; Parsons v. Nash, sp. t., 8 How. 454), any claim existing in favor of such defendant (Code, Â§ 150), against such plaintiff (ib.; V-ssear v. Livingstoin, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 248; aff'g S. 0., 4 Duer, 285); and of which such defend- ant is the owner (Lafarge v. Eelsey, 1 Bosw. 171; Belknap Z'Inttyre, sp. t., 2 Abb. 466), at the commencement of the action (Cha'nbers v. Lewis, 11 Abb. 210 ;f Fan Yalen v. Laphlam, 13 How. 240); as well as at the time of answer- ing (Dendy v. Powell, 3 IMees. & W. 442); provided such claim is founded upon a cause of action arising out of the contract or transaetioni set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject of the action. (Code, Â§ 150.) In actions utpon contract.]-In an action arising on con- tract, in addition to the counterclaim before described, a defendant may set up any other cause of action arising * As to this point, see post, chap. cviii. t There is confessedly much doubt as to the correctness of this judicial addition to the Code. Why should not the defendant be allowed (in the elear absence of statutory prohibition), to interpose any defense he may have, and not merely such as he lad at the commencement of the action ? The plaintiff can be protected against an unfair imposition of costs, by leave to discontinue without costs. The judgment was affirmed on other grounds in the Court of Appeals (LS Abb. 433).,As to the meaning of " transaction," see LBarhyte v. Hughcs (33 Barb. 320).,18,137
Counterclaim. In actions upon contract. General rules. on contract (Code, Â§ 150) existing against a plaintiff(Code, Â§ 150) between whom and such defendant a several judgment might be had in the action (Id.), and owned by such defendant at the commencement of the action (Chambers v. Lewis, 11 Abb. 210; Van Valen v. Lapham, 13 How. 240), as well as at the time of pleading it (Dendy v. lPowell, 3 Mees. & W. 442), and due at the former as well as at the latter period. (Rice v. O'Conlor, 10 Abb. 362.),If in any case a defendant can be permitted to waive a tort, and set up a counterclaim upon an implied con. tract arising out of a transaction really tortious, which has been doubted (Mayor of N. Y. v. Parker Vein Co., 12 Abb. 300; 21 How. 289), it is essential that such a counterclaim should be pleaded in form as upon contract, without reference to the tort. (Ib.; Chambers v. Lewis, 11 Abb. 210; Piser v. Stearns, 1 Hilt. 86.),An action to redeem a mortgage has been held not to arise on contract (Burns v. Nevins, 27 Barb. 493; see Burke v. Nichols, 34 id. 430); and it is even said that no action for merely equitable relief is an action arising upon con- tract (Burns v. Nevins, supra); but, with all respect, we must entirely dissent from this construction of the lan- guage of the Code. (Compare National Fire Ins. Co. v. M'cKay, 21 N. Y. 191.),General rules concerning cotunterclaimts.]-It is not necessary in any case that the counterclaim should be for merely liquidated damages (Sc7hubart v. Harteat, 34 Barb. 447; Beardsley v. Stover, sp. t., 7 How. 294; see Rogers v. Ostrom, 35 Barb. 523), nor even for money only (Gage v. Angell, sp. t., 8 How. 335*; see Knowltol v. * The diclum to the contrary in De Leyer v. Mfichaels, (5 Abb. 203) is clearly unwarrantable, though strongly supported by the decision in Ives v. Miller (19 Barb. 196), in which Gage v. Angel2 is disapproved.
Counterclaim. Gennra! rules concerning counterclaims.,---- - _--- - Mickles, 29 Barb. 465; Bartlett v. Judd, 21 N. Y. 200; 23 Barb. 262; Stone v. Sprague, 20 id. 509;) and it may be founded upon legal or equitable grounds, and demand either or both species of relief. (Ib.; Code, Â§ 150.),A counterclaim must operate in some way to defeat, in whole or in part, the plaintiff's claim in the action, or it will be inadmissible. (National Fire Ins. Co. v. McKay, 21 N. Y. 191; Mattoon v. Baker, 24 How. 329.) Nothing is a counterclaim which could not be made the foundation of an independent action against the plaintiff. (Â¥assear v. Livingston, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 248; see Merrick v. Gordon, 20 N. Y. 93.) Therefore, in an ac- tion by the assignee of a claim, a debt due to the defend- ant from the assignor cannot be a counterclaim, though it is, under certain circumstances, a valid defense. (Ib.; Dtincan v. Stanton, 30 Barb. 533; Spencer v. Babcock, 22 Barb. 326; Weeks v. Pryor, sp. t., 27 id. 79; Dillaye v. Niles, sp. t., 4 Abb. 253; Ferreira \. Depew, sp. t., id. 131; Wolf v. H., sp. t., 13 How. 84; see Reed v. Latson, 15 Barb. 9.) So in an action by a mortgagee of chattels, for their possession, a lien existing against the mortgagor cannot be set up as a counterclaim. (Bissell v. Pearse, 21 How. 130.) So in an action by a receiver, a demand against the person of whose estate he is receiver, cannot be counterclaimed. (Tyler v. Willis or Whitney, 33 Barb. 327; 12 Abb. 465; see U. S. Trust Co. v. Harris, 2 Bosw. 75.) And in an action by a corporation as such, a demand against even all its members, as individuals, cannot be counterclaimed. (N. Y. Ice Co. v. Parker, 21 How. 302.) And a debt due from the plaintiff, which it has been agreed shall be applied in payment of his claim, though a good ground of defense, cannot be set up as a counter- claim, even against the original creditor. (Davidson v. Renington, sp. t., 12 How. 310.) Nothing can be set up as a counterclaim which cannot be decided without bringing new parties into the action,,139
Counterclaim. General rules. Examples. not necessary to the determination of the plaintiff's case. (Cummings v. Morris, 25 N. Y. 625; Coursen v. Hamlin, 2 Duer, 513.),Where several defendants are sued upon a liability strictly joint (e. g., as partners), a debt due to one of them alone cannot be set up as a counterclaim. (Hurlbut v. Post, 1 Bosw. 38; Peabody v. Bloomer, 3 Abb. 353; 6 Duer, 53; Pinckney v. Keyler, 4 E. D. Smith, 469.) But in an action between part owners of a vessel, for contribu. tion, the defendant may counterclaim an aliquot part of a demand due him from the plaintiff and other part owners. (See Wood v. Merritt, 2 Bosw. 368.),A defendant against whom no personal claim is made cannot set up a counterclaim. (National Fire Ins. Co. v. MtKay, 21 N. Y. 191.),The pendency of an action for a claim is no bar to the set- ting up of that claim as a counterclaim in another action (Wiltsie v. Nortl7am, 3 Bosw. 162; Fuller v. Read, 15 How. 236; Naylor v. Sctenck, 3 E. D. Smith, 135); nor will the defendant be required, before trial, to elect between his counterclaim and his action. (Fuller v. Read, supra.),The defendant is in no case bound to set up a countr claim, and is not barred from bringing an action upoli any demand which he may have, by omitting to set it up as a counterclaim. (Ialsey v. Carter, 1 Dter, 667; Sieman v. Austin, 33 Barb. 9; Ligqnot v. Redding, 4 E. D. Smith, 285; Welch v. Hazelton, sp. t., 14 How. 97; see Gillespie v. Torrance, 25 N. Y. 306, 310.),Elxamples.]-In an action for rent, the defendant may counterclaim any damages which he has suffered by rea- son of a violation of the plaintiff's agreement (Rogers v. Ostrom, 35 Barb. 523); and so le may in an action for the land upon non-payment of rent, the amount of rent due being material in such case (Blair v. Claxton, 18 N. Y. 529); but he cannot counterclaim damages occasioned by a mere trespass or act of negligence by which the 140
Counterclaim. Examples. plaintiff has injured the premises (Edgerton v. Page, 20 N. Y. 281; 10 Abb. 119; aff'g S. C., 1 Hilt. 320; 14 How. 116; Mayor of N. Y. v. Parker Veil Co., 12 Abb. 300; 21 How. 289; Drake v. Cockroft, 4 E. D. Smith, 24; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377), or has injured or converted to his own use property thereon belonging to the defendant (Mayor of N. Y. v. Parker Yein Co.. 12 Abb. 300; 21 How. 289; fMKiensie v. Farrell, 4 Bosw. 192), for neither the premnises nor the property thereon are the subject of the action. In an action for goods sold, a counterclaim for other goods, wrongfully detained (Piser v. Stearns, 1 Hilt. 86), or for fraud concerning other goods (Berdel'v. Johnsoln, 18 Barb. 559), is inadmissible. In an action on contract, the defendant may counter- claim damages for the breach of a covenant to submit the matters upon which the action is brought to arbitration. (Curtis v. Barnes, 30 Barb. 225.) In an action on an award, the defendant may, on a statement of facts which would justify such a judgment in an action for the purpose, have the award set aside. l(Knowlton v. Mickles, 29 Barb. 465.) In an action against a surety, he may set up as a coun- terclaim that the plaintiff is possessed of securities for the debt to which he ought to be subrogated, and may demand the delivery of such securities to himself, upon payment of the debt. (Bank of Toronto v. Hunter, sp. t., 4 Bosw. 646; 20 How. 292.) Ajudgment may be set up as a counterclaim, without regard to the restrictions of Â§ 71 of the Code. Setting it up as a counterclaim is not bringing an action upon it, within the meaning of that section. (Clark v. Story, 29 Barb. 295; Wells v. He)tshaw, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 625.) It has been held (by two judges against one), that in a action to redeem premises mortgaged, the defendant cannot set up as a counterclaim an agreement to sell the,141
Counterclaim. Examples. premises to him, and demand a specific performance thereof. (Burns v. Nevins, 27 Barb. 493.) But we doubt the justice of this decision, especially under the circun. stances of that case, and this not only for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion, but because the action seems to us founded upon contract.,In an action for land, the defendant may set up, by way of counterclaim, that by a mistake in a deed from the plaintiff to him such land was omitted, and may de- mand judgment for a reformation of such deed. (Bartlett v. Judd, 21 N. Y. 200; 23 Barb. 262; Stone v. Sprague, 20 Barb. 509.),In an action for divorce, on the ground of adultery, the defendant cannot set up cruel and inhuman treatment, or abandonment, either as a defense or a counterclaim (6riiffn v. Griffin, 23 How. 183; Diddell v. Diddell, sp. t., 3 Abb. 167), and the rule is the same in an action To declare a marriage null. (HIumphlrecy v. Williams, 6 Jur. [N. S.] 151; 30 L. J. [Mlat. C.] 62.) Neither in an action for di. vorce, on the ground of cruelty, &c., can the defendant set up adultery by the plaintiffi (Henry! v. Henry, sp. t., 17 Abb. ; 27 How. 5.) It has been held that he may set up misconduct on the part of the plaintiff vhich would entitle him to the same relief which she asks. (J. W. B. v. F. D. B., 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 350.) A contrary decision has, however, been recently made. (R. F. . v. S. H., 40 Barb. 9.),In an action for a wrongful act, another wrong not connected with the act or transaction sued upon cannot be set up as a counterclaim. (Iurden v. Prinment, 1 Hilt. 75; Pattison v. Richards, 22 Barb. 143; Fellerman v. Dolan, sp. t., 7 Abb., 395 n.),In an action for an assault, the defendant cannot set up, by way of counterclaim, an assault committed by the plaintiff upon him, even though both assaults occurred in the course of one affray. (Barhyte v. Hughes, 33 Barb. 320; Schiaderbeek v. Worth, sp. t., 8 Abb. 37.) 142
1,Counterolaims. Several defenses. When allowed. In an action for the conversion of a ring, it was held, with some hesitation, that the defendant could not coun- terclaim the value of a ring which he had exclhanrd with the plaintiff, for the ring sued for under an agreement for a mutual return of rings at any time, which the plaintiff had refused to carry out. (Askins v. learns, sp. t., 3 Abb. 184.) In an action for chattels, an answer, setting up a lien thereon, with a demand for their return, and damages for their detention, is only a defense and not a counterclaim. (De Leyer v. fichaels, 5 Abb. 203; Gottler v. Babcock, sp. t., 7 id. 392 n.),ART. 4.-Several Defenses. What are.]-Several denials constitute only one defense. Otis v. Ross, 8 How. 193.) And so do the denial of part of a single cause of action, and a plea of tender as to the balance. (Spencer v. Tooker, sp. t., 12 Abb. 353; 21 How. 333.) And it has been held that several cross demands, pleaded by way of set off' to a single cause of action, con- stitute but a single defense (Ralnney v. Snith, sp. t., 6 How. 420), but the soundness of this doctrine may be doubted. When alloed(l.]-The defendant may set up in his answer as many defenses as he may have, whether legal or equitable, or both. (Code, Â§ 150.) The old rule that matter in avoidance could not be pleaded without confessing that, but for such matter, the action might be sustained (Brown) v. Artcher, 1 Hill, 266), and which consequently forbade the union of a general de- nial with a plea in avoidance (Stephen PI. 200), is abro- gated by the Code.* (Hackley v. Oymlwi, 10 How. 44; Ketchean v. Zerega, 1 E. D. Smith, 553; Hollenbeck v. Clow, sp. t., 9 How. 289.) * The cases to the contrary (Anibal v. Hunier, sp. t., 6 How. 255; see itJtrray v. Gifford, sp. t., 5 id. 14; Schneider v. Schultz, 4 Sands. 664; Arthur v. Brooks, 14 Barb. 533; Roe v. Rogers, sp. t., 8 How. 356) are not bbe regarded as of any authority on this point.,143
Several defenses. Inconsistent defenses. How to be pleaded. The answer may, therefore, deny an allegation of the complaint in one defense, and set up new matter in avoidance thereof in another. (Ib.; Ormnslb v. Douglass, 5 Duer, 665 ;* Townsend v. Platt, sp. t., 3 Abb. 325.),Iiwonsistent defenses.]-No objection can be made to one of several defenses in an answer, on the mere ground that it is inconsistent with another (Smith v. Wells, sp. t., 20 How. 158; Buhler v. Wcntwortth, 17 Barb. 649; 9 How. 282; Stiles v. Comstock, sp. t., id. 48; Ostrom v. Bixby, sp. t., id. 57; Hollenbeek v. Clow, sp. t. id. 289; Anon., 1 Code Rep. 134f); nor merely because one of the defenses can be material only in case the other proves to be untrue. (Mott v. Burnett, 2 E. D. Smith, 50; see Otis v. Ross, 8 How. 193.) But each defense must be consistent in itself. (Buddington v. Davis, sp. t., 6 How. 401; Porter v. M'Cree(dy, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 8S.),If defenses are so plainly contradictory that it is im- possible for both of them to be true, and if the state. ments made in one are sufficient to establish the falsity of another, that is undoubtedly a good ground for strik- ing out such defense as sham. (See Hollenbeck v. Clor, sp. t., 9 How. 289; Roe v. Rogers, sp. t., 8 id. 356.),Matter in abatement and ini bar.]-Defenses in abate- ment and in bar of the action may be united in one answer (Swieet v. Tuttle, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 465; aff'g S. C., 10 How. 40; Gardner v. Clark, 21 N. Y. 399k), and must be, for the Code authorizes but one answer by any one defendant. (Ib.),How to be pleaded.]-Each defense must be separately stated (Code, Â§ 150), and plainly numbered (Rule 19, Sic- * To the contrary was a former decision in S. C., 2 Abb. 407. t To the contrary were Lewis v. Acker (sp. t., 11 How. 163); LivinigsO v. Harrison (2 E. D. Smith, 197).,t Overruling S. C., 6 How. 449. 144

Seymour, sp. t., 6 id. 298*); and must intelligibly refer to the cause of action to which it is addressed. (Code, Â§ 150.) *,Each defense independent.]-Each defense must be com- plete in itself, and stand upon its own merits, without regard to any other defenses in the same answer (Loosey v. Orser, 4 Bosw. 391; Xeinia Bank v. Lee, 2 Bosw. 694; 7 Abb. 372; Spencer v. Babcock, 22 Barb. 326); and upon demurrer its defects will not be cured by reference to other defenses (ib.), unless such reference is expressly made by the answer itself, as where, to avoid useless repetition, a fact stated in one defense is referred to in, and made part of, a subsequent defense, which is, in our view, clearly admissible. (See Xenia Bank v. Lee, supra; Ayrault v. Chamberlaiin, 33 Barb. 238.) Where the defenses are really distinct, they are to be considered without any reference to each other, and a tacit admission in one will not preclude the defendant from availing himself of a denial of the same fact in another. (Swift v. Kingsley, 24 Barb. 541.) Nor, upon demurrer to one defense, can another be referred to for the purpose of curing defects in the complaint. (Ayres v. Covill, 18 Barb. 260.) But when it is obvious that two defenses, in form distinct, are in reality the same in substance, one may be regarded and construed as a mere amplification of the other. (Ryle v. Harrington, sp. t., 4 Abb. 421; 14 How. 59.) And when several defenses are treated as one upon the trial, without objection or surprise, they should be so regarded after verdict. (Ayrault v. Chamnberlain, 33 Barb. 238.),In Bridge v. Payson (5 Sands. 210), an objection on this ground was rised at the trial, and properly overruled there. The remedy is by motion Htly, before answering.,19,145

Form of denial in general. 6. Denial of knowledge or information. 7. Allegations of new matter. ART. 1.-Form and contents of the answer. The answer must contain, 1. A denial of the allegations of the complaint; 2. A statement of any new matter constituting a de- sense or counterclaim. (Code, Â§ 149.),Though the Code does not expressly authorize the insertion of matter in the answer relating merely to the mutual rights of co-defendants, and though it is not allowable to serve an answer consisting exclusively of such matter (Woodworth v. Bellows, sp. t., 4 How. 24; see Code, Â§ 153), yet where a sufficient defense is raised, the principles upon which judgment is rendered (see post, chap. cviii.) seem to make it proper for the answer also to state any facts upon which relief against a co-defendant is intended to be asked. (See Norbury v. Seeley, sp. t., 4 How. 73.),Title.]-It is not absolutely necessary that the answer should be entitled in the cause, but as it must, in some way, show to what action it refers, there is no method so convenient as the insertion of a brief title. In such title it is not necessary, for any purpose, to give the names of all the parties, nor to state the county of trial. 146,THE ANSWEE.

Second: For a second defense:,I. ........................ II ........................ III. ........................,THOMAS DARLINGTON.,Defendant's Attorney. ART. 2.-To what the answer should be addressed. Generally.]-The answer must be addressed to the com- plaint, and not to the bill- of particulars, if any there is. (Kreiss v. Seligman, sp. t., 8 Barb. 440; 5 How. 425; Dib- ble v. Kempshall, 2 Hill, 124; see Scovell v. Howell, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 33; Anon., 19 Wend. 226.) And it may be addressed to the complaint as served, without regard to the original on file. (See Trowbridge v. Didier, 4 Duer, 448.) To part of the complaint.]-In pleading a defense to a part of the complaint only, it was a rule of the former system that such defense must be stated to be addressed only to such part of the complaint, or it would be regarded as intended for an answer to the whole, and, therefore, bad. (Nichols v. Dusenbury, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 583; Sos- ter v. Hazen, 12 Barb. 547.) This rule is still in force
under the Code. (Loveland v. Hosner, sp. t., 8 How. 215; Thumb v. Walrath, sp. t., 6 id. 196; see Kieedler v. Stern bergh, sp. t., 10 id. 67 ; Code, Â§ 150.),The best plan of referring to a particular cause of action in the complaint is to specify its number, as " the first cause," &c., but any other mode of doing so, which accomplishes the purpose, is sufficient on demurrer.

The defendant may demur to one or more of several causes of action stated in the complaint, and answer the residue (Code, 5 151); and this whether such causes of action are separately stated, or not. (Clarkison v. Mitctell, 3 E. D. Smith, 269.),He cannot, however, demur and answer, at the same time, to a single cause of action (Ingra7lam v. Baldiin, 12 Barb. 9 ;* Gassett v. Croc7;er, sp. t. 10 Abb. 133; Strn- ver v. Ocean Ins. Co., sp. t., 16 How. 422; Munn v. Bar- num, sp. t., 12 id. 563; 1 Abb. 281; Spellman v. Veeider, sp. t., 5 How. 5; Slocum v. Wheeler, sp. t., 4 id. 373); and if he does, the demurrer may be struck out on motion (Gassett v. Crocker, Slocum v. Wheeler, supra), or disregarded on the trial (Ingralamn v. Baldwiin, su- pra), or the defendant may be required to elect between the pleadings. (Strtver v. Ocean Ins. Co.; Mann v. Bar- gtum, supra.),ART. 4.-What imay be denied. Any material allegation in the complaint may be denied by the answer. (Code, Â§ 149.),Not only direct allegations, but also all material facts impliedly averred, may be denied. (Bellinger v. Craigue, 31 Barb. 534; lHaight v. Iolley, 3 Wend. 263; Marstol,* Affirmed, without discussing this point, 9 N. Y. [5 Scld.] 45. 148,THE ANSWER.
v. Allen, 8 Mees. & W. 494; see Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425.) Imlmaterial allegations.]-The defendant is not at lib- erty to take issue upon any allegation which is immaterial, no matter how explicitly averred by the complaint. (Fril v. BeC)Iett, 5 Sands. 54; Code Rep., N. S. 38.) Thus, where no demand before suit was necessary to maintain the plaintiff's case, but such demand is alleged in the com- plaint, an answer merely denying that such demand was made is frivolous. (Fairchild v. Ogdensburgh &c., R. R. Co., 15 N. Y. 337.) So where the complaint alleged an offer on the part of the plaintiff, which was not necessary to be made, a denial of such offer was held bad. (Wallis v. Warren, 4 Exch. 364.) So in an action against the in- dorser of a note, though the complaint avers that the note was made by the person whose name is signed thereto, and indorsed by certain earlier indorsers, the answer can- not take issue upon any of such averments. (M'Gregor v. Blides, 6 El. & Bl. 266.) The averment of the plaintiff's belief of the facts which he asserts, is of course not a matter for denial. (Patterson v. Caldwell, 1 Mete. Ky. 492; Walters v. Chinn, id. 502; see Radway v. Matiter, 5 Sands. 654.) Time, place, &c.]-A denial of the time or place at which an act is alleged to have been done, is clearly frivo- lous, in all cases in which such time or place is not of the substance of the action. (Iivingston v. Hammer, 7 Bosw. 670; Davison v. Powell, 16 How. 467; see Baler v. Bailey, 16 Barb. 54; Salinger v. Lusk, sp. t., 7 How. 430.) Valhe.]-The alleged value of property, in an action either for recovery of its possession or of damages for its conversion, is not a matter for denial (Woodrutff v. Cook, 25 Barb. 505; Cornoss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 314), it being in such case a merely descriptive allegation, not,149 THE ANSWER.
admitted by not denying it.* (Ib.; M'Kensie v. Farrell, 4 Bosw. 202.) But in an action for the price of goods (Greg. ory v. Wright, sp. t., 11 Abb. 417), or a compensation for services, upon a quantum meruit, no express agreement being alleged as to price, their value is a proper subject of issue. (Ib.; see Mosset v. Sackett, 18 N. Y. 522.),Damages.]-Allegations of damage, in actions for un- liquidated damages, cannot be made the subject of an issue. (Hackett v. Richards, 3 E. D. Smith, 13, 31.),Matter in aggravationj.]-Allegations not essential to the plaintiff's cause, but pleaded in mere aggravation of damages, are not issuable. (Gilbert v. Rounds, 14 How. 46; Lane v. Gilbert, sp. t., 9 id. 150.) Thus in an action for an assault, the answer cannot take issue upon facts alleged by the complaint in aggravation of the injury (ib.); and a denial that the injury was of the nature or extent stated in the complaint, is frivolous. (Sclatder- beck v. Worth, sp. t., 8 Abb. 37.) So in an action for libel, actionable on its face, the allegations of the complaint concerning the intention of the defendant, with a view of showing express malice, are not issuable. (Fry v. Beanett, 5 Sands. 54; Code Rep. N. S. 238.),Conclusions of lawv.]-A mere conclusion of law, whether stated in the complaints or not, cannot be made the sub- ject of an issue (1PKyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297, 303; Fosdick v. Gross, sp. t., 22 How. 158; Drake v. Coclkroft, 4 E. D. Smith, 34; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377; Brolwn v. Ryc7cnman, sp. t., 12 How. 313), unless it is set up in the complaint as a fact, without any allegations of fact from,* Archer v. Boudinet (Code Rep. N. S. 373), if to the contrary, is erro- neous. t In Wager v. Ide (14 Barb. 468), it was held that an issue might be raised upon a conclusion of law in the complaint. But that point was not necessary to be decided, and such a doctrine cannot be sustained. 150,THE ANSWER.
which it may be deduced, in which case the defendant may treat it as an averment of fact, and as such take issue thereon. (Morrow v. Cougan, sp. t., 3 Abb. 328; Anon., sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 67; see Davis v. olppock, 6 Duer, 256; McKnight v. Hunt, 3 id. 615.) For examples of mere legal conclusions, see ante, p. 10. Mixed allegations of law and fact may be denied, if the fact involved is material. (Lucas v. Noc7ells, 10 Bing. 157; Ralnsford v. Copeland, 6 Ad. & El. 485; see Davis v. Hollpoc7, 6 Duer, 256; McKnight v. Hunt, 3 id. 615.),ART. 5.-Form of denial in general. The answer may contain either a general or a specific denial of the allegations of the complaint (Code, Â§ 149), but it cannot contain both, as after a general denial, specific denials are redundant, and will be struck out. (Dennlison v. Dennison, 9 How. 246.) A denial may, it seems, follow the form of the com- plaint, provided it meets its substance. Thus, where, in an action for conversion, the only allegation of the complaint showing that the property ever came to the defendant's possession was an averment that it was lent to him by the plaintiff, it was held that a denial of this statement raised a material issue. (Elton v. Marh7c7m, 20 Barb. 343.) But it must meet the substance, and not merely the form of the allegation. Thus, where a complaint set out the condition of a deed, and averred that a mortgage accompanying it contained the same condition, an answer, denying that the mortgage contained the words (repeating them) which were set out in the complaint as the condition of the deed, was held bad on demurrer, inasmuch as the mortgage might have embodied such a condition in itself by a mere reference to the deed, without literally containing the same words. (Dinmonr v. Dunm, 15 N. Y. 498; rev'g S. C., 8 How. 16.),151 THE ANSWER.
General denial.]-A general denial is a denial in one clause of every allegation of the complaint. (See Denni. son v. Dennison, 9 How. 246; Kellogg v. Church, sp. t., 4 id. 339.),A general denial may be partial, The answer may expressly admit the truth of some allegations of the complaint, and deny all the rest in one clause. (Blaisdell v. Raymond, 6 Abb. 148; 5 id. 144; Parshall v. Tillo, sp. t., 13 How. 7; see Genesee Mut. Ins. Co. v. Moyniheni, sp. t., 5 How. 421.) And it may deny in one clause all the allegations contained in certain specified paragraphs of the complaint, leaving the rest uncontroverted. (Gassett v. Crocker, sp. t., 9 Abb. 39.),The common form of a general denial is " The defend- ant denies each and every allegation of the complaint." (See Kellogg v. Church, sp. t., 4 How. 339.) It is not unusual to meet with answers which deny "every mate- rial allegation," but this form, though given in Voorhies' Code (Gtl ed.), 202, is unsanctioned by any authority, and is plainly too equivocal to be tolerated. The com- missioners of the Code have, in their book of forms, objected to the use of the word " deny," in any case, and not without justice. Nevertheless, the form above men- tioned has been too long in use to be shaken by anything less than a rule of court, or a positive statute prohibiting it. The form which they recommend is a direct averment "that no allegation in the complaint is true." (Booi of Forms, No. 170.),Specific denial.]-A specific denial is made by denying separate allegations one by one. (Sewtard v. Miller, sp. t., 6 How. 312; Rosenthal v. Brush, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 228.),.Clust be direct.]-An averment "that this defendant says that he denies" is entirely insufficient. (Arthur v. Brooks, 14 Barb. 533; Blake v. Eldred, sp. t., 18 How. 240.) 152,THE ANSWER.
3slsst be disjunLctive.]-A denial of a series of allega- tions must be in the disjunctive-that is, it must contro- vert each of them viewed separateiy, and not merely deny them collectively. (Shearman v. N. Y. Central Mills, 1 Abb. 187*; Young v. Catlett, 6 Duer, 437; King v. Ray, 11 Paige, 235.) Thus, a denial that an act was done at the time and in the manner stated in the complaint (Livingston v. H1am- ier, 7 Bosw. 670; Shearnma v. N. Y. Central .Mills, supra; Davison v. Powell, 16 How. 467; Salilecr v. Lusk, sp. t., 7 id. 430), or that a note w ls made " as i is set out in the complaint" (Shlearinmt v. N Y. Central 1hills, supra), or that a note was presented for payment and payment refused, and protest made, and notice thereof given to the indorser (Young v. Catlett, supra), or that the defendant assaulted and seized and shook the plaintiff (Ho)pkins v. Everett, sp. t., 6 How. 159), is bad. Even an answer denying that the defendant did this act, or that, or another, has been condemned, on the ground that it was uncertain, and that "nor" should have been substituted for " or" (Otis v. Ross, 8 How. 193), but this seems to us hypercritical. Hypothetical denial.]-It has been held that an answer could not be allowed to deny allegations in a hypotheti- cal form-as to allege that if a certain ditch was dug, it was dug without the knowledge of tile defendant. (Wies v. Fanning, sp. t., 9 How. 543.) But this rule is too strict to be maintained under the Code in all cases. The true rule is that when a fact is presumptively within the knowledge of the defendant, he cannot plead hypotheti- cally concerning it (Lewis v. Aclcer, 11 How. 163; see Buddington v. Davis, sp. t., 6 How. 401; Sayles v. Wooden, sp. t., id. 84; Porter v. M'Creedy, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. *Affirming S. C. sub. nom. Thorn v. . YE. Central nills (sp. t., 10 HIow. 19.),20,THE ANSWER.,153
88), and so where he has the means of informing himself at hand, without difficulty (see Hance v. Rumming, 2 E. D) Smith, 48; Code Rep. N. S. 204), but that in other cases he may. (Dovan v. Dilnsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503; Ketc7am v. Zerega, 1 E. D. Smith, 587; Brown v. Rbyck. manz, sp. t., 12 How. 313.) Indeed, it is not easy to see why a hypothetical denial should ever be disturbed. Say. ing that if a certain allegation is true, then another alle. gation is not true, is, for all the purposes of the action, an admission of the former charge, and cannot possibly prejudice the plaintiff, since whatever is not denied is admitted to be true, (Code, Â§ 168.),ART. 6.-Denial of knowuledge or informatioi. The defendant may deny, either generally or specifi- cally, having any knowledge or information concerning the allegations of the complaint, sufficient to form a belief. (Code, Â§ 149.),WlIen not allowved.]-A defendant is not allowed to use this form of denial with reference to acts alleged to have been done by him (Lewis v. Acker, 11 How. 163; Pales v Hicks, sp. t., 12 id. 153; Richardson v. Wilton, 4 Sands. 708; Wesson v. Judd, sp. t., 1 Abb. 254; Edwivards v. Lent, sp. t., 8 How. 28), or to him (Edwards v. Lent, supra) or 1 y or to his agent (Shearnman v. N. Y. Central Mills, 1 Abb. 187; aft'g S. 0., sub. nom. Thorn v. Same, 10 How. 19) or partner (Chalm7ni v. Palmer, sp. t., 12 How. 37), acting as such, unless some excuse is shown for his inability to pro- cure information on the subject (ib.), or to recollect the circumstances. (See Richardson v. Wilton, 4 Sands. 708.) Such excuse need not however be alleged in the pleading itself (Leach v. Boynton, sp. t., 3 Abb. 1), and should pro- bably be reserved until a motion is made to strike out the answer as sham. (Ib.)*,* A contrary opinion was expressed in Richardson v. Wilton (4 Sanfd 708), and Chapman v. Palmer (sp. t., 12 How. 37); but clearly without sufficient consideration. Such matters have no place in a pleading. 154,THE ANSWER.
Denial of information. When not allowed. Form of such denial. Such a denial is not allowed in reference to any In, ters concerning which the defendant is presump- tively informed (Sales v. Hicks, sp. t., 12 How. 153; Lavwrewe v. Derby, sp. t., 15 Abb. 346 n.; see Shearmanr v. N. Y. Central Mills, 1 Abb. 187; Richardson v. Wilton, 4 Sands. 708*), nor concerning which he has the means of information at hand, and must be willfully ignorant. (Hance vv.lummning, 2 E. D. Smith, 48; Code Rep. N. S. 204.) But unless he has the means of information directly at hand, he is at liberty to answer in this form. (Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 Abb. 286; Wesson v. Judd, sp. t., 1 Abb. 2.54.) Form oqf suich denial.]-A denial of this character must bein the precise language of the Code. A mere denial of knowledge sufficient to form a belief (Ketch7am v. Zerega, 1 E. D. Smith, 553; Edwards v. Lent, sp. t., 8 How. 28), or of ilformation only (see People v. M'Cumber, sp. t., 15 IIow. 186; 27 Barb. 632), or an averment that the defendant "does not know, of his information or other- wise," that a certain allegation is true (Sayre v. C ishing, sp. t., 7 Abb. 371), or that he " is not informed, and can- not state" whether it is true not (Elton v. Martham, 20 Barb. 343), or that he "has no recollection" concern- ingit (Nichols v. Jones, sp. t., 6 How. 355), or that he "is ignorant of whether," &c. (Wood v. Staniels, 3 Code Rep. 152), is bad. It is not necessary to add to a denial of knowledge or information, &c., any further denial of the allegation, such as " that the defendant therefore denies the same " (Flood v. Reynolds, sp. t., 13 How. 112), and such an averment will not cure a defective denial of knowledge, &c. (See Chalpman v. Palmer, sp. t., 12 How. 37; Edwards v. ent, sp. t., 8 id. 28.) * See to the contrary, however, Cswwell v. Bushnell (14 Barb. 393); S. 0. Qb. nom. Sherman v. Btshnell (7 How. 171.),155
Remedy against error.]-A denial of knowledge, &c., when correct in form, but made under circumstances which render it inadmissible for the defendant so to plead, may be stricken out as sham (Hance v. RumMing, 2 E. D. Smith, 48; Code Rep. N. S. 204; Lawrence v. Derby, sp. t., 15 Abb. 346 n.; see Leach v. Boynton, sp. t., 3 Abb. 1; Richardson v. Wilton, 4 Sands. 708), but cannot be regarded as frivolous. (Leach v. Boynton, sp. t., 3 Abb, 1.*),On the other hand, if such a denial is defective in form, it may be fiivolous (Sayre v. Ctishing, sp. t., 7 Abb. 371; Nichols v. Jones, sp. t., 6 How. 355), but is not for that reason sham.,ART. 7.- Allegations of nlew tmatter. What is new lmaltter.]--New matter is a statement of facts which are not necessarily inconsistent with the material allegations of the complaint, construed according to their natural and obvious meaning (not according to their legal effect), and which show that, even if the truth of the com- plaint is admitted, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover all that lie demands, or that the defendant is entitled to recover something against him. There are some dicta at varinnce with the principles which we have here stated (see Rtadde v. Riuckgaber, 3 Duer, 684; Bellinger v. Craigue, 31 Barb. 534, and other cases), but it will be found impos- sible to reconcile the spirit of the Code, or the decisions of the court of last resort, with any narrower rule.,Not only are all statements which admit that the plain- tiff kad a cause of action, and set up facts in discharge or avoidance of it, to be regarded as " new matter," but also all defenses which are not included, according to the natural meaning of the words used, in a mere denial. Thus, not only are such defenses as payment (M'Kyring * This is the correct view, notwithstanding Shearman v. N. Y. Central MHils (1 Abb. 187), FaTes v. Iicks (sp. t., 12 How. 153), Chapman v.

v. But, 16 N. Y. 297; Texier v. Gotinl, 5 Duer, 389), award (Brazill v. Isham, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 9), accord and satisfaction (see Texier v. Gouin, supra), or release (see ib.), new matter, but also all defenses invalidating a con- tract, such as fraud (N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National protection Ins. Co., 20 Barb. 468*), mistake (Seeley v. Elgell, 17 Barb. 530t), duress (see Texier v. Gonlin, 5 Duer, 389; Baker v. Bailey, 16 Barb. 54), or incapacity to con- tract. (See Dillaye v. Park]s, 31 Barb. 132; Castree v. Gavelle, 4 E. D. Smith, 425.) So of course is the defense of usury. (Gould v. Segee, 5 Duer, 260.) And even a plea of unexpired credit would seem to be new matter, for though the contrary has been held (Gilbert v. Cram, sp. t., 12 Hfow. 455), it is now settled that a complaint need not show that the debt is due (Smith v. Hoblmes, 19 N. Y. 271; Maynlartd v. Talcott, 11 Barb. 569), and that the fact that it is not due must be set up by answer (ib.), and we can conceive of nothing to which such rules apply, which can be considered anything else than new matter. What is not.]-Nothing is new matter, which the de- fendant is not bound to prove affirmatively. Thus it is necessary for a defendant expressly to deny that the plaintiff is incorporated, in order to put it upon proof of the fact (3 It. S. (5th ed.) 755; [2 id. 458]); yet if such denial is made, the plaintiff must prove the fact, although it need not be alleged in the complaint (see ante, p. 86); and such denial is therefore not new matter. So in an action against a corporation, though the complaint does not allege the incorporation of the defendlat, yet as upon a denial thereof, the plaintiff must prove it, such denial is not new matter. (Stoddard v. Onondagar Con- ference, 12 Barb. 573.) A denial of any fact which the plaintiff must prove in * Reversed on other grounds, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 85. t Reversed on other grounds, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 542.,157 THE ANSWER.
order to recover is not new matter (Stoddard v. Onoldag Conference, 12 Barb. 573), even though not expressly averred in the complaint. (Ib.) For this reason a defense founded on the statute of frauds is not new matter; and under a general denial, the defendant can avail himself of the fact that the contract sued upon is void for want of being in writing (Amburger v. Marvin, 4 E. D. Smith, 393), though it is more honest pleading to allege that no such contract was ever made in writing, which is a suffi. cient defense, without setting forth the defendant's inten- tion to rely thereon, as was formerly required in equty. (Haight v. Child, 34 Barb. 186.),New matter must be pleadld.]-New matter must in all cases be specially pleaded, as no affirmative defense can be proved at the trial unless set up in the answer. (M'Kyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297; Byxbie v. Wood, 24 id. 607; Brazill v. Isham, 12 id. [2 Kern.] 9; aff'g S. 0., 1 E. D. Smith, 437; Buckn/am v.

Finch, 29 id. 170.),Defense, how pleaded.]-It is sufficient to state aprima facie defense. It is not necessary to negative every pos- sible supposition unfavorable to the defendant. (Bartlett v. Benson, 14 Mees. & W. 733.),A contrary rule has been laid down in regard to the defense of usury (Banks v. Van Antwerp, sp. t., 5 Abb. 411; 15 How. 2a), but erroneously; for that defense is to be governed by precisely the same rules as any other. (Dagal v. Simmons, 23 N. Y. 491; Catlin v. Gunt+r, 11 id. [1 Kern.] 368.),Counterclaim, how pleade.]-A counterelaim is gov- erned, so far as the stating part of it is concerned, by pre- cisely the same rules as a complaint. (Merritt v. Millard, 158,THE ANSWER.
5 Bosw. 645.) It must of course be separately stated and numbered as a distinct plea. (Ante, p. 5.) It is advisable to stabt expressly that the counterclaim is set up as such, for if the facts stated would constitute either a mere defense or a counterclaim, it will be presumed, in the absence of any averment to the contrary, that they are set up as a defense merely. (Bates v. Rosekrans, 23 How. 98; Burrall v. De Groot, 5 Duer, 379.) The answer must show on its face whether the demand set up as a counterclaim belonged to the defendant at the commencement of the action or not. (Van Yalen v. Laapham, 5 Duer, 689; and see ante, p. 137.) If the counter- claim is one which can only be pleaded as such by virtue of its connection with the transaction upon which the action is founded, the facts which so connect it must be stated. (Brown v. Buckingham, sp. t., 11 Abb. 387; 21 How. 190.) A mere allegation that the claim so set up "arose out of" such transaction, amounts to nothing whatever. (lb.),THE ANSWER.,159

Betts, sp. t., 23 How. 396; see Wait v. Ferguson, sp. t., 14 Abb. 379.) The principles stated in articles 1, 7, and 10 of chapter 48 (antepp. 122, 127, 133), are in general equally applica- ble to demurrers to answers as to demurrers to complaints. Thus, no demurrer will lie for mere vagueness or uncer- tainty* (Dagal v. Simnwns, 23 N. Y. 491), nor for the in- sertion of redundant and irrelevant matter. (Ketchamn v. ZCvya, 1 E. D. Smith, 553; Watson v. Husson, 1 Duer, 242; Smiith v. Greenin, 2 Sands. 702.) When an answer is amended at the trial, the plaintiff cannot demur to it. The question of the sufficiency of the pleading, as amended, is to be decided on the motion for leave to amend. (Therassoe v. Peterson, 22 How. 98.),ART. 3.-Form of demurrer. Formerly, a demurrer to an answer was required to state the grounds of objection, but since the amendment of 1857, this is not required. And a demurrer may be sustained upon grounds not suggested even upon the argument. (Xenia Bank v. Lee, 2 Bosw. 694; 7 Abb. 372.) It is nevertheless expedient to state the objection in the words of section 153, " that the facts stated in the answer do not constitute a defense or counterclaim," which was 'held a sufficient statement even under the former rule. (Arthur v. Brooks, 14 Barb. 533; Anibal v. Hunter, sp. t., 6 How. 255; Hyde v. Conrad, sp. t., 5 id. 112.) * In Fiy v. Bennett (5 Sands 54; Code Rep. N. S. 238), it was held that an answer was, under the Code as it then stood, demurrable for any non-com- pliance with the rules of pleading. Subsequent amendments have removed the ground of this decision, the correctness of which, even at the time, was more than doubtful. (Compare Van TVyck v. Guafrie, 4 Duer, 268.),21,161

On the argument of a demurrer to an answer, the de- fendant may attack the complaint, and if it appears that the complaint states no cause of action, or one of which the court has no jurisdiction, judgment must be rendered for the defendant, notwithstanding any defects in his answer. (Sc7chwab v. Furniss, 4 Sands. 704; Code Rep. N. S. 342; Ayres v. Covill, 18 Barb. 260; see Fry v. Bennett, 5 Sands. 54; Code Rep. N. S. 238; Stoddard v. Ootulaga Coonference, 12 Barb. 573; Noxon v. Bentley, sp. t., 7 How. 316.) No other objection to the complaint can, however, be raised on such argument. (People v. Banker, sp. t., 8 How. 258.) And it has been doubted whether the rule is at all applicable to a demurrer to a counterclaim. (See Graham v. Dunnigan, 6 Duer, 629; 4 Abb. 426.),If one of several defenses is demurred to, the plaintiff cannot sustain the complaint, in case that is attacked, by. referring to admissions in another defense. (Ayres v. Covill, 18 Barb. 260.) 162

When the answer sets up a counterclaim, the plaintiff may reply to such counterclaim, by a general or specific denial of all or part of its allegations, or by setting up new matter, not inconsistent with the complaint, consti- tuting a defense thereto. (Code, Â§ 153.) The court may, in its discretion, on motion of the defendant, require a reply to be made to new matter in an answer, constituting a defense by way of avoidance. (Code. 153.t) When thus ordered, a reply in such case is governed by the same rules as a reply to a counter- claim. (Tb.) The plaintiff is net at liberty to reply to any matter not constituting a counterclaim, without an order of the court. (Devlin v. Bevins, sp. t., 22 How. 290.) And a reply to such matter, without such authority, will be stricken out on motion. (Ib.) As to what constitutes a counterclaim, see ante, 2. 136 and as to new matter in defense, see ante, p. 156. In an action commenced in a justice's court, and trans- ferred to a court of record on a plea of title, the plaintiff may reply in like manner as in other actions. (Jewvett v.

L --- ~~~~~~~~~~~~,TITLE V. CHAPTER LIV.,THE ISSUE. ABTICLE 1. Issue, what.,2. What is, or is not, at issue. ART. 1.-Issue, what. The object of plecding is to present, for the deter- mination of the tribunal charged with the trial of the cause, the precise question or questions in controversy between the parties. These questions, when ascertained, are called the issues.,Issues arise upon the pleadings, when a fact or conclu- sion of law is maintained by one party and controverted by the other. (Code, Â§ 248.),They are of two kinds, viz., of law, and of fact. (Ib.) An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to any pleading (Code, $ 249); an issue of fact, upon a material allegation of a pleading, controverted, or deemed to be controverted, as hereafter stated.*,There may be now, as formerly, several issues in one action, both of law and of fact. Thus, in an action against the maker and indorser of a note, it might be that the former would plead want of consideration as a defense, and the latter want of notice of dishonor. Or in an action upon two claims, the defendant might demur to one, and defend against the other upon matters of fact.,When an issue is raised between the parties, so as to be ready for trial, issue is said to be "joined." No formal,* The definition in the Code (section 250), is too restricted, having been enacted in 1849, and not conformed to subsequent changes in the rest of the Code. 166,THE ISSUE.
proceedings are necessary under the Code, as they were under the former practice, in order to complete an issue. Issue is joined by operation of law.,AIRT. 2.-What is, or is not, at issue. Wlutt is at issue.]-Every material allegation denied by an adverse pleading is of course at issue. Allegations of new matter in the answer, not relating to a counterclaim, and of new matter of any kind in the reply, are to be deemed controverted by the adverse party, without further pleading, as upon a direct denial or avoidance. (Code, Â§ 168.) And any matter may be proved at the trial, without being pleaded, which avoids such new matter. (Garner v. Manhattan Building Asso., 6 Duer, 539.) Allegations not actually made, though necessary to be proved, are not admitted by not denying them (see Bank of Havana v. Magee, 20 N. Y. 358; Stoddard v. Onondaga Conference, 12 Barb. 577), and if the adverse party chooses to go to trial, considering such allegations as made, he has a right to controvert them at the trial.,What is not at issue.]-Every material allegation in a complaint or a counterclaim, not controverted by the adverse pleading in the manner prescribed by the Code, is to be taken as true for the purposes of the action (Code, Â§ 168), and of course is not at issue. The pleader need not therefore give any evidence of the truth of such allega- tions (Bacon v. Cropsey, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 195; Dart v. Farmers' Bank, 27 Barb. 337; Fagen v. Davison, 2 Duer, 153), and the adverse party is not at liberty to disprove them, either directly or indirectly. (Bobbins v. Richardson, 2 Bosw. 248; Bobbins v. Codman, 4 E. D. Smith, 315.) In order to raise an issue, the complaint must be con- troverted in the manner prescribed by the Code; and therefore the mere statement of facts apparently incon- eiatent with the allegations of the complaint, does not,167 THE ISSUE.
raise an issue. (Wood v. Whiting, 21 Barb. 190.) Thus, if the complaint alleges that a debt was due to A, and the answer alleges that it was due to A and B, as partners, this does not of itself amount to a denial of the former averment. (Ib.),Where there are several defenses or replies, in one of which an allegation is denied, and in another it is not, such allegation is at issue for the purposes of the f, mer defense or reply, though it is not as to the latter. (Swift v. Kingsley, 24 Barb. 541; Ayres v. Covill, 18 id. 260; Troy & Rutland R. R. Co. v. Kerr, 17 id. 581.) And of course, where several defendants plead separately, an admission in the answer of one of them has no effect upon the rights of the others. (See Woodworth v. Bellows, sp. t., 4 How. 24.),It is only material allegations, the truth of which is admitted by not denying them. (Oechs v. Cool, 3 Duer, 161; Conioss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 314; Isam v. Wil- lianmson, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 340.),What is a material allegation..]-Those allegations only are material, which the pleader is bound to prove upon the trial, in order to maintain his case. (Oechs v. Cook, 3 Duer, 161; Connoss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 314; Fry v. Bennett, 5 Sands. 54; Code Rep. N. S. 238.) Matter in aggravation of damages (Fny v. Bennett, supra), or show- ing special damage, when that is not the substance of the action; allegations merely descriptive, and inserted only for the purpose of enabling the adverse party to identify the transaction (Connoss v. Meir, supra); allegations which the pleader would not be allowed to prove on the trial (Barton v. Sackett, sp. t., 3 How. 358); and of course all allegations of legal conclusions, or other matters which are irrelevant, and might be struck out on motion, ar not admitted by not denying them.,A fact, not otherwise material, may be made material by the form of the pleadings (Irivinqston v. Miller, 8 N. Y. 168,THE ISSUE.

SUPPLEMENTAL ANID CROSS PLEADINGS.,CUAPTER LV. Supplemental pleadings.,LVI. Cross pleadings.,CHAPTER LV. SUPPLLMENTAL PLEADINGS. ARTICLE 1. When and how allowed.,2. Course of proceeding on supplemental p!eadings. ART. 1.-When and how alowed. Either party may be allowed, on motion, to make a slpplemental complaint, answer, or reply, alleging facts Laterial to the case, occurring after hi. former pleading was made, or of which he was then ignorant. (Code, 177.) And after a year has elapsed from the death of a party to the action, it may be continued, by leave of the court, on a supplemental complaint by or against the representatives of the deceased. (Code, Â§ 121.) A supplemental pleading can be made only by order of the court (see Palmer v. Murray, sp. t., 18 How. 545; Lampson v. McQueen, sp. t., 15 id. 345; Lawrence v. Bo- ton, 3 Paige, 294), but such order is granted almost as a matter of course, upon a case being made within the terms of the Code (Palnwer v. Murray, supra; see Eager v. Price, 2 Paige, 333); unless it appears to be sought only for vexatious purposes. (Ib.) Thus if it is shown that another action is pending for the same cause as is proposed to be set up in a supple-,22,169
When and how allowed. What should be thus pleaded. mental complaint (Saye v. Mosher, sp. t., 17 How. 367); or, if a proposed supplemental answer is clearly shown to be false (Morell v. Garelly, 16 Abb. 269), the motion' will be denied.,The proposed pleading must usually be exhibited on the application, and if it is manifestly insufficient, the motion will be denied (Bowen v. Irish Congregation, 6 Bosw. 245; .PlCulloug7 v. Colby, 4 id. 603); but if its sufficiency is a matter of doubt, it should be ::llowed to be pleaded, leaving the adverse party to his demurrer. (Hoyt v. Sheldon, 4 Abb. 59; Palmer v. Murray, sp. t., 18 How. 545; see Harrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 161.),A supplemental pleading should not be allowed for the purpose of setting up facts which can properly be em- bodied in the original pleading by amendment (1PMahot v. Allen, 3 Abb. 89; 1 Hilt. 103; aff'g S. C., 12 How. 39; but see Hoyt v. Sheldon, 4 Abb. 59); and it cannot be allowed for the purpose of setting up facts existing when' the original pleading was served, and then known to the pleader (M'Mahol v. Allen, supra; Houghton v. Skinner, sp. t., 5 How. 420; Norton v. Abbott, sp. t., Feb. 1864); though a doubt as to the pleader's knowledge should be decided in his favor. (Harrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 161.),When, after the service of an answer setting up the pendency of another action, judgment is rendered there- in, such judgment should be pleaded by supplemental answer. (See Hendricks v. Decker, 35 Barb. 298.),In a creditor's action, the fact that the debtor has acquired property since the commencement of the action may be set up by a supplemental complaint. (Eager v. Price, 2 Paige, 333.) And such is the only proper method of setting up in a complaint facts occurring during the pendency of the action. (Hornfager v. Hornfager, sp. t., 6 How. 13; Hastings v. MPKinley, 1 E. D. Smith, 278; Hope v. Brincekerhoff, 4 Edw. Oh. 660.),Where the facts proposed to be pleaded constitute an 170

Curtiss, sp. t., 8 How. 56.) Motion how mnade.]-The motion must be made on notice (Garner v. Hannah, 6 Duer, 262), and ought to be made before the trial of the cause. (Ib.) It cannot be granted at the trial, without previous notice. (lb.) Ters.]--On allowing a supplemental answer to be pleaded, the defendant may be required to waive some or all of his other defences (Bate v. Fellowes, 4 Bosw. 638), and such terms should be imposed where the sufficiency and equity of the proposed defence are doubtful. (Ib.) On allowing a settlement effected in disregard of an attorney's lien to be pleaded, the payment to such attor- ney of all costs will be required. (Wood v. Northwest fresb. Church, sp. t., 7 Abb. 210 a.; see Owen v. Mason, sp. t. 18 How. 156.) ART. 2.-Course of proceeding on supplemental pleadings. A supplemental pleading must contain matter addi- tional, and not contradictory, to the original (see Slauson v. Englelart, 34 Barb. 198), particularly when the order giving leave to serve it directs that it be without preju- dice to the proceedings already had. (Sorbes v. Waller, 25 N. Y. 430; affirming S. C., 4 Bosw. 475.) It need not (Johnson v. Snyder, sp. t., 7 How. 395; see Slauson v. Englehart, 34 Barb. 198), and doubtless should not, repeat the allegations of the original pleading, but if it does, the error cannot of course be reached by demurrer. (Johnson v. Snyder, supra.) It does not supersede the original pleading, but leaves all the issues thereby raised, unaffected. (Slauson v. Englicart, 34 Barb. 198.) A supplemental pleading may be demurred to, in the tame cases as an original pleading. (Goddard v. Benson,,171
15 Abb. 191.) It is governed, in short, by all the rules applicable to an original pleading of the same character.,The adverse party has a right to plead to a supple. mental pleading, but not to plead anew to the original pleading. (Dann v. Baker, 12 How. 521.),CHAPTER LVI. CROSS PLEADINGS. In equity.]-Under the former practice in equity, a defendant might file a cross-bill for the purpose of ob- taining affirmative relief (2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 126), which was considerd as in substance a defense to the original bill, and was included for all purposes in the original action. (Id. 127.) It was accordingly governed by special rules, which may be found in treatises on equity, pleadings and practice. (See id. 126-136.),Under the Code.]-Notwithstanding the apparent opin- ion of an able and learned writer to the contrary (Yan Santv. Eq. Pr. 224), which, however, he has not fortified with either argument or authority, we have little doubt that a cross complaint, in the peculiar sense of the word as used in equity, is not a legitimate proceeding under the Code.,Our reasons for this opinion are easily stated. The Code (section 140) has abolished all previous forms, and repudiated all previous rules of pleading. (See ante, p. 2.) Old rules of practice are saved, where consistent with the Code (section 469), but no rules of pleading, unless possibly those which are purely statutory. (Code, Â§ 471.) No pleading is therefore now allowable, unless positively authorized by the Code (ante, p. 2), and it is certain that the Code nowhere authorizes or recognizes any such pleading as a cross complaint. 172,CROSS PLEADINGS.
Actions in nature of a cross-action. How conducted. Action in nature of a cross-action.]-Nevertheless, the defendant has a right to bring an action for such relief as he may be entitled to, and there is no harm in calling it a cross-action, or the complaint therein a cross-complaint, so long as it is clearly understood that it is really an inde- pendent action, controlled by none of the rules peculiar to cross-actions in equity. The counterclaim authorized by the Code covers most of the ground formerly occupied by a cross-bill, the only exception being in a case where parties are necessary to the determination of the defendant's claim, who are not included, and not necessary, in the original action. Where such is the case, an action in the nature of a cross-action is probably the most apnropriate remedy. Such an action may also be necessary in some cases in which affirmative relief is sought against a co-defendant. (See post, chap. cviii.) How conducted.]-A cross-acti , under the Code, is, and is therefore to be conducted as an independent action in all respects. The pleadings need not refer to the original action, and differ in no way from pleadings in other actions. The plaintiff in such an action may, however, apply on Notice, for an order directing it to be placed on the calendar and tried in conjunction with the original action, and that judgment be entered in both actions simultaneously. Such an order will undoubtedly be granted on its being shown that the rights of the applicant would be preju- diced by a judgment being rendered in the original action before the decision of the cross action.,173 CROSSB PL'EADINGS.

Titat are.]-The Code being now the sole authority for pleading, no pleading can be allowed which is not authorized by its provisions. Thus a rejoinder to a reply would manifestly be unauthorized, and indeed has never, so far as we are aware, been attempted. But even a pleading recognized by the Code, if used in a case not provided for by it, is equally unauthorized. Thus a demurrer to a mere denial in an answer is a nullity (see Richtmyer v. HIaskins, 9How. 481; and ante, p. 160); and so is a reply to any matter not constituting a counter- claim. (Putnlan v. De Forest, sp. t., 8 How. 146.),Remedy.]-The only remedy against an unauthorized pleading, appears to be by motion to strike it out, or to set it aside. (See Perkins v. Farniham, 10 How. 120; Reilay v Parker, sp. t., 11 id. 266; Gilbert v. Crane, sp. t., 12 id. 455; Putnam v. De Forest, sp. t., 8 id. 146.) No judg- ment can be rendered upon it, even overruling it. (Richt- myer v. Haskins, 9 How. 481.) Possibly it might be returned and disregarded. (See Serrand v. Herbeson, 3 Duer, 655.) 174
Unauthorized pleadings. Irrelevancy. What is irrelevant. When a pleading is partly unauthorized, a motion to strike out such part as irrelevant, is clearly proper. (See )tirant v. Gardner, sp. t., 10 Abb. 445; 19 How. 94.),CHAPTER LVIII. IRRELEVANT AND REDUNDANT PLEADINGS.,ARTICLE 1. Irrelevancy.,2. Redundancy. 3. Remedy against such errors. ART. 1.-Irrelevancy. Wi7at is irrelevant.]-Everything is irrelevant in plead- ing which neither aids in constituting a cause of action in a complaint (JLee v. F7ia.9, 3 Sands. 736; Code Rep. N. S. 116; Sellar v. Sage, sp. t., 12 How. 531; 13 id. 230; boffatt v. Pratt sp. t., 12 id. 48), nor a defense or counter- claim in an answver (Gassett v. Crocker, sp. t., 10 Abb. 133; Kurtz v. McGuire, 5 Dner, 660; Edgerton v. Smith, 3 id. 614; Russ v. Brooks, 4 E, D. Smith, 644; Gould v. Wil- liams, sp. t., 9 How. 51; Stewart v. Bouton, sp. t., 6 id. 71; Rensselaer & Wash. P. R. Co. v. Wetsel, sp. t., id. 68; McGowaat v. Morrow, 3 Code Rep. 9), unless it has some legitimate bearing upon the judgment to be rendered. (Martin v. Kaiwouse, 2 Abb. 330; Howard v. Tiffany, 3 Sands 695; Code Rep. N. S. 99; Molony v. Dows, sp. t., 15 How. 261; Root v. Foster, sp. t., 9 id. 37.) The fact that such matter affects the right of the plaintiff to a provisional remedy will not make it relevant, for the pleadings have nothing to do with such remedies. (Lee v. Elias, 3 Sands. 736; Code Rep. N. S. 116; Putnam v. Puhtnam, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 64.) Allegations which tend in the least degree to establish a valid claim or defense cannot be considered as irrele- vant even though grossly defective in point of form (Dovan v. Dinsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503; Struver v.
- --- Irrelevancy. What is irrelevant,,-L ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-- Ocean Ins. Co., 2 Hilt. 475; 9 Abb. 23; Alfred v. Watkins, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 343; 9nSmith v. Shufelt, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 175); as for example a negative pregnant (Dovan v. Dinsmore, supra), or a statement of facts which, with the addition of one or two other allegations, might constitute a valid claim or defense. (Struver v. Ocean Ins. Co.; Alfred v. Watkins, supra.),Allegations which the pleader would not be allowed to prove at the trial, and incapable of being amended so as to be admissible are clearly irrelevant (Van Benschoten v. Yaple, sp. t., 13 How. 97; Brown v. Orvis, sp. t., 6 How. 475), and allegations which he would be allowed to prove are not irrelevant (see Follett v. Jewett, sp. t., 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 193), though they may be redundant.,Nothing will be regarded as irrelevant which, in any possible aspect of the case, may become material. (Averill v. Taylor, sp. t., 5 How. 476.),Arguments (Gould v. Williams, sp. t., 9 How. 51), and inferences of law (ib.; Stewart v. Bouton, sp. t., 6 How. 71), are plainly irrelevant.,Where two or more inconsistent claims are united in one complaint, the defendant may have all but one stricken out as irrelevant matter. (Waller v. Raskan, sp. t., 12 How. 28.),It was held, down to 1851, that irrelevancy could never be imputed to an entire pleading, that the pleading must be partly good, or there could be nothing irrelevant in it, and this was held as well of an answer (Fabbricotti v. Lat- nitz, 3 Sands. 743; Code Rep. N. S. 121; Earlow v. HaEt- ilton, sp. t., 6 How. 475; Nichols v. Jones, sp. t., id. 355), as of a complaint. (Benedict v. Dake, sp. t., 6 How. 352.) As far as the complaint is concerned, there is no objection to this view, for until a cause of action is stated there is nothing to which an entire pleading could be irrelevant; but an entire answer may be irrelevant to the action, and in 1851 (after the cases cited were decided), Â§ 152 of the Code was amended so as expressly to authorize "irrelevant answers,"
Irrelevancy. Redundancy. Remedy against such errors. as well as " defenses," to be stricken out (see Lee Bank v. Kitclibg, 11 Abb. 435, 438; Reed v. Latson, 15 Barb. 9); and entire answers (Fleury v. Roget, 5 Sands. 646), as well as entire defenses (Bailey v. Lane, 13 Abb. 354; Lee Bank v. Kitcing, 11 id. 435; Slack v. Cotton, 2 E. D. Smith, 398; Kurts v. McGuire, 5 Duer, 660; Reed v. Latson, 15 Barb. 9; Van Benschoten v. Yaple, sp. t., 13 How. 97), have, under this provision, been stricken out as irrelevant.,ART. 2.-Redundancy. Redundancy is a fault not synonymous with irrelevancy. Irrelevant matter is necessarily redundant, but redundant matter is by no means necessarily irrelevant. (Bowman v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 657.) A needless repetition of material averments; for examplle, would be redundant, but not irrel- evant. (Ib.) . Strictly speaking, every Word beyond what is essen- tial to a lucid statement of the claim or defense is re- dundant (see Butler v. Mason, sp. t., 5 Abb. 40; 16 How. 546), but the courts will take no notice of trifling superfluities of language (see Clark v. Harwood, sp. t., 8 How. 470; Williams v. Hayes, sp. t., 5 id. 470); compare, however, (Warner v. Nelligar, sp. t.,' 12 id. 402), and favor afiull statement of the case, even though a few superfluous words should be used. (Deyo v. Bruldage, sp. t., 13 How. 221; see Denithorne v. Denithorne, sp. t., 15 id. 232.) Mere evidence of the main facts is always considered redundant, and objectionably so. (Rost v. Harris, sp. t., 12 Abb. 446; Radde v. Ruckgaber, 3 Duer, 684; Woodlen v. Strew, sp. t., 10 How. 48; Williams v. Hayes, sp. t., 5 id. 470; Knowles v. Gee, sp. t., 4 id. 317; SLazw v. Jayne, iL 119; see Warner v. Nelligar, sp. t., 12 id. 402.) And a repetition of a single claim or defense is obviously re- dandant. (See ante, p. 25.),ART. 3.-Renedy against suel errors. Remedy by motion.]-Irrelevant or redundant matter may be stricken out of pleadings on motion of any party,23
Remedy against. Motion. Affidavit. aggrieved thereby. (Code, Â§ 160.) And irrelevant answers or defenses may be stricken out. (Code, Â§ 152.),The remedy is therefore by motion to strike out the objectionable matter, and relief cannot be had in any other way against redundancy, nor against partial irrele- vancy in a pleading. Such defects cannot be reached b'r demurrer. (Ante, pp. 25, 123.),When motion must be )mace.]-A motion to strike out part of a pleading must be noticed before demurring to or answering the pleading objected to, and within twenty days after service thereof (Rule 50, Supreme Court.) Nor can it be made after obtaining an extension of time to plead to such pleading (Bowman v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 657. Isiam v. Williamson, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 340); unless the right to "make such motion as may be advised" is reversed in the order or stipulation (Lackey v. Tanderbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 155); nor after notice of trial has been given by the party aggrieved (.Esmond v. Van Benschoten, sp. t., 5 How. 44). And by answering or replying (Goch v. Marsh, sp. t., 8 How. 439,) or demurring to the plead- ing, after notice of this motion, it is waived. (Holnes v. Clark, sp. t., per PECKtHAM, J.,None of these rules, however, apply to a motion to strike out an entire answer as irrelevant. (Miller v. Yose, 4 Sands. 660.),Affdavit, when necessary.]-No affidavit is necessary on this motion (Ford v. Mattice, sp. t., 14 How. 91), except in the case of a repetition of the same cause of action, where it is not apparent on the face of the complaint that there is really but a single transaction in question. (See Lack7ey v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 10 How. 155.),It need not be shown affirmatively that the motion is made within the time prescribed by the rules of court. (Barber v. Bennett, 4 Sands. 705; see Roosa v. Saugerties, &c., Road Co., sp. t., 8 How. 237.*) That is an objection to be raised by the adverse party. (Ib.),* Disapproving Rogers v. Rathbun (sp. t., 6 How. 66).
Remedy against. Notice of motion. When motion will be granted. Notice of notion.]-The notice of motion must specify the ground upon which the motion is made (Bowman v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 657), and the precise portions of the pleading which are objected to (Blake v. Eldred, sp. t., 18 How. 240; Benedict v. Dakle, sp. t., 6 id. 352; 2 Sim. & Stu. 236), as the court will not examine at large to detect errors of this nature. (lb.) . All objections which are intended to be raisS:at any time on these grounds, must be included in one motion, bat objections to separate parts of the pleading should be stated separately, and care should be taken not to include too much or too little in a single objection, for reasons stated hereafter (post ).,Â§ 200. Notice of motion to strike out irrelevant or redundant,tta tter. [As in Â§ 38, ante, i. 412, demanding] that the matter contained [in the second and third paragraphs] of the [answer] be stricken out as [irrelevant]. When tew motion wuill or ivill not be granted.]-The courts will not interfere in every case in which superfluous mat- ter is inserted in a pleading. It must appear that the moving party is "aggrieved" by the error of his opponent (Martin v. Kanouse, 2 Abb. 330; Molony v. Dows, sp. t., 15 How. 261; Denithorne v. Denithorne, sp. t., id. 232; see Brocieinman v. Brandt, sp. t., 10 Abb. 141; Bedell v. Stick- is, 4 How. 432); though as to the meaning of this phrase the decisions are not uniform. On the one hand, it has been said that a party is aggrieved by being required to examine useless matter, and by the risk of either leaving o0me allegation unanswered, and having to meet at the til a claim that it is admitted, or, if he answers it, of aising immaterial issues. (Isaac v. Vellontan, sp. t., 3 Abb.,179
Remedy against. When motion will be granted. When not 464; Williams v. Hayes, sp. t., 5 How. 470.*) On the other hand, it has been sayi that the motion should not be granted unless the superfluity is excessive. (St. John v. Griffith, sp. t., 1 Abb. 39; see Molony v. Dows, sp.,t, 15 How. 261; Martin v. Kanouse, 2 Abb. 330; edell v. Stickles, 4 How. 432.) The true rule we conceive to be, that every useless allegation of which it could be pretend. ed, with any show of reason, however slight, that it was admitted by not being expressly denied, ought to be stricken out of a complaint or a counterclaim; and that in other cases only such allegations should be stricken out as are palpably burdensome to the record, and cale. lated to embarrass the trial, or to afford unfair opportuni- ties of changing the ground of defense.,If there is any doubt as to the pertinency or necessity of the matter objected to, it is usually allowed to stand. (Littlejo7h v. Greeley, sp. t., 13 Abb. 311; 22 How. 345; Anon., 2 Sands. 682; see Bedell v. Stickles, 4 How. 432.),A denial of an immaterial allegation should not be stricken out as irrelevant, if the averment which it denies is pleaded in such form as to invite an issue thereon (Kinlg v. Utica Ins. Co., sp. t., 6 How. 485; see Dovan v. Dins- inore, 33 Barb., 36; 20 How. 503), unless the moving party will consent to strike out the controverted allegation from his own pleading. (See Cutts v. Surridge, 9 Q. B.1015; Tallis v. Tallis, 11 E. L. & E. 457; 18 id. 154.),The analogy between this motion and exceptions in chancery for impertinence has been repeatedly recognized, and the rules of equity concerning such exceptions, have been declared fully applicable to this proceeding (Little- john v. Greeley, sp. t., 13 Abb. 311; 22 How. 345; eiensst laer & Wash. P. R. Co. v. Wetsel, sp. t., 6 id. 68; Carpen- ter v. West, sp. t., 5 id. 53), with the difference that matter of mere evidence, which was allowed to be pleaded in chancery, is now to be stricken out as redundant. (lenss. & Wash. P. B. Co. v. Wetsel, supra.),* Qualifying Hynds v. Griswold (sp. t., 4 How. 69), WVite v. A7dd (sp. t, id. 68), decided by the same justice.
Remedy against. When motion granted. Proceedings under order. Unless the entire clause objected to is improper, the whole will be allowed to stand (Blake v. l7dred, sp. t., 18 How. 240; McIntyre v. Trustees of Union College, 6 Paige, 247; Yan Rensselaer v. Brice, 4 id. 174; Balcorn v. N. Y. Life Ins. & Trust Co., 11 id. 454; Curtis v. Masten, id. 15); and if, upon striking out all that is specified as objectionable, the pleading would be left a mere unintelli- gible fragment, the motion will be denied (Lane v. Gilbert, sp. t., 9 How. 150; see Slack v. Cotton, 2 E. D. Smith, 398); and so if any portion of the pleading would be made senseless. (German v. Machin, 6 Paige, 292; Mcintyre v. Trustees of Union College, id. 247; Franklin v. Keeler, 4 id. 382.) When, however, a mass of irrelevant matter is inex- tricably mixed with a little that is relevant, the whole may be stricken out. (Norton v. Woods, 5 Paige, 260; Powlell v. Kane, id. 255, 268.) And where two claims or defenses are improperly united, one of them may be stricken out, notwithstanding that the other is demurra- ble. (Waller v. Baskan, sp. t., 12 How. 28.) The order.]-The order may be in the following form:,201. Order striking o it irrelevant or redundant matter. [As in Â§ 42, ante, i. 422, directing] that the matter contained in the .......... paragraphs of the .......... be stricken out as [redundant]. Proceedings under the order.]-Unless specially required to do so by the order, the party whose pleading is thus corrected is not bound to serve a new and corrected pleading. Each party can expunge, in his own copy, the words stricken out. (See Ross v. Dinsmore, sp. t., 12 Abb. 4; 20 How. 328.),181
Indefiniteness and uncertainty defined. Examples.,CHAPTER LIX. INDEFINITE AND UNCERTAIN PLEADINGS. ARTICLE 1. Indefinitenees and uncertainty defined.,2. Remedy against such errors. ART. 1.-Ilnefinitenless and uncertainty defined. A pleading is not considered indefinite nor uncertain, if the precise nature of the charge or defence therein contained is apparent. (Code, Â§ 160.) Therefore indefi- niteness in allegations of matter which ought to come from the other side, such as admissions of part payment by the adverse party (Fan Denark v. FTa Demark, sp. t., 13 How. 372), or in allegations responsive to irrelevant matter in the adverse pleading (Parslhall v. Tillou, sp. t., 13 How. 7), cannot be objected to.,But if a pleading fails so to state the facts which it sets up as to enable the adverse party and the court to iden- tify the transactions to which it refers, and to comprehend the nature of the claim or defence which it contains, it is fairly open to objection on this ground. See on this sub- iect ante, p. 21, where authorities are citbd.,So if it is uncertain whether one claim or defense, or more than one claim is intended to be set up, the pleading may justly be censured as indefinite. (Clark v. Parley, 3 Duer, 645; Forsyth v. Edminston, sp. t., 11 How. 408.),Ezxamp)les.]-The following allegations, among others, have been criticised as too indefinite. An averment that a party was "compelled to pay," without saying how (Patten v. Foote, 1 Wend. 209; Pack7ard v. Hill, 7 Cow. 442;) that he was "duly appointed" administrator, re- ceiver, &c., without saying by what court (Sere v. Coit, sp. t., 5 Abb. 482; see ante, p. 84); or that he was " discharged by due course of law" (Ourrie v. Henry, 2 Johns. 433); that "a large sum" was illegally assessed (Heywood v.
Defined, Examples. Remedy against such errors. Btffalo, 14 N. Y. 544); that a judgment recovered by A. "belongs" to B. (Martin v. Kanouse, 2Abb. 327; 11 How. 567); or that B. is "owner by purchase" of a note payable to A. (Pritdle v. Ca rithers, 15 N. Y. 425; see Brown v. Richardson, 20 id. 472); that a note was given "by mis- take, for a greater sum than was due" (Seeley v. Engell, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 542; rev'g S. C., 17 Barb. 530); "that the plaintiff is indebted to the defendant on account of previous transactions" (Wiggins v. Gans, 3 Sands. 738; Code Rep. N. S. 117), or " for services," without showing what kind of services (Cliesbroutgh v. N. Y. & AErie R. R. C., sp. t., 26 Barb. 9; 13 How. 557; see Farcy v. Lee, sp. t., 10 Abb. 143); or that the defendant " wasted and mis- managed" certain property consigned to him. (WHITE, J., Webb v. Puttel, June, 1863). So, where it was essen- tial to a cause of action that a certain act should not have been done in January, 1858, an averment that it was not done "in January, 1855, nor at any time there- after," was held too indefinite, though not bad on demur- rer. (Andrews v. Murray, sp. t., 9 Abb. 13.) A negative pregnant, or conjunctive denial of several allegations, is liable to correction as indefinite (see Wall v. Buffalo Waterworks, 18 N. Y. 119; Dovan v. Dinsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503), but not on any other ground. (lb.),ART. 2.-Remedy against such errors. The court may require a pleading, indefinite or uncer- tain within the meaning of the rules heretofore stated, to be made definite and certain by amendment. (Code, 160.) Such amendment will be ordered on motion. This is the only remedy against such defects, except by procuring a bill of particulars or copy of account, in the appropriate cases. They cannot be reached by demurrer. (Ante, p. 123.) Though a party may sometimes have his choice be- tween demanding a bill of particulars or a copy of an,183
Remedy against. Motion. Affidavits on motion. account, and a motion of this kind (see Farcy v. Lee, sp. t., 10 Abb. 143), he cannot have both remedies for the same cause, and after procuring a copy of an account, even if it is defective, he cannot move to make the complaint more definite on points covered by the account. (MlcKinreyj v. MleKinney, sp. t., 12 How. 22.) And where a pleading could be made more definite only by giving the par- ticulars of numerous items, this motion is not favored, the proper remedy being by application for a bill of par- ticulars, or an account. (Cudlipp v. Whipple, 4 Duer, 610; 1 Abb. 106; St. .Tohn v. Beers, sp. t., 24 How. 377.),Only reasonable certainty can be required. The court will not compel a pleader to be precise in stating the contents of a writing which he has lost. (Kellogg v. Baler, sp. t., 15 Abb. 286.t,When mnotion must be made.]-This motion is subject to the same rules in regard to the time within which it must be made, as a motion to strike out irrelevant matter. All that is said upon that subject heretofore (ante, p. 178), is therefore equally applicable to this motion.,Affidavits on miotion.]-In general, no affidavit is neces- sary on this motion, but we can conceive of cases in which a pleading might seem, on its face, sufficiently definite, and which nevertheless might be quite otherwise, and in which the necessity of amendment could not be made apparent without an affidavit. For example, a defend- ant sued upon a note might have several notes outstand- ing, precisely similar in amount, payees, and date, to one of which he might have a good defense, and to the others none. We think that in case of the plaintiff's refusal to show him the note, he might properly move to have its number stated in the complaint, instead of resorting to the more tedious process of discovery and inspection. In such case an affidavit would clearly be necessary.,It has been intimated (Brown v. Southern Mlich. B. R.
Remedy against. Notice of motion. Order to make more definite. Co., sp. t., 6 Abb. 237) that no uncertainty would be remedied which did not appear on the face of the plead- ing; but the case is poorly reported, and no affidavit seems to have been used. NAotice of motion.]-The notice of motion ought, in our opinion, to state in what respect more definiteness is required, so that the adverse party may have an oppor- tunity to amend without waiting for an order; and no relief should be granted upon a mere general motion that the pleading "be made more definite." Such was the practice in chancery on exceptions to answers for insuffi- ciency (Stafford v. Brown, 4 Paige, 88), and at law upon special demurrers (Currie v. Henry, 2 Johns. 433; Snydler v. Croy, id. 428); for which latter proceeding this motion is a substitute (Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 425, 431; Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 Abb. 286), and to the former of which it also bears a close analogy.,Â§ 202. Notice of motion to mna;e a lleading more d(fintite.

Sham answers and defenses may be stricken out upon motion, and upon such terms as the court may, in its discretion, impose. (Code, Â§ 152.) Nothing less than an entire defense can be stricken out as sham (Slack v. Cotton, 2 E. I. Smith, 398), though of course any one of several defenses in an answer may be (see People v. MOcCwber, 18 N. Y. 31.5); and some of the defenses may be stricken out as sham, and judgment rendered upon the others as frivolous. (lb.),When nmotion must be nade.]-The motion may be made at any time before trial. (Miln v. bose, 4 Sands. 660.) The rules on this point, concerning motions to correct pleadings (ante, p. 178), do not apply to this motion. (lb.) But when leave has been obtained to serve an amended answer, a copy of which was served upon the plaintiff before the hearing of the motion for such leave, it is held that he cannot afterwards move to strike it out as sham (Mtssiuia v. Stillnan, 13 Abb. 93), even though he had no means, at that time, of knowing its falsity. (1b.) We much doubt, however, the correctness of this doctrine. The decision might be sustained on other grounds. Motion paplers.]-The motion must be made upon a notice, or order to show cause, which may be in the follow- ing form:,Â§ 204.

Wilton, 4 Sands. 708; and see ante, p. 154), the particular point on which it is alleged to be false should appear by an affidavit, which must distinctly show its fal- sity in some material point, but need not show that the defendant knows it to be false, for that will be presumed from its falsity. (See Darrow v. Miller, sp. t., 5 How. 247.) It will not suffice to state matter in avoidance of the answer. (See Wirgnmui v. Hicks, sp. t., 6 Abb. 17; Garyey v. Fowler, 4 Sands. 665.),A mere verification of the complaint is not a sufficient basis for this motion, even when made after service of an unverified answer. (White v. Bennett, sp. t., 7 How. 59.),Affidavit in ol)position.]-The defendant must, upon a prirfc facie case being made against the answer, produce his own affidavit, or that of some person better acquainted with the facts, reiterating the truth of the answer, or the motion will be granted. (People v. MlcCeumber, 18 N. Y. 315; aff'g S. C., 27 Barb. 632; 15 How. 186.) If the plaintiff has given positive evidence of the falsity of the answer, it has been held that a mere re-assertion of its thlth, upon information and belief, without stating the sources of such information, will not suffice (Corbettv. Elno, sp. t., 13 Abb. 65; see Miller v. Hughes, sp. t., id. 93 n.; 21 How. 442); but that decision was made under peculiar circumstances, which rendered it impossible that the defendant could be really prejudiced by striking out his answer. In another case, in which the defendant would have been deprived of a substantial right by strik- ing out his answer, a reiteration of its truth on belief, without stating the sources of information, was held sufficient. (Bailey v. Lane, 13 Abb. 354; 21 How. 475.) Even circumstantial evidence must be met by a satisfac- tory reply. (See Manufacturers' Bank v. Hitcltcoc;, sp. t., 14 How. 406.) 188

SNo more definite rule can be stated, for general appli- cation, than that the defendant must satisfy the court that he honestly believes his answer to be true. A mere affidavit to that effect may or may not be sufficient, because in some cases the court can plainly see that it is impossible for him to entertain such belief in good faith. If, however, the court cannot plainly see that this is the case, the motion should be denied (Farwers' & M2ech. Bank v. Smith, sp. t., 15 How. 329), even though it is morally certain that the defense is unfounded (ib.), the purpose of this motion being not to decide the issue, but simply to determine whether there really is any issue to be tried.

[As in Â§ 42, ante, i. 422, directing] that the answer in this action be stricken out as sham, with ........ dollars costs to plaintiff. Leave to answer anew.]-After an answer has been struck out as sham, the defendant cannot serve a new answer without leave of the court (Aymiar v. Chase, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 141), even though twenty days have not elapsed since the former answer was served. (lb.) A good excuse must be shown for putting in the sham answer, in order to induce the court to grant such leave, for a sham answer is presumptively an attempt to impose upon the court, and the defendant in such case can with but ill grace ask for a favor.,189

A complaint can never be treated as frivolous, but any other pleading may be, if within the rules hereafter stated. (See Code, Â§ 247.),No pleading is frivolous unless, admitting all the facts stated in it to be true, it is clearly and palpably insuffi- cient to constitute a defense or counterclaim, or (if it is a demurrer) plainly unfounded in law (Smith v. Mead, 14 Abb. 262; Shearman v. N. Y. Central Mills, 1 id. 187; Kelly v. Barnett, sp. t., 16 How. 135; Sixpenny Savings' Bank v. Sloan, sp. t., 2 Abb. 414; 12 How. 244; Leach v. Boynton, sp. t., 3 Abb. 1; 1ae v. Washington Mutual Ins. Co., sp. t., 6 How. 21; Nichols v. Jones, sp. t., id. 355), and this upon a bare inspection, without argument. (Ib.) If there is any doubt as to the sufficiency of the pleading (Smith v. Mead; Sheatran, v. N. Y. Central Mills, supra; Niblo v. Harrison, sp. t., 7 Abb. 447, n.), especially if it has been sustained by a decision of a judge of the court 190
What pleadings are frivolous. Examples. (attimer v. N. Y. Metallic Spring Co., sp. t., 9 Abb. 207, .), or if it even shadows forth a good case, though lacking some material averments (Kelly v. Barnett, supra*), it is not frivolous. The motive with which a pleading was put in, its truth or its falsity, has no bearing upon this question. (Hec7er v. Mitchell, sp. t., 5 Abb. 453.) If it is good on its face, it is clearly not frivolous (M3etropolitani Bank v. Lord, 4 Duer, 630; 1 Abb. 185; Lord v. Chesebrough, 4 Sands. 696; Temple7 v. 1Murray, sp. t., 6 How. 329), whether pleaded in good faith or not. (liecker v. Mitchell, supra.) When a pleading is clearly bad, according to authorita- ive reported decisions on the precise point, it must be regarded as frivolous, even though its insufficiency might be doubtful, apart from such authorities (Phelps v. Fergu- son sp. t., 9 Abb. 206 ; People v. M'Cumber, sp. t., 27 Barb. 632; 15 How. 186; affirmed, 18 N. Y. 315; see Strong v. Stevens, 4 Duer, 668; Cranmer v. Comlstock, sp. t., 11 How. 486); so, when a pleading is sufficient, upon the like authority, a demurrer thereto is frivolous, though the principle of the decision be doubtful. (Bank of Wilming- ton v. Barnes, sp. t., 4 Abb. 226.) An answer taking issue only on an immaterial allega- tion of the complaint is frivolous (Fairchiild v. Ogdecsburgl &c. R. R. Co., 15 N. Y. 337), even though such allegation is made in such form as to invite an issue.* (See ib.) Examnples.]-Answers have been adjudged frivolous which merely denied that the plaintiff was the owner or holder of a note sued upon, where the complaint alleged its being made or indorsed to him (Witherspoon v. VanDolar, sp. t., 15 How. 266; De Santes v. Searlc, sp. t., 11 id. 477; *Compare, however, Strong v. Slevens (4 Duer, 668). * Compare on this point the practice on moving to strike out such denial mirrelevant. (Ante, p. 180.),191
_ _ What pleadings are frivolous. Examplea see Smith v. Mead, 14 Abb. 262; Gilbert v. Covell, 16 How. 34; Higgins v. Rockwell, 2 Duer, 650; Fleury v. Roget, 5 Sands. 646) ;* or merely denied that the defendant was "indebted," where the complaint stated facts frol which indebtedness was a mere conclusion of law (Gilbert v. Covell, 16 How. 34; Pierson v. Cooley, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 91); or that he was "liable " (People v. McCumnber, 27 Barb. 632; 15 How. 186; affirmed, 18 N. Y. 315); or that the plaintiff was " entitled " to his demand (Drake v. Cockroft 4 E. D. Smith, 34; 1 Abb. 203; 10 How. 377); or, in an action of foreclosure against the mortgagee, denying only the recording of the mortgage (St. Mark's Fire Ins. Co. v. Harris, sp. t., 13 How. 95); or, in an action for an assault, denying only the circtunstances of aggravation. (Gilbert v. Houlnds, 14 How. 46; Lane v. Gilbert, sp. t., 9 id. 150.),So, an answer to a complaint upon a written agree- ment, setting up a cotemporaneous agreement in modifi. cation thereof, without alleging that it was in writing, is frivolous. (Bailey v. Lane, 13 Abb. 354; 21 How. 475; Elizab1eth7port Mfg. Co. v. Camplbell, sp. t., 13 Abb. 86; Flettry v. lioget, 5 Sands. 646.),An answer containing only a negative pregnant has been held frivolous (Shearman v. 1V. Y. Central Mills, 1 Abb. 187); but this is perhaps not consistent with later decisions, which seem to hold that the only remedy against such a defect is by motion to make the answer more definite. (See Wall v. Buffalo Waterworks, 18 N. Y. 119; Dovan v. Dinsmore, 33 Barb. 36; 20 How. 503.),A demurrer to a complaint on a note, on the ground that it is not averred that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of the note (Phelps v. Ferguson, sp. t., 9 Abb. 206; Appleby v. .Elkins, sp. t., 2 Sands. 673), or that it is not alleged that the note was delivered to the plaintiff (Eliza-,* In Temple v. iMurray (sp. t., 6 IHow. 329), su'h an answer was held not frivolous, the question of its sufficiency not having been then determined in a more formal manner.

Judgment may be obtained in a summary manner upon a frivolous pleading (other than a complaint) upon application to the court, or to a judge thereof out of court. (Code, Â§ 247.) Pleadings cannot be disregarded (Bergnman v. Hoiwell, sp.t., 3 Abb. 329; Strout v. Curran, sp. t., 7 How. 36; Hartness v. Bennett, sp. t., 3 id. 289; Swift v. De Wfitt, sp. t, id. 280; Corning v. -Iaight, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 71), nor stricken out (People v. lAcCtuiber, 18 N. Y. 315; Hull v. Smith, 1 Duer, 649; 8 How. 149), on account of mere fri- volousness, however gross. When motion to be nade.]-lThere is no time prescribed wvithin which this motion mist be made (Darrow v. Mil- ler, sp. t., 5 How. 247; and see ante, 187), and the plaintiff may move, even after replying to a frivolous answer. (Clihalncey v. HIodges, sp. t., N. Y. Trans., June 23, 1860; Stoles v. Hagar, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 84; 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 16.) Notice of motion.]-Only five days' notice of motion is required (Code, Â§ 247), but it seems that the time cannot be shortened by an order to show cause. (See Lefferts v. Slediker, 1 Abb. 41.) The notice must ask for judgment; not to have the pleading stricken out. Under a notice demanding that the pleading be stricken out, with no prayer for general relief, judgment cannot be granted (Rae v. Washington MutMal Ins. Co., sp. t., 6 How. 21), and it has been so held, where there was a prayer for "such other order as might be just" (Darrow v. Miller, sp. t., 5 How. 247), but, we thnk, erroneously, for this motion is an application for an,25,193

[As in Â§ 38, adte, i. 412, denmanditg] that judgment be ordered for the [plaintiff] on the [demurrer] herein, as frivolous.,Affidavit.]-No affidavit is necessary or useful on the motion, which is to be made solely on the pleadings, (Darrow v. 3i7ller, sp. t., 5 How. 247.),T7'7tel motioln will or will not be gradnted-.]-If any part of the pleading is good, the motion must be denied* (see Vran Yalen v. Laplbam, sp. t., 13 How. 240; MIetrololitan Banck v. Lord, 4 Duer, 630; 1 Abb. 185), for the Code gives no authority to render judgment under this motion for the frivolousness of part of a pleading. The remedy in such cases is by motion to strike out such parts as are irrelevant. Part of an answer may, however, be stricken out as sham, and judgment rendered on the remainder as frivolous. (People v. TeCucmber, 18 N. Y. 315.),The order.]-An order must be made and entered, directing judgment. A mere verbal direction would not suffice.,The order may be in the following form:,Â§ 207. Order for judgment on frivolous pleading. [As in Â§ 42, ante, i, 422, directin] that judgment be entered for the [plaintiff] on the [demurrer] herein, as frivolous.,* If De Santes v. Searle (sp. t., 11 lIow. 477) is to the contrary, it cannot be sustained. 194
Remedy against Leave to plead auew. Proceedings under the order. Leaee to plead anewv.]The judge who grants the order, whether in or out of court, has power to reserve in it leave to tle party against whom judgment is rendered, to plead anew. (Wlitierspoon v. Van Dolar, sp. t., 15 How. 266; Fples v. Hicks, sp. t., 12 id. 153.*) Where such leave is reserved, the order should direct judgment, "unless within ..-----. days from the [date or service] of this order, the [defendant] serves an amended [answer]." Such leave will not be granted to a defendant unless he swears to merits (Bank of Lowville v. .Edwlards, sp. t., 11 How. 218; Appleby v. E.lkins, sp. t., 2 Sands. 673) in the prescribed form. (Tompkins v. Acer, sp. t., 10 How. 309.) Nor will leave be granted to put in a defective pleading (Brown v. Ward, 3 Duer, 660); and we know of no case in which a party was allowed to denmur a second time, after hlls demurrer Iad been overruled as frivolous.; The unsuccessful party is entitled, in any case, if he desires it, to a reservation in the order of his right to move, at a special term, for leave to plead anew. (Mafr- qfisee v. Binghalm, sp. t., 12 How. 399; Tompkins v. Acer, 10 id. 309.) Proceedings tlnder the order.]-Upon entering the order, the successful party may take judgment precisely as in case of failure to answer or reply. (Code, Â§ 269; King v. Stafford, sp. t., 5 How. 230.) He is not at liberty to enter judgment for the amount demanded in his complaint, or counterclaim, without regard to the formalities prescribed in case of a default. (King v. Stafford, supra.) *To the contrary is a dictum in Shearman v. N T. Central Afills (1 Abb. 190).,195
When pleadings may be disregarded. Proceedings thereon.,CHAPTER LXII. DISREGARDING PLEADINGS. ARTICLE 1. When pleadings may be disregarded.,2. Proceedings on disregarding pleadings. ART. 1.-When pleadings mag be disregarded. A pleading may be disregarded, when served after the time to plead has expired (see Me(Gown v. Leavenwtorth, 2 E. D. Smith, 24; 3 Code Rep, 151), or when not properly folioed (see ante, p. 4; Rule 20, Supreme Court), or illegible (see ib.), or not subscribed by the pleader, or his attorney (see ante, p. 7), or (in case of an answer or reply), not properly verified (see ante, p. 41 ); and perhaps, if it is wholly unauthorized. (See Farrand v. Herbeson, 3 Duer, 655.,A demurrer to a complaint, which assigns no ground of objection whatever, may be disregarded (Code, Â§ 145); but not so if it states any ground, however frivolous and unwarranted. (Sw/ift v. Do WVitt, sp. t., 3 How. 280.),An original pleading cannot be disregarded merely because frivolous (ante, p1. 193,) or irrelevant. But an amended pleading, the amendments in which are clearly frivolous, if served immediately before a circuit, and obviously for the mere purpose of delay, may be disre- garded (Vanderbilt v. Bleeker, 4 Abb. 289; Allen v. Comlp ton, sp. t., 8 How. 251); and so may a pleading amended in a manner unauthorized by the Code. (Farrand v. Her- beson, 3 Duer, 655.),The only remedy against mere formal defects in plead- ings is by proceeding under this chapter. (Strauss v. Par. ker, sp. t., 9 How. 342.,ART. 2.-Proceedings on disregarding pleadings. A pleading disregarded must be returned to the pleader (Williams v. Sholto, 4 Sands. 641; Lainbeer v.

(White v. Cummings, 3 Sands. 716; Code Rep. N. S. 107; Broadway Bank v. Danforth, sp. t., 7 How. 264; Iaimbeer v. Allen, 2 Sands. 648; 2 Code Rep. 15; see Chemung Canal Bank v. Judson, sp. t., 10 How. 133.) Defects not specifically pointed out, will be deemed to be waived (ib.), unless in their nature abso- lutely incurable.* (Phillips v. Prescott, sp. t., 9 How. 430; see Farrand v. HIerbeson, 3 Duer, 655.) Re-service of returned pleading.]-If, after a pleading has been duly returned to the pleader, he sends it back again, it is not necessary to return it a second time. (Jacobs v. .arshall, 6 Duer, 689; Richardson v. Brooklyn k Newtown, . R. Co., sp. t., 22 How. 368.),CHAPTER LXIII. AMENIrMENT OF PLEADIXGS AS OF COURSE.t Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course (i. e., without applying to the court), and without costs (Code, Â§ 172), subject to the rules herein stated. Nothing but pleadings can be so amended. (M'Crane v. Mlollton, 3 Sands. 736; Code Rep. N. S. 157.) What pleadings are amendable.]-All pleadings are now amendable of course, including answers consisting of * See, on analogous questions arising under a contract, Friess v. Rider, (24 .Y. 367); Carman v. Pultz (21 id. 531); in which a similar rule is en- tAmendmcnts by leave of court being governed in many respects by PerIl rules, applicable to practice as well as pleading, the entire subject is ted of in chap. cxxxii, post.,197
When amendment may be made. Extension of time, denials only, which were formerly not thus amendable (see Lalmpsobs v. .McQteen, sp. t., 15 How. 345; l'arranld v. HIerbeson, 3 Duer, 655; Plu)lb v. WThipple, isp. t., 7 iow, 411), the reason for these decisions having been taken away by the amendment of Â§ 172, of the Code in 1859.,IFWhen ameldment ilay be niade.]-An amncndinfnt of course may be made within twenty days after the plead. ilng is served, or at any time before the period for answer. ing it expires, or within twenty days after the service of the answer or demurrer thereto. (Code, Â§ 172.),An amendment of course may be made within tlhe time here prescribed, notwithstanding the adverse party may have meanwhile noticed the cause for trial (t(srltbirnlt v. IIeirick, sp. t., 4 How. 15), or mlade any motion founded upon the original pleadillg. (Bnrrall v. Moore, 5 Duer, 654; Toll v. Cromwell, sp. t., 12 How. 79.),If a pleading is served by mail, as the adverse party has forty days to answer (Code, Â§ 412), the pleader has the like time to amend. (WVtshlburi v. IIerric, sp. t., 4 How. 15; see Plumlb v. 1Whipple, sp. t., 7 id. 411.),If the time for the adverse party to plead is extended, thle time for an amendmlen t of course is extended also (Jeroliman v. Cohlen, 1 Duer, 629!); and therefore, when a party has been ordered, on motion of the adverse lpary, to amend his pleading, his time to amend as of course in other respects, is enlarged to the extent of the time allowed him to amend under the order. (Ib.),Where an answer is amended, the time fQr the plaintiff to amend his complaint runs from the service of the amended, and not the original, answer. (Seneca Co. Banll v. Garlinghouse, sp. t., 4 How. 174.),Though leave to amend in a particular manner, or on special terms, has been granted by the court, the right of the party to amend of course is not thereby taken away (Ross v. Dins)ore, sp. t., 12 Abb. 4; S. C., less fully, 20 How. 328; Coolpr v. Jones, 4 Sands. 699), and this not- 198
When ame'ldment may be made. Effect on previous proceedings. Withstanding Faeh leave has been granted at the instance of the amending party (Ross v. Dinsmorc, supra), and though lie has given formal notice of his intention not to avail himself of it (Ib.), or has served an amended pleading nnder it, which has been returncd as irregular. (Cooper v. Jones, supra.) Aud though part of the pleading has been stricken out on motion, as redundant, the right to amend of course is not taken away. (Ross v. Dintsmnore, sp. t., 12 Abb. 4; 20 How. 328.) Amendmen7t allowed onlyi o0nce.]--A pleading can be amended as of course only once in the whole course of the.action (Code, Â§ 172), and therefore, if amended of coarse before it is answered or demnnrred to, it cannot be so amended afterward. (White v. Mayor of 1 Y., sp. t., 5 Abb. 322; 14 IHow. 496.) It has been intimated that an amendmend t made even under the order of the court, deprives the pleader of his right to amend of course (see .Terolilman v. Cohen, 1 Duer, C29), but if this is so, an order striking out matter as redundant is not an amendment within tle rule. (Ross v. Dinsmore, sp. t., 12 Abb. 4; 20 How. 328.) Where, however, a pleading has been amended, and a new answer served thereto, such answer may be amlended once of course, notwithstanding the answer to the origi- nal pleading may have been once amended, the original pleading and answer thereto being, for the purposes of the action, as though they had never existed. (See ost, y. 200.) Effect on previous procecdings.]-An amendment of course is not to prejudice proceedings already had (Code, { 172), and though by superseding the issue formerly joined it may be that it avoids a notice of trial previously served (Washibburn v. Ilerriek,c sp. t., 4 How. 15; see Cslson v. Whalon, sp. t., 5 lIow. 302), yet if the adverse aty proceeds under such notice to trial and judgment,199
Effect on previous proceedings. Amendment for mere delay not allowed before the amended pleading is served upon him, the judgment is regular, and must stand. (Plumtb v. Whipl)e, sp. t., 7 How. 411.*),The amended lcading k takes tile place of the original in every respect, and the latter ceases to exist for the purposes of the action. (Burrall v. Moore, 5 Duer, 654; Kapp v. Barthian, 1 E. D. Smith, 622 ; Seneca Co. Ban1i v. Garlinghousc, sp. t., 4 How. 174; see Brownt v. Saratoga 1. R. Co., 18 N. Y. 495.) And a demurrer, answer, or reply to a pleading is superseded by an amendment to such pleading. (Fry v. Bennett, 3 Bosw. 200.),After notice of motion for judgment on a pleading as frivolous, it may (provided the time prescribed for so doing has not expired) be amended of course, and if, as amended, it is not frivolous, the motion must be denied, though without costs. (Burrall v. Moore, 5 Duer, 654; Ctrrie v. Baldwin, 4 Sands. 690.) The same principle also undoubtedly applies to motions to strike out plead- ings or parts thereof as sham or irrelevant, and the deci- sions to the contrary (Williams v. W7ilkinson, sp. t., 5 How. 357; Code Rep. N. S. 20; see Aymtar v. Chase, sp. t., id. 141), ought not to be followed.,Amiiednent for mere delaeio/ not alloced.]-An amend- ment of course is not allowed, after service of the adverse pleading, for the purpose of delay; and if it appears to the court that such amendment is made for such purpose, and that the adverse party will thereby lose the benefit of a circuit or term for which the cause is or may be noticed, the amended pleading may be stricken out, and such terms imposed as may be just. (Code, Â§ 172.),Though, in general, an amended pleading cannot be * Morgan v. Leland (sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 123): and Tlashblu:'. v. lenrick (sp. t., 4 How. 15; 2 Code Rep. 2), to the contrary, were decided under the Code of 1848, which did not contain sucl a restriction on the power of amendment as that which we are now considering. 200
Amendments for mere delay not allowed. What amendments may be made. disregarded, but the question of its sufficiency must be submitted to the court (Griffin v. Cohen, sp. t., 8 How. 451), yet where an amendment is made, of a clearly frivo- lous nature, and manifestly with intent to throw the cause over a circuit for which it has been noticed, it may be disregarded, and a trial had upon the notice (Vander- bilt v. Bleeler, 4 Abb. 289; Allen v. Compton, sp. t., 8 lfow. 251); after which a motion may be made to strike out the amended pleading (Allen v. Compton, supra), though it does not seem to be absolutely necessary that this should be done. Where this course is adopted, the amended pleading must be returned in the manner prescribed, ante, 1. 196, or the proceedings will be irregular. (Rogers v. Rath7bun, sp. t., 8 How. 466.),What amenedments may be made.]-There is no restriction in respect to the nature of the amendment which may be made of course to a pleading (Macqueen v. Babcock, 13 Abb. 268; 22 How. 229; Watson v. Rushmore, sp. t., 15 id. 51), other than such as are laid upon all ori:nal plead- ings. A pleading may therefore be amended by the insertion of an entirely new claim or defense (Macqueeen v. Babcock, 13 Abb. 268 ;* 22 How. 229; Miason v. Whitely, 4 Duer, 611; 1 Abb. 85; Wyman v. Remond, sp. t., 9 How. 272), even though an unconscionable one (ib.), which the court would not, if it had any discretion in the matter, allow to be set up. (Ib.) So it may be amended by omitting an entire claim or defense (Watson v. Rushmore, sp. t., 15 Abb. 51; Wyman v. Remond, sp. t., 18 How. 272), and, it would seem to follow, by a total change of the nature of the action or defense, though this has not yet been actu- ally so decided. An amendment must be substantial in its character.,* Overruling lollister v. Livingston (sp. t., 9 How. 140).,26,201
What amendments may be made As to parties, It is not allowed for the purpose of correcting obvious clerical errors, which could inot prejudice either party (see rVanerbilt v. Bleeker, 4 Abb. 289), nor merely to put the same facts into different language, the legal effect of the amenlded pleading being precisely similar to that of the original (Siyd(r v. 7htite, sp. t., 6 How. 321), nor merely to verity an unverified pleading, for the purlose of complelling the adverse l)arty to verify on his part. (GCeore v. M-cAroey, sp. t., 6 How. 200.) Nevertheless, as the only purpose of such restrictions is to avoid prejudice to the rights of the adverse party, we have no doubt that a pleadling might be amended in any such way, provided a stipulation were served therewith to the effect that the date of the issue should remain unchanged, and the ans- wer of the adverse larty (if any) stand as if made to the iamended pleading, if lie so desired. A complaint cannot be amenlded of course by aldding or omitting a party (Russell v. S)pear, sp. t., 5 Iow. 142; 3 Code lepl. 189; see Follower Laughlin, 12 Abb. 105; Billi,!ls v. Baker, sp. t., 6 Abb. 213), nor by changing the delland of judgment from a claim for a liquidated debt iupon contract into a claim for special relief (Gray v. Browi, sp. t., 15 How. 555,) but this is simply l becaulse suchn amendments would make the complaint inconsist- ent witl the summons, and, therefore, irregular. Where the summons is for "relief," the prayer of the coml)laint nmay be varied by an amendment in any muanner, as by adding a prayer for an injunction to a prayer for mere damages. (Getty v. Hudson River RI. R. Co., sp. t., Ã³i How. 2().),A complaint may be amended by changing the trial county (Toll v. Cromwell, sp. t., 12 How. 79), and tils after notice of a motion to change the place of trial. (Ib.),A pleading cannot be anmended of course by inserting matters which have occurred since the service of tlhe original pleading (Iloriififer v. lIornfaqer, sp. t., 6 How. 13; see Beck v. Stephani, sp. t., 9 id. 193) as the only 202
What amendments may be made. Amended pleading to be served. proper method of setting up such facts is by a sppple- mental pleading (ib.); but an error in this respect is a mere irregularity. (Bcck v. Steli7ani, supra.),Amen(ldment as to namc)es.]-In case of a change in the name of a party, pending suit, the pleadings may be amenllded of course, without costs, by substituting his new namne, at any stage of the action. (Lat!ws 1S47, ch. 4(4.) And an amendment of this nature will not, we think, be considered as exhausting the right to amend of course. Perhaps a mistake as to the name of a defendant may be amenlded of course, whenever discovered. (See Code, Â§175.) Anclded pleading to be sertedl.]-The amendedl pleading: must be served upon the adverse party (Code, Â§ 172) within the time prescribed for making the amendment, for it is not considered as made for any purpose until served. Adverse pcarty may plead aneltw.]-After an amendmlent of course, the adverse party has a right to plead anew to the amended pleading. (Rictlardson v. Ric7l7rdson, 5 Paige, 58; see Trust & Tire Ins. Co. v. ,7Ten,ins, 8 id. 589; Bowen v. Idley, 6 id. 46; Barstow v. Randall, 5 ltill, 556.) And for this reason a judgment by default is waived by subsequently amnending the complaint.

A plaintiff is sometimes unable to frame his complaint with safety or justice to himself, without an examination of books or papers in the possession of the defendant. Still more frequently is the defendant unable to prepare his answer without a similar opportunity to examine documents held by his adversary. In the majority of cases, however, in which this remedy is resorted to, it is not necessary to be had until after issue joined, as the matter to be discovered is generally required only for the purposes of the trial. At common law, this remedy was ulobtainable except in a few special cases, and the party desiring it was com- pelled to file a bill in equity. (See Bank of Utica v. Hil- lard, 6 Cow. 62.) But the Revised Statutes conferred upon the Supreme Court power to compel, by a summary proceeding, a discovery of books and papers in the pos- session or power of an adverse party. (3 1l. S. (5th ed.) 293; [2 id. 199.]) The same power was afterwards extended to tihe New York Superior Court and Common Pleas, county courts, mayors', and recorders' courts, sub-
Of the proceeding in general. In what cases this remedy is alloled. ject to the nrles of the Supreme Court. (Laws 1841, 22, ci. 38; see Gould v. M'Carty, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 575.),The Code (Â§ 388) contains a provision somewhat similar, but this does not affect the remedy given by tle lRevised Statutes. (Gould v. M'Carty, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 575; Daris v. 1)Dnham, 13 How. 425.) The proceeding under the Code will be hereafter considered.,Thoulgh, before the Code, the statute on which this chapter is founded applied to actions at law alone, and the same proceedings could not be had in equity, yet it is hardly necessary to say that no such distinction now exists. (See Van SLantv. Eq. Pr., 57.),ART. 2.-In what cases tlis 'remned7 is allowed. Principles on which it is graltted.]-Tlie court is to be (overned, in granting an order for discovery, by thel rin- ciples and( practice of the court of chancery in its similar procee(lings. (3 1. S. (5th ed.) 293; [ 2 id. 199.]),These principles, so far as alplicable, require that the evidence to be discovered slould be material (,Story's Eq. PI. Â§ 324 a.; THoyt v. American Exchange Bani, 1 Duer, 656; 8 How. 93; Lane v. Stebbins, 9 Paige, 625); but it was not essential that the discovery should be indispensa- bly material, for it might be allowed ser the purpose of obtaining cumulative evidence. (Maric v. Davison, 9 Paige, 583.) But if the discovery is sought before pleading, there would seem to be reason in confining it to indispensable evidence, as in other cases the pleading could be framed with perfect safety without it. Accordingly it has been decided, at general term, that discovery will not be granted before pleading, unless the applicant is really unable, without it, to developo and secure all his rights in his pleading (Mlora v. M'Credy, 2 Bosw. 669; Gelston v. 1iMarshall, sp. t., 6 How. 398); nor will it be allowed, when its only use would be to satisfy the applicant that it would be unsafe for him to plead falsely. (Mora v. 111'Credy, supra.) 206
In what cases allowed. Discrction and power of the court. Discretioln (and power of the cotrt.]-Tlhe court may grant this order "in such cases as shall be deemed pro- per." (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 293; [2 id. 199.]),The Supreme Court is authorized to prescribe the cases in which a discovery may be compelled, by general rules (lb.), and it has done so (ante, i. 180), but the powers of the court are not restricted by these rules, and a discovery may be required in cases not provile(d for by them. (Gould v. 31'Carty, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 175.),Though it lhas been said that tllis order may be granted or refused at the discretion of tle court (leeler v. Dusen- bury, sp. t., 1 Ducr, i61); yet it is not to be understood that the jiuge to whoml tle application is made has an abso- lute discretion in the matter. If the party applying iiiakcs out a case within the purview of tle statute, hle has a right to the discovery, and the discretion of tile court extends only to the manner in which it may be made. (lloyt v. Americaln Exc7hantge Bank, 1 Ouer, 655; 8 How. 91.) It has been held that the discretion of tile court is so fir absolute tllat no appeal can be taken from an order granting a discovery, unless it exceeds the legitimate authority of the court, as by allowing a gene- ral inquisition into papers, or the like. (WVhite v. ftlluoe, 33 Barb. 650; 12 Abb. 357. But ill a better considered case the order was held appealable. (Isusson v. lox, 15 Abb. 464.) It is not a matter of course to grant a discovery, even where the applicant makes out a good case as fhr as ordi- nary circumstances are concerned (HIooker v. iMafltewvs, 3 How. 331; 3l'leon v. Lane, 2 Hall, 520); for if the court has reason to believe that the real object of the applica- ton is mere delay, it will not be granted (Hooker v. Math- eirs, supra); and if a notice to produce the documents at the trial (LM'Ieon1 v. Llne, supra), or a subpl)a'tn dluces teemi (Commercial Balnk of Albany v. Dunhanm, sp. t., 13 How. ;i1), or the testimony of witnesses, including that of the adverse party, will accomplish all that could be effected,207
In what cases allowed. Transactions with a deceased person. by an inspection of books and papers, there ought to be special reasons for granting it. (Comnmercial Bankl of Al- bany v. Dunlhanm, sp. t., 13 How. 541; Stalker v. Gaunt, sp. t., 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 132.),Before refusing the order upon these grounds, however, the court should be satisfied that these other remedies will subserve the purpose of the applicant equally well, and the order should not be denied for the mere reason that such other remedies exist. (Lefferts v. BraMplton, 24 Iowv. 257; Low v. Graydon, sp. t., 14 Abb. 443.),As the books of a corporation cannot be procured under a sutbpwna duces tecum (Lafarge v. Lafarge Insurance Co., 14 How. 26; Bank1 of Utica v. Hilltrd, 5 Cow. 419); this proceeding is the the proper method of putting them in evidelce, when the corporation is a party. (See LafJarge v. LafiJtre Insulrance Co., supra.),In ordinary cases, the court will only require sworn copies, of papers to which the applicant shows a right, to be furnished (Hoyt v. American Exchange Bank, 1 Duer, G52; 8 How. 89); but if it is deemed proper, the court may order the documents to be deposited with the clerk. (Rile 16, Sullreme Ct.),Transactions wiit7 a deceased perso)l.]-In an action by an administrator upon a promise made to him for the benefit of the estate, he may have a discovery of papers relating to the original transaction between the defendant and the intestate, inasmuch as that is the actual conside- ration for the promise. (Macthis v. sVanderbilt, sp. t., 2 Abb. 387.) Of course such discovery could be had in an action upon a promise to the intestate. (See ib.),But an application for the production of papers adverse to the interest of the estate of a deceased person, should be considered with caution, for if such person were living lie might be able to explain the circumstances connected with such papers much more fully than his legal represen- tatives can. (See Jackling v. Brozwn, 3 E. D. Smith, 539.) 208
In what cases allowed. Against whom. When not allowed. Il wchat actions.]-In equity, a party could not be com- pelled to make a discovery which would subject him to a penalty. (United States v. Saline Bank of Virginia, 1 Pe- ters, 104.) It seems, consequently, that a discovery of documents cannot be had in aid of a strictly penal action. (,lrKeon v. Lane, 2 Hall, 520.) An action to recover the statutory penalty from a witness for neglect to attend on subpoena, is not, however, considered a penal action. (MieKeol v. Lane, supra.) A discovery will not be ordered in an action evidently brought for the mere purpose of obtaining tile informa- tion for use in another proceeding. (Teml)erley v. Willett, 6 Ellis & B. 380.) Against whom.]-The Revised Statutes confer power upon the court only against parties to the action. (Low v. Gray(don, sp. t., 15 Abb. 464.) And at common law, the courts would not under any circmnstances compel a per- son, not a party, to produce his private papers before the trial. (Dave)nbagh v. 2PInCinie, 5 Cow. 27.) But a third person who has unlawfully obtained pos- session of a plublic document which ought to be filed in a public office, may be compelled to produce it when needed, before the trial. (People v. Til, 2 Cow. 623; 1 id. 589.) The order need not always be against an adverse party. A defendant may obtain it against a co-defendant. (See ChaurlicE v. Flutshing 1I. R. Co., 10 Abb. 131.) When not allowed.]-The order will not be granted when it appears that the adverse party has in good faith ofered the applicant free access to the papers desired, with leave to take copies. (MlcAllistcr v. Pond, sp. t., 15 how. 303.) Probably it would not be allowed even after such an offer was revoked, if it had been kept open for a reasonable time; as it would establish a case of unreason- able delay.,27,209
Whenl not allowed. What papers may be discoverd. A dliscovery will never be granted 1uponll : alal)lieation not nmade in good faith, for the Ilurloses professed. (Tein perh'y v. lVillett, 6 Ell. & B. 380; llooker v. Matliexs, 3 llow. 329.),ART. 3.-TtWhat lpaers may be discovered. The court has not the power, under the lIeisc d Sta- tutes, to give the alplicant access to any andl every paper which it mighlt bhe desirable for his interest that lle should see. No liscovery be compellled of papers that do not relate to tlhe merits of tle action or definse (3 Rl. &. (;5th ed.) 293) ; [2 id. 19!)]); nor even then, unless they are mmtetrial thereto. (IIoyt v. American Excha!uoj .7Bnr, 1 D)uer, i652; 8 11ow. 89!; Lane v. Stcbbias, 9 Paige, 625.) Indeed, it is olvious that all the ordilna: rules of evidelce llmst be ap)l)lied to dloculllments soughtl for under these pro- ee(lings, and that if llcey woull not be admnissible on the trial, their production ought not to be required.,Tlhe proceeding under the Revised Statutes being sub- ject to all the rules of equity in relation to (liscovry (2 ?. 8. 1)9), the decisions in equity are fully al)plicalble to it, antd are cited accordingly. It has been held, and we think justly, that an application for an inspection umnder the Code is not strictly governed b)y tlese decisions (Powers v. Elltmi(lorf, sp. t., 4 low. 60), though they have much weight by way of analogy, in so far as they are founded uponl principles of general application.,It was a rule in equity that documents, the discovery of which was sought, lmust be material (Lane v. Stebbils, 9 Paige, 625; Sto. Eq. Jur., Â§ 324 a.), though it was not required that they should appear to be indispcns(ble. (March v. Davison, 9 Paige, 583.) Where a discovery is sought before pleading, however, the applicant is required to show allnost as much as that the documents are really indispensable. (Mora v. fMcCredy, 2 Bosw. 669; Gelston v. Marshall, sp. t., 6 How. 398.) After pleading, the rule is less severe. 210

No one was allowed to examine documents cont;liiinig evidence for his oplponent, merely for the pr'- pose of finding solme flaw in that evidence (lb.; Sneider v. ilanlino, 7 Exch. 229!); Wright v. Mlsorrey, 11 id. 209; see IHtint v. Icwitt, 7 id. 226; Scott v. Walker, 2 Ellis & Bl. 563), or of finding out what hlis case is. (NieCiry v. O'Hlara, sl). t., 1 Barb. 484 ; see Shadwell v. Shadlwell, (i C. B. [N. S.] (689; Sneitder v. lManlino, supra; but see Brccoort v. Wlarner, sp. t., 8 IIow. 326.) But doctimencts which contain evidence on both sides ought to be produced (Riccard v. I.nclosure Conmmissioncrs, 4 Ellis & BI. 338 ; London Gats Litght Co. v. Chelsea, (i C. B. [N'. S.] 411; Burrell v. Nichol.son, 1 Myl. & Keen, 681 ; C'Umlb v. London, 1 You. & Coll. (C.

Beatcfrt, 1 Hare, 507; 1 Phlil. 20!); icnlned! / v. Green, 6 Siml. 6.) It is almost needless to say that no one is entitled to a geleral inspection of all or any of his adversary's books auld papers, on a mere speculative hope that lie may find somethingi to help himl. (H. sson v. Fox, 15 Abb. 464; Bre- root v. l:rlner, s)p. t., S IHow. 325; see Hoyt v. Amlerican Exczditne Bank, 1 Ducr, 652; 8 llow. 89 ; ')lpper v. Cham- bers, 7 Exch. 226.)

And even corrlespond. ence with a solicitor, where it appeared that his relation with the party was that of a business agent, and not that of a mere legal adviser, was ordered to be prolduced. (Ilampson v. JIampson, 26 Law Jour. [COh.] 612; Goo(ill v. Little, 1 Sim. N. S. 163; IHughes v. BitddulpIt, 4 Russ. 190.),There have been a number of cases il which the writ- ten statements of a parlty to his counsel were hlcil to be ulprivileged (ltdulc7lifb v. Fuirsman, 2 Brown P. C.

JLiTerool, id. 88; HIug hes v. lBiddulp,71 4 Russ. 190); and the general rule is now the other way.,When a book is produced, of which a portion is not proper evidence, the party producing it is ailowed to seal up such parts (Mlisiasell v.

What may be discovered. At what time. also a party to the action (Mlurray v. WTalter, supra); but an inspection on the premises may be ordered, though the joint owners are not all parties. (Skey v. Bennett, supra.) Of course the possession of the agents or servants of a party, or of any persons under his control, is regarded as his possession; and the fact that the documents are in ; foreign country is no objection to the discovery, though it will, of course, affect the time within which it will be ordered to be made. (Eager v. WViswall, 2 Paige, 369; Farlqutarsonl v. -Batl!four, Turn. & Russ. 190, 206; Free- man) v. IFairlie, 3 MIeriv. 44.) AnT. 4.-At wChat stage of the action a discovery imay,be had. The order may be granted at any stage of the action before vcrdict. Thus it may be granted to enable the plaintiff to pre- pare his complaint, or reply (Rl7e 14, Suplreme Ct'.), or the defendant to frame his answer (id.), or to enable either party to prepare for trial. And it has been ordered pending a trial before referees (Mchbanics' 'Bank7 v. James, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 4(); but the case must be a strong one to justify it. (Jackson v. Ires, 22 Wend. 637.) It may be granted to enable a party to give a bill of particulars. (B3rccoort v. Warner, sp. t., S How. 321; Prince v. Currie, sp. t., 2 How. 119.) It seems that it will not be granted to enable the plaintiff in a libel suit to frame his complaint, unless strong aflidavits are made to show its necessity (Keeler v. Ditsenbiry, sp. t., 1 ])uer, 601; see Lynch v. Henderson, sp. t., 10 Abb. 345, 1i.), nor in any easa to aid in preparing a complaint where the nature of het action is not shown in some way other than a mere summons. (lb.)

(See antc, i. 275.) The eases to lhe contrary (6 Cow. 59; 19 Johns. 268) were decided prior to the Revised Statutes, and another case since tile enactment of the statute (18 Wend. 529), refers only to circuit judges,-an1 office which no longer exists.

This application should usually be made in writing, and shouldl, it is alm1ost needless to say, be put in the Ibrm of a request rather than a dlema nl. It may well be doubted whether a peremptory demand would be regarded by tlle court as a request, within the meaning of the rule in relation to costs. Care should be taken to include in the request only such papers as the applicant has a right to see; though, on the other hand, if the adverse party intends to base his refusal on the ground that too much is asked, he ought to state that oljection at the time, specifying what papers he declines to exhibit. !Votice.]-Tlie application should usually be made on the usual notice of eight days, unless an order to show cause within a less time be obtained, though it seems firom the language of the statute that tlhe order may, in the discretion of the court or judge, be made cx parte.

It is, however, our duty to express our convic iion tllat these decisions have, in one or two material sea- tnres, widely deviated from the doctrines of equity, by 218
Mode of application. What must be stated in the petition. which the statute declares that such applications are to be governed, and which the julges supposed that they were following. The points upon which we submit that the judges have erred are (1) in requiring the applicant to allege that lie has no other available necanls of proving the facts, than the documents which lie seeks to inspect, and (2) in requiring hinl to specify and describe the documenlts which he wishes to discover. Upon the first point we are unable to entertain any doubt. It is perfectly true that therere e cases in equity in which the general rule is stated to be that the appli- cant must show that lie cannot prove his case at law without the discovery sought for (Lane v. Stebbins, 9 Paige, 622; Gelston v. ]IHot, 1 Johns. Clh. 543; and other cases.) But in every one of these cases it will be found that the discovery was sought after an action had been commenced at law, and that an injunction against that action was demanded by the bill. Wherever that, or indeed any general relief was prayed, equity very justly required that the necessity of its interference should be clearly established. But where a siimple discovery was asked, leaving the action at law to take its course, it was well settled that no such averment or proof of necessity was required. (M1 rch v. Davison, 9 Paige, 580.) And in the numerous cases in which courts of equity have been appealed to for the production of documents in suits pending it those colrts, no such allegations have ever been required. AVe have carefully examined thirty or more such cases in tile English courts, including all reported during the last twenty years, and find no case in which such an averment was insisted upon, or in which the report slows it to have been lmade. The reason of tile distinction is obvious. So grave an inter- ference with the proceedings of another court as is involved in an injunction to stay an action at law ought,219
MIode of application. What must be stated in the petition. not to bo allowed without strong reasons, not merely showing its desirability, but its positive necessity. But whenl no such interference is asked, it is almost a matter of course in equity to compel each party to disclose to the other all that lie knows of the case, whether it be in his own mind or recorded on paper, and whether the adverse party has other means of proving the same facts, or not.,Upon the second point we have but little more doubt. It is ever to be borne in mind that all actions now are ill equity as much as in law, and equitable rules are to be applied to the simplest action upon a money demand, as fully as to an action for specific performance. (Code, Â§ 69; Plillips v. Gorham, 17 N. Y. 270; N. Y. Ice Co. v. North- iwestcrIL Ins. Co., 23 id. 357; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. Nat. Prot. Ins. Co., 14 id. 90.) The application under the Itevised Statutes is a proceeding in the action, and not a separate affiir. It should be governed, therefore, by the rules of equity concerning sinlilar applications in al equitable action having no connection with any other suit. Now in every equitable action, it was the settled practice of the court to require the deflendant to annex to his answer a schedule of all documents wllich the plaintiff charged him witl having, and alleged to relate to the sullject of tile action. (Wigramn on Disc., Â§ 285; see Storny v. jLenox, 1 Keen, 350; 1ilightt v. Va(tecfo)lrd, 2 You. & Coll. 22.) The plaintiff was at liberty to describe them in the most general way, and usually averred, before the latest changes in tlhe Englisl practice, that the defendant had " certain accotuts, books, papers, documents," &c., &c., ' by which tlle truth of the matters" stated in the bill would appear. (Ib.; see also Adams v. Fisher, 3 MIyl. & Cr. 526; lMansell v. Fceeney, 2 Johns. & 1Ienl. 318.) On this charge le proceeded to interrogate the defendant. Under the present English chancery practice, no charges are necessary, and the plaintiff proceeds to interrogate 220

There are ninety-nine cases of unjust concealment to one of unljust exposure. The adverse party is abundantly protected by the rule which exempts his papers from examination upon his own un- supported oathl, as we shall show when we come to that branch of our subject.

Though tile strict terms of lRule 15 (a(te, i. 181), seem to require the ((ffidalit to state that tile books or papers desired are not in tile possession or under the control of the petitioner, yet the same purpose is accomplished by insertilg such an averment in the petition, and it seems to us much better to do so, and to confine tlhe affidavit to its proper purpose as a simple verification. The affidavit must, of course, distinguish between.allc- gations made uponl knowled(ge, and( thlose made luponl information and belief, and tile simplest method of doing this is to state all matters positively in tile petition, and specify in tile affidavit the particular avermenits wv ceh are made upon information ayd belief.

Denial.]-Sulpposing the papers aud proceedilngs of the moving lparty to have been correct, the first groulnd of 01l)osition to the application will be the non-existence, or want of possessiol or control of the papers described. A direct andi uile(iqivocal denial of tile existence of the dociuelunts, or tlie party's Iossession or control of, or over them, is, in general, a conclusive answer to the apllica- tion. (lradstreet v. Bailey, sp. t., 4 Abb. 233; A1hollke v. lVolott, sp. t., id. 41; Hoyl v. Am. 1:Exch. Bk., 1 IlDer, 652; 8 llow. 89.) But an evasive answer will not be regarded (Iicks v. Chiarlick, sp. t., 10 Abl. 129; Southart v. )Dightt, 2 Sands. 672); anl( where the petition averred positively that, at a certain time, the adverse party hlad possession of certain documents, it was held that the opposing affidavit ought either to deny that such party had possession thereof at tile time stated in the petition, or to show how, lwhen, alnd to wholli lie hlad parted wtith such possession. (1Iicks v. Charlick, supra.) An affidavit merely allegingl tlhat at the time at which it was made tile deponent had not possession of, or control over the docu- ment, was held, under these circumstances, evasive and insufficient. (Ib.; see Shaw v. Hlolmes, 3 Corn. Bench, 952.) If, however, the possession of the documents is admit- ted, the possessor may still assign a reason for refusing,223

(Taylor v. Milner, 11 Ves. 41; see IIhughes v. Bi(dd(ph, 4 Russ. 190; Ventt v. l'acey, id. 193.) Such an admission threw the burden of lpoof upon)l the defendant, to show that they did not tend to prove tle )lainltiff's case. (S8m)ith v. Bcattfort, 1 Hare, 507; 1 I'hil. 209; Storey v. Leotox, 1 M3yl. & Cr. 52.5; Tyler v. Drayton, 2 Simi. & Stu. 309); .7liuclll v. lBadell, 1 hlare, 527.) And it was not sufliciuet for this purpose, to allege, in general terms, that the documenlts woui(l not show the truth of the plaintiff's case (S'mitbh v. Beaul/fort, 1 Hare, 507, 517; 1 Phil. 209); or that they contained evidence for the detn'ed- ant, and not for tile plaintiff (Fir.kir v. Lowe, 13 Price, 193, 200; (5Newtoin v.

Mllousiesl, 2 Kay & Johns. 288.),The d(efndant must, it was held, distinctly state on his oath, that the dociuments did not, any of them, relate to, or tend to show, not only the title of the pllintiff to the property to be recovered, but to any of tle relief which he sougiht (Fellki v. Herbert, supra.), and further that it contained nothing whatever impeaching the detcldan;t's case, but did not contain evidence in support of it. (Combe v. London, 1 You. & Colly. Ch. 651.) This oath had, more- 224

If, consistently with the truth of the answer, it was possible that a document might con- tain matter impeaching the defendant's case, it was not protected. (Comnbe v. London, supra.) It was the defend- ant's business to make the point entirely clear. In one case, however, in which the nature of the documents was left in doubt, the judge examined them himself, to deter- mine whether they ought to be produced. (Lafoinev. Falkc land Islands Co., 27 LawV Jour. [Oh.] 25.),The principles here stated are, as we conceive, those which should guide the courts of our state in dealing with applications for discovery and inspection, rather than the more rigid rules which have been derived fromn the special practice upon bills of discovery anl relief in chancery, which, as we have heretofore shown (ante, p. 219), were governed by peculiar rules, and restricted within certain defined limits, ser reasons which have not the slightest application to any other proceeding. Let it be remem- bered that ereym action is now, in effect, an action in equity, and that every remedy which equity gave is now the right of suitors in actions of every description, and the dilliculties which have embarrassed our courts in deal- ing with this subject will, for the most part disappear. It was the policy of equity-so far from discountenanc- ing the examination of parties, as did the common law- to subject the defendant to a searching examination in the very beginning of every suit. IH was the first, and often the only witness called, and the court would "wring his conscience" to compel him to reveal not only all that he 7clew, but all that he believed, or supposed, or had ever said, done, written, or even thought, which might have a bearing upon the controversy. (See Bolton v. Liverpool, 1 Myl. &. K. 38.) Our court of last resort has very wisely and justly en- forced these doctrines of equity in favor of both parties,,29,225
Opposing the alplication. The order. by allowing them to testify as to their thoughts, e. g., as to their ilntentions, where material (Seymour v. Wiison, 14 - . Y. 5067; Pope v. Hart, 35 Barli. 630; 23 How. 215; 3Â£at7h1ces v. Poultnet, 33 Barb. 127), or as to their belief (BIush v. Lathrop, ,22 N Y. . 550); and, as a correlative proposition, it has also been rightly held that they may be compelled by adverse lparties, to testify as to the same matters. (IForbs v. rWller', 25 N. Y. 430; ar'gf S. (., 4 Bosw. 475.) The same principles will al)bln(latly sustain the doctrines which we he have ere asserted in regard to the discovery of do(cumenlts.,T'he court will limit tile (iscovery to suclh parts of the l)ooks or papers as are necessary, ald grant permlission to seal up tlhe rest (see HunI t v. Hewtitt, 7 Excl. 244), or it may limit tile order to a requirement of sworn copies of such entries as arc essential to he ilnspected byl the peti- tioner. (See JIo!t v.

(See ante, i. 427, 428.) If made at chambers, the caption should be omitted, and it will be signed by the judge, instead of the clerk, as in the preceding forms. When settled, a copy of the order slould be served on the party required to make the discovery. As no process for contempt is to be founded upon it, personal service is unnecessary.,ART. 9.-Stay of proceedings. It is not necessary for the applicant to procure any special order for the stay of proceedings in the action. The order for discovery operates, without any express words to that effect s as stay of all other proceedings until it has been complied with or vacated; and the party obtaining the order has the same time to prepare his pleading, if any, after the order has been comnplied with or vacated, to which he was entitled at the making of the order.

(Hoyt v. American Exchange Bankl, I Duer, 652; 8 How. 89.) And so, if part of the documents produced under an order for inspection are sealed, and the petitioner has reason to believe that matters which pertain to the discovery are sealed, he should apply for a further discovery.

Upon satisfactory evidence that it ought not to have been granted;,2. Upon the discovery sought being made; 3.

Vacating order. Motion papers. Denying possession. Motion papers.]-Tlie motion should be made on the usual notice or order to show cause, and on affidavits establislhing sufficient grounds within the statute, copies of which must be served with the notice, unless the appli- cation is made to the officer who granted the order, when, if the order was granted without notice, the motion to vacate it may also be made without notice. (Ante, i. 118, 432.) If the motion is based upon a denial of possession or control of the documents, such denial must be fully and unequivocally expressed in the affidavit. (Soutthart v. Dlwight, sp. t., 2 Sands. 672; Shawm v. Holmnes, 3 C. B. 952.) If it is attempted to be shown by circumstances that they are not in the possession of the moving party, such evi- dence must be complete and satisfactory. (Ib.) It has been held at special term, that if the affidavit follows the language of the statute, and expressly denies possession or control of the documents, that the order mutst be vacated, notwithstanding the circumstances of the case may throw great doubt on the good faith of the statement. (Ahoyle v. IWolcott, sp. t., 4 Abb. 41; see Brad- street v. Bailey, sp. t., id. 233.) But this ruling seems to us entirely unfounded. In the first place, thle statute does not imperatively require the court to vacate the order, even when a case is made out witin its terms;- secondly, it may well be doubted whether the spirit of the statute is complied with by simply denying present pos- session, for if it were, the party ordered to make the dis- covery might dispose of the documents after service of the orde(r and escape scatheless. It seems only reasonable that Ill affiant should either deny ever having had pos- session or control of the documents, or should account satisfactorily for the loss of such control. And if he does not do so explicitly ai(d sufficiently, the order should not be vacated. This is the English doctrine, and that of a late case in New York. (Hicks v.

But it is well settled that the remedy given by the Code is concurrent with the other, and that either nmay be resorted to at will (Golnd v. iM'C(fartq, 11 N. . [1 Kerll.] 575); and the moving party may avail himself of tle provisions of the Code and Itevised Statutes in a silnle proceeding (Lovell v. Clarke, sp. t., 7 Ilow. 158), which course will be found, upon examination, to be ligllly advisable.,The Code directs that either party may apply to the court, or a judge thereof, for an order upon another party 234

(Code, Â§ 388.),AnT. 2.-In Tlht cases alloitvel. Though in general, the remarks under a corresponding head of the last cllapter (ante, p. 206), are applicable to the proceeding under the Code, yet the court is not bound by the doctrines or lractice of chancery, as it is when acting under the Revised Statutes. (Powers v. lmelndlor,, sp. t., 4 How. CO.) The order maly be granted or refused in the discretiol of the court or juldge. (Code, Â§ 388.) But it cannot be granted against one who is not a party to the action. (lb.),ART. 3.--What paperl s mal, be itnspected. Tle corresponding article of the last chapter ((atle, p. 210), is applicalble to this, except that wlien the appli- cation is madle after issue, and for the purpose of preparinl for trial, the court may order papers to be produced tlat relate solely to the evidence of the party required to pro- duce them, which cannot le (lone undler the iRevised Statutes. (Powers v. EleCndorf, sp. t., 4 1Iow. 0.() Of colrse, no papers can be required, that are not in the possession or unlder the control of the party against wholl the notion is made. (Code, Â§ 388.),ART. 4.--'Thc atpllicattion. iWhlen to b1)e ade.]-Altlough it has been said that the proceedingl under the Code should only be adopted after issue, and for the purpose of preparing for trial (Va((l Snlt;. Eq. Pr. 273 ; 1 Whitt. Pr. [2t ed.] 613); the cases cited do not sustain this doctrine, and it has no shadow of foundation in reason except the use of the word " evi- dence " in Â§ 388, and this is really of no importance. We are decidedly of opinion that the order may be granted to aid a party in pleading as well as in his preparation,235
The application. To whom to apply. Motion papers. for trial, and such a course has been taken in reported cases. (Miller v. Mather, sp. t., 5 How. 160; Powers v. Ehnendorf, sp. t., 4 How. 60.),To whont to apply.]-The application may be made to the court, or a judge thereof (Code, Â§ 388); or, if the action is in the Supreme Court, to any officer, we presume, authorized to perform the duties of a justice out of court.,A'otion papers.]-Tlhe application lmust be made on notice, or on an order to show cause. (Code, Â§ 388.),It has been held that it must be made upon petition, and cannot be granted upon affidavits only (Dole v. .1el- lows, sp. t., 5 How. 451); but we believe this decision to have no just foundation, and think that the motion may properly be made upon affidavits. (See Exchange Bank v. Monlteath, sp. t., 4 How. 282.) And it seems that these affidavits need not in every case be made by the moving party (ib.), but as all the facts which are necessary to be shown upon an application under the Revised Statutes must also be shown in a proceeding under the Code, the affidavit should always, if possible, be made by the applicant; and for the sake of uniformity, it will be quite as well for him to apply upon petition, though, as before stated, we do not consider it necessary to do so.,Before the last change of the rules, it was said by HARRIs, J., (Exchange Bank v. .otcnteath, supra:) that they did not control this proceeding; but the rules of 1858 provide for discoveries both under the Code and the Revised Statutes, and therefore all the facts specified as necessary under the latter, ante, p. 216, must appear in the motion papers in the present case.,It will always be advisable, for reasons which will plainly appear in the next article, to frame the applica- tion so that relief can be granted under either the Code or the former statute. 236

[As in Â§38, ante i, 412, demanding an inspection and copy of [specijf the documents]. The form of petition given ante, p. 222, will be suffi- cient under the Code. AnT. 5.-The order, and powers of the court concerning it.,Discretion of the colurt.]-Though it is in the discretion of the judge to whom the application is made, to grant or refise the order (Code, Â§ 388), yet if the order is granted at all, it must authorize an inspection (see Joyt v. American Exchange Bank, 1 Duer, 652; 8 How'. 89); and, therefore, it seems that an application under the Code alone will be denied altogether unless as strong a case be made out as woul(l justify an order for plroduction and deposit under the Revised Statutes. (lb. But compare Exchange Bank v. 3Montcath, sp. t., 4 How. 282.),Form and contents of the order.]-The order must specify the time and place of the inspection, and prescribe the penalty of disobedience. (Rule 16, Supreme (Ct.),It ought not to require the documents to be deposited with the clerk of the court. (Pindar v. Seaman, 33 Barb. 140.) The place of inspection is usually at the office of the attorney for the party to whom the documents belong. (See Powers v. Elmneldorf, sp. t., 4 How. 63.) The penalty for non-compliance may be by precluding the use of the documents in evidence, or by other punishment, as men- tioned in the next article.

Belts, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 183), or if the summlons gives notice that the plaintiff will take judgmleut for a specific sum of money, and also apply to the court for other relief (see Baxter v. Arnold, sp. t., 9 lhow. 447), or if signed by an "agent" instead of an ' attorney" (WVeir v. Slocum, sp. t., 3 How. 397); or, perhaps, if the defendant's name is not given in the summons, and it does not allege the plaintiff's igno- rance thereof. (Crandall v. Beach, sp. t., 7 1-ow. 271; Elli- ott v. Hart, sp. t., id. 25.),All objections of this character must be raised before appearing in the action. (See ante, i. 389.),Setting aside provisional r'needy.]-It has been held in two cases, both at special term, that a motion to set aside proceedings on a requisition for chattels, on account of defects manifest on the face of the papers, must be made before appearing generally in the ac ion, or the objection 240
Setting aside provisional remedy. Receivers. Infants. Appearance. would be waived (Hyde v. Patterson, sp. t., 1 Abb. 248; Roberts v. Willard, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 102), but these decisions are clearly erroneous, being founded exclusively on the old practice in replevin, where the proceedings to recover possession of the property formed the actual coin- mencement of the suit. And they have been properly overruled in the Superior Court of 3uffalo. (Bunnell v. Tuapper, sp. t., Clinton's Dig. 2734.) When, however, a motion to set aside any provisional remedy is founded upon defects in the summonos, or its service, it must unqulestionably be made before appear- ing generally in tlhe action. (See Bedell v. Sturta, sp. t., 1 Bosw. 634; 6 Abb. 319 n.) Receirers.]-A receiver, when sued as such, should apply to the court by which lie was appointed for leave to appear and defend. For if lie defend without leave, and fail in the action, he cannot elfarge the costs to the estate. (Svaby v. Diekon, 5 Sim. 631; see Anon., 6 Ves. 287.) Inlfants.]-An infant defendant must have a guardian ad litem appointed for hlin, before appearing in the action (see ante, i. 490), for none of his own acts would bind him.,ART. 3.-A1ppearance. A defendant may voluntarily appear in any action in which he has been made a nominal party (Wellington v. Cluassen, sp. t., 9 Abb. 175; 18 How. 10; Higgins v. Rockirwll, sp. t, 2 Duer, 650), even against the will of the plaintiff. (Ib.) An infant may appear in this manner, by his guardian (Rogers v. iM'Lean, 11 Abb. 455; Wellington v. C1Gassen, sp. t, 9 Abb. 175; Varian v. Stevens, 2 Duer, 635, affirmed in Court of Appeals, see 11 Abb. 443), and so may a luna- tic or idiot, by his committee (Rogers v. M'Lean, 11 Abb.,31,241

ART. 1.-W7tat proceedings must be had before pleading, if,at all. The defendant should, before serving an answer, con- sider whether he has occasion to resort to any of the proceedings mentioned below, as none of them can be had after answering.,1. Demand of copy complaint.]-If the complaint has not been served with the summons, the defendant should demand a copy of it. (See ante, i. 361.) 242
Demand of copy complaint. Copy of accourt, or bill of particulars. The defendant will not be allowed I o serve an answer until he has had an opportunity of seeing the complaint (Phillips v. Prescott, sp. t., 9 How. 430); though it seems that one of several defendants may answer a complaint served on his codefendants, though not served upon him. (See Wellington v. Claassen, sp. t., 9 Abb. 175; 18 How. 10.) For the manner of making this demand, see ante, i. 361. 2. Dismissing complaint for want of service.]-If the complaint is not served within twenty days after demand thereof, the defendant may move to dismiss it. For pro- ceedings on such motion, see post, chap. lxviii. 3. Setting aside conmplaint.]-If the complaint is irregu- lar in any respect not a ground for demurrer or special motion, a motion to set it aside will be proper. This motion may be made after appearance, but before answer. (Tuttle v. Smith, 6 Abb. 329.) 4. Motion to nmake more definite or certaini.]-This motion must be made before answering or demurring, and within 20 days after service of the complaint. (Rule 50, Supreme Ct.) For proceedings on this motion, see ante, chap. lix, 5.

For proceedings on this motion, see ante, chap. lviii. 6. Copy of account, or bill of particulars.]-These must, it is obvious, be applied for before answering; and, it seems reasonable to judge, before demurring. For proceedings to obtain them, see ante, chaps. xxxix., xl., pp. 43, 47.,243
Order of interpleader. Security for colsta 7. Order of interp)leatder.]--An order of interpleader must be applied for before answer (Code, Â§ 122), and on principle, no doubt, before demurrer.,For proceedings on such application, see ante, i. 517. S. Discorery in aid of pleading.]-Thougl a discovery of books and papers, ulnder Â§ 388 of the Code, or 2 I.

(Code, Â§ 148; Zabriskie v. Smith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 33C.),For proceedings on demurrer, see ante, chap. xlviii. p. 122.,ART. 2.--What proceedings gmay be uad before or after,pleading. There are certain proceedings which may be taken either before or after answer or demurrer,-some at the discretion of the dlefendant, and others according to the grounds on which they are based. These are as follows:,1. Security for costs.]-In the cases specified by law, the defendant may apply for an order requiring the plaintiff to file security for costs, at any time before or after answer, up to judgment (Butler v. Wood, sp. t., 10 How. 314; Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 id. 495; Abbott v. Smith, sp. t., 8 id. 463), though if the cause is allowed to go to trial, the motion may be denied on the ground of laches (Swai v. Mathews, 244
eourity for costs. Offer to allow judgment. Tender. Consolidation. 3 Duer, 613; Florence v. Bulkley, 1 Duer, 705), and for this reason it is best to move promptly, and almost always the motion is made before answering. For proceedings on this application, see post, chap. lxxiv. 2. Offer to allow judqmenclt.]-Tle ldefendant may, at any time before trial or verdict, offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified amount or purplose, with costs. (Code, Â§ 385.) For the manner, and advisability of making this offer, see post, chap. Ixxvi. 3. Tendler.]-The defendant may also, in actions for sinus certain, or capable of being reduced to certainty by calculation, or for casual or involuntary injuries, tender to the plaintiff, at any time before trial, any sum of money, as damages and costs up to that time. (3 1. S. (5th ed.) 861; [2 id. 553].) For the nmnner of making tender, a 1 the advantages gained thereby, see post, chap. lxxv.,4. Motion to cha7nge llace of trial.]-Tlhe defendant may move, either beifre or after answering, to change the place of trial to the proper county. (Hubbard v. National Protection Insrloance Co., sp. t., 11 How. 152.) But if the motion is based upon any other ground, it cannot be made until issue has been joined. (lMerrill v. Grinnell, sp. t., 10 How. 32; IIartmlan v. Spencer, sp. t., 5 id. 135; Mlixer v. Kithn, sp. t., 4 id. 409.) 5. Consolida(tion.]-Whlen several actions are brought against a, defendant on causes of action which may be joined, he may move to consolidate as many of them as are brought in one court, or if some are brought in the Supreme Court, and some in other courts, they may all be consolidated in the Supreme Court. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 66; [2 id. 384].)

Curtis, sp. t., 7 How. 478; see Colvin v. Bragden, sp. t., 5 id. 124; Littlefield v. Murin, sp. t., 4 id. 306.) For other instances in which proceedings may be taken under this section, see post, chap. lx: i. For the manner of demanding service of the complaint, see ante, i. 361. The plaintiff cannot prevent the success of this motion by serving the complaint after he has received notice of the motion. (Baker v. Curtis, sp. t., 7 How. 478; Colvin v. Bragden, sp. t., 5 id. 124.),By wchom th7e motion may be mlade.]-If there are several defendants, of whom some have, and some have not been served with the complaint, only those who have not been served can move on that account to dismiss the colm- plaint. (Travis v. Tobias, sp. t., 7 How. 90.) Any person named as a defendant in the summons may appear, and demand a copy of the complaint, although he has not been served with the summons; and he will have the same right to move for a dismissal for want of service, as any other defendant. (See ante, i. 392.) Such at least are our views, notwithstanding the case of Tracy v. Reynolds (sp. t., 7 How. 327), in which HARRIS, J., denied such a motion on the part of a defendant not served with summons, on the ground that he had no interest to pro- tect. (See Wellington v. Claassen, sp. t., 9 Abb. 175.),ART. 2.-Proceedings on tte wmotion. rlrhere to move.]-The mot' i must be made before the special term (except in the city of New York), and in the judicial district which includes the county in which, according to the summons, the complaint will be filed, or in a county adjacent to that county.

(See (ote, i. 409.),Motion papers.]-TIie motion must be made on the usual notice, and on aflidavits showing the service of the summons, the demand of a copy of the complaint, and the non-service of the same. It will be rarely possible for one person to have personal knowledge of these facts, and therefore two or more affidavits must be used, or one aflildavit can be prepared for two persons, according to the form given below.,Â§ 215.

But if the motion is really well founded, tle best course to pursue will le to offer to stipulate for service within a short time, andl for payment of a reasonable amount of costs. The court will seldom allow full costs after such an offer has been made and refused. It will be unavailing to serve the complaint, without an offer of costs, after service of notice of motion. (Bakcr v. Curtis, sp. t., 7 How. 478; Colvin v. Bragden, sp. t., 5 id. 124.),ART. 3.-The order anl proceedigs thereon. If the demand of, andl failure to serve a copy of tile complaint within the proper time, are clearly provedl, the court should grant the order of dismissal, and its effect will be to terminate the action. (Baker v. Curtis, sp. t., 7 How. 478.) But, if tile plaintiff desires it, he is always allowed to serve his complaint within a limited time, upon payment of costs, and if lie should establish a sufficient excuse, the permission would probably be granted without costs. The order may be in the following form:,217. Order dismissing com)27plint. [Title of catsse.] [ Caption.

ART 1.-What is a failure to answer. It was at first held that the defendant might answer at any time before judgment was entered, although the time within which an answer is required to be served, had expired. (Foster v. Udell, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 30; and see Carpenter v. N. Y. & New Haven R. R. Co., sp. t., 11 How. 483.),But this doctrine has been thoroughly overruled, and on the expiration of the time for answering, the plaintiff, it is well settled, may proceed to judgment at his leisure, and the defendant cannot interpose an answer unless by leave of the court. (Mandeville v. WVinwe, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 162; 5 How. 461; d. Gown v. Leavenworth, 2 E. D. Smith, 24; Dudley v.

(Ib.) But judgment must not be entered until the defendant has had an opportunity to correct the error. (Laimbeer v. Allen, sp. t., 2 Sands. 648; 2 Code Rep. 15.) An answer cannot, however, be treated as a nullity, on the ground that it is frivolous or slhiam. Application must be made to the court in such cases. (Strout v. Cur- ran, sp. t., 7 How. 36.),ART. 2.-Proceedings on default of some, only, of the,defendants. If any one of defendants severally liable, fail to answer, judgment may be taken against him. (Code, Â§ 136.),But if the defendants are only jointly liable, judgment cannot be entered against one, until the claim against all of them is decided (Sluyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673; Catlin v. Latson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 218; 13 How. 511; affirmed at genl. t., see 16 N. Y. 622; Bacon v. Comstock, sp. t., 11 How. 197; see Jagues v. Greenwood, sp. t., 1 Abb. 230; Ford v. David, 1 Bosw. 570); though a joint answer can- not be served after the time of any one of the defendants has expired (Jaques v. Greenwood, supra); and judgment must be rendered at the trial against the defendant in default, even though his co-defendants succeed in their defense. (See Sluyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673.) Defendants who are jointly and severally liable, may be treated as if severally liable. (Stannard v. Mattice, sp. t., 7 How. 4.) ART. 3.-Obtaining judgment in actions for debt, after,personal service of summons. In action upon contract for the recovery of money only, where the summons has been served on the defend- ant personally, judgment may be recovered, after his,251
Obtaining judgment in actions for debt. failure to answer, upon application to the clerk of the court. (Code, Â§ 246.) In the Supreme Court, the clerk of the county specified in the complaint, or summons, is, of course the proper clerk to enter judgment.,We have already reviewed, the conflicting decisions upon the meaning of a similar clause in Â§ 129 of the Code, and have arrived at the conclusion that it refers to actions upon contracts which by their terms require the payment of money only. (Ante, i. 356.) We think this class of actions may be comprehended under the generic title of actions for debt, as distinguished from actions for dam- ages, for special relief, or for specific property. The test which will distinguish an action for debt from one for damages, is the question whether an answer disputing the amount due, without denying that something was due, would be good, or if (as in an action for a penalty), the complaint does not put the amount in an issuable form, whether an excessive demand of judgment could be cor- rected by motion. If either question is answered affirm- atively, the action is one of debt, and not of damages, and application for judgment, in case of failure to answer, should be made to the clerk. Thus, in an action upon a note, the amount of the note would be issuable; and so would the value of goods sold, where the complaint alleges them to be worth so much (see Gregory v. Wright, sp. t., 11 Abb. 417); because if the note was blank, or the goods were utterly worthless, there would be no cause of action, and a partial defense may and must be pleaded (APKyrilng v. Btul, 16 N. Y. 29 ); but in an action for converting or injuring property, the value of the pro- perty is not issuable (see ante, p. 23). If, therefore, the defendant in an action for debt has any possible ground for mitigation of damages, he can avail himself of it by pleading, which, in an action for damages, whether inde- pendent of contract or not, he is not at liberty to do, unless he also controverts some other part of the com- plaint. 252
Obtaining judgment in actions for debt. It would plainly be very unjust to permit a plaintiff, upon his own unsupported estimate of his damages, to take judgment in every case where the defendant does not fedl at liberty to deny the act complained of, without submitting the amonnt of damages to an impar- tial scrutiny; but where the defendant has abundant opportunity, consistently with the truth, to protect him- self by pleading, there is no reason why he should not do so. And it is upon these considerations, rather than on the strict letter of the statute, that the courts have acted. Proceedings when complaint 7W3 been verifie(d.]-If the complaint has been sworn to, the plaintiff can obtain judgment for the amount demanded in the summons (with which the complaint must agree; see ante, p. 81,) on filing with the clerk proof of personal service of the summons and complaint, or summons alone, on the defendant against whom judgment is demanded, and of the fact that no answer has been received. (Code, 246.) The proper proof of these facts is a sheriff's certificate of service, the defendant's admission, or an affidavit of service by the person who made it and of the non-receipt of an answer, by the person who subscribed the summons or his managing clerk. For form of affidavit of service, see Â§ 25, ante, i. 385. The affidavit that no answer has been received need not allege that no demurrer has been received, as the one is included in the other. (Brodhead v.'Brodhead, sp. t., 4 How. 309.) It must show that no answer has been received within twenty days after the service of the sum- mons. The case of Brien v. Casey, (sp. t., 2 Abb. 416), is not a sufficient authority for holding that the affidavit must show that no answer had been received up to the time of applying for judgment. Such a ruling would be directly contrary to the well settled practice of the court,,253
Proceedings when complaint has been verified. under which an answer served after its time, though before application for judgment, is ineffectual. (See M'Gown v. Leavenworth, 2 E. D. Smith, 31.) The affidavit should not however be stale. One made five years before was held insufficient. (Brien v. Casey, sp. t., 2 Abb. 416.) If it is necessary in any case to state that no notice of appearance had been received, it certainly is not upon an application to the clerk on a verified complaint.,The entry of judgment without any affidavit of no answer being received, is not a ground for appeal to the Court of Appeals. (Catlin v. Billings, 16 N. Y. 622.) It is a question of practice, on which the decision of the general term is conclusive. (Ib.) Of course the want of such an affidavit would make the judgment irregular, and it would be set aside on motion, except where the defend- ants are jointly liable, in which case it is not necessary. (See Catlin v. Latson & Billings, sp. t., 4 Abb. 248; 13 How. 511.),The following form may be used:,Â§ 218. Affidavit of failure to answer. [Title of cause.],COUNTY OF ............: A. B., of said county, being duly sworn, says:,1. That he is the [managing clerk of ...........,the] attorney whose name is subscribed to the summons herein.,2. That no answer has been received by the said attorney from the defendant [naming him, if the judgment is taken against one of several defendants.],[Jurat.] [Signature.] Upon filing the summons and complaint, with these affidavits, with the clerk, he must enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount demanded in the summons and complaint. (Code, Â§ 246.) No notice of this applica-; tion need be given to the defendant, even though he has appeared in the action. (Southworth v. Curtis, sp. t., 6 254
Affidavit of failure to answer. Notice of assessment by the clerk. How. 271; Dix v. Paltmer, sp. t., 5 How. 233; see Cook v. poneroy, sp. t., 10 How. 108.) But notice must be given of the adjustment of costs, if the defendant has appeared. (Dix v. Palmer, sp. t., 5 How. 233; Elson v. N. Y. Equitable Ins. Co., 2 Code Rep. 30; 2 Sands. 741.) Proceedings when complaint is not serfief.]-If the com- plaint is not verified, the clerk must assess the amount due to the plaintiff if the action is brought upon an instrument for the payment of money only, by an exami- nation of the instrument itself, and in other cases by examining the plaintiff under oath, or upon other proof, and must enter judgment for the amount found by him to be due. (Code, Â§ 246.) In case the defendant has given notice of appearance in the action, he must have five days' notice of the time and place of this assessment (Code, Â§ 246), and if the judgment is entered without such notice, it will be set aside. (Cook v. Pomneroy, sp. t., 10 How. 108; King v. Stafford, sp. t., 5 How. 34; see Kelsey v. Covert, sp. t., 6 Abb. 336 n.; 15 How. 92.) A notice of appearance, served after the time for answering has expired, entitles the defendant to notice of assessment, unless the assess- ment has already been made. (See Carpenter v. New Haven B. B. Co., sp. t., 11 How. 483; Abbott v. Smith, sp. t., 8 How. 463; overruling WWhite v. Feat7erstonlhatigh, sp. t., 7 How. 358; Lynde v. West, 12 Wend. 235; see Cook v. Pomeroy, sp. t., 10 How. 108.) As to what constitutes an appearance, see ante, i. 390.,Â§ 219. Notice of assessment by the clerk.

(See Code, Â§ 139.),The clerk is not obliged to file any report of his assess. ment with the judgment (Ameriean .Exchange Bank v, Smith, 6 Abb. 1; overruling Squire v. Ellsworth, sp. t., 4 How. 77), but we think it is better practice to do so, or, at any rate, to file some statement of the manner in whicli the amount due was ascertained. ART. 4.-Obtaining judgment in actions for damages, or,for specific property. Aplplication, where made.]-In all actions other than for debt, the plaintiff must apply to the court for judgment upon the defendant's failure to answer. (Code, Â§ 246.),This application must be made at a special term, or circuit court (Rule 24, Supreme Ct.), and cannot be heard at chambers (Aymar v. Chace, 12 Barb. 301), nor at a general term (Ryan v. IM'Cainell, 1 Sands. 709; 1 Code Rep. 93); but as the judges in New York city hold a special term in chambers every day, the application may be made at chambers in that city. (Porter v. Lent, 2 Abb. 116; 4 Duer, 671; see ante, i. 119, 226.),If the application is made at a special term, it may be made in any county within the judicial district in which the trial county is situated, or in a county adjoining the trial county (Rule 24, Supreme Ct.), unless the trial county is New York. (Code, Â§ 401.) If made at a circuit court it must be made in the trial county. (Rule 24, Suprene Ct.),The trial county is, of course, the county specified in the complaint. 256
In actions for damages, &o. Notice. Proof of service. Other proof. Notice.]--If the defendant gives notice of appearance in the action before the expiration of the time for answer- ing, he is entitled'to eight days' notice of the time and place of application to the court for judgment. (Code, Â§ 246.) A judgment taken without notice in such case is irregular, and will be set aside. (Kelsey v. Covert, sp. t., 6 Abb. 336 it.; 15 How. 92; Saltus v. Kipp, sp. t., 2 Abb. 382; 12 How. 342; 5 Duer, 646; King v. Stafford, sp. t., 5 How. 30.) The service of any paper in the action, signed by the defendant or his attorneys, unless restricted specifically to a particular purpose, is an appearance. (See anie, i. 390.) The notice may be in the following form:,Â§ 220. Notice of application to the courtforjudgment. [Me of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the plaintiff will apply to the court, at [ic.] on [&c.] for the relief demanded in the complaint. [Date.] [Signature.] [Address.] Proof of service and failute to answer.]-The service of the summons and failure to answer must be proved in the same manner as before the clerk. (See ante, p. 253.) Other proof.]-The Code (5 246, subd. 2) allows the plaintiff to apply for judgment upon the like proof to that required upon application to the clerk. The effect of this clause is, we think, to require the plaintiff to prove his claim when the complain'. is unverified, and to leave 1 to the discretion of the court to decide whether he shall be called upon for evidence or not, when the complaint is verified. This seems to us a fair construction of the Code, and supported, though not expressly decided, by the cases. (See Depew v. Leal sp. t., 2 Abb. 138 a.; Hurd v. Leaven- trth, sp. t., Code Rep. i. S. 279.) The courts never allow judgments to be taken against infdnts without proof. (Aldrich v. Laphanm, sp. t., 6 How.,33.,257
In actions for damages, &c. Assessment of damage 129; Litchfleld v. Burwell, sp. t., 5 How. 341; Cost v. Rose 17 ll. 275; see James v. James, 4 Paige, 119.),Assessment of damages.]-In actions for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages for its detention, the court may order the dama. ges to be assessed by a jury, or, if the examination of a long account is involved, by a reference. (Code, Â§ 246.) And no judgment can be rendered in such actions (except, we presume, for nominal damages), without an assessment (Reformed Dutch Church v. Wood, 8 Barb. 421), nor can a reference be ordered in such cases, unless the examination of a long account is involved (Hor v. Doody, 2 Abb. 92; 4 Duer, 670; Heieitt v. Howell, sp. t., 8 How. 346; Boyce v. Comstock, sp. t., Code Rep. N. 8. 290), but the court may, if it will, assess the damages itself, without the aid of a jury or referee. (Del)pez v. Leal, sp. t., 2 Abb. 138 n.; Gale v. Rubbins, sp. t., ib.),It seems, that in an action for specific property, if the plaintiff will waive his claim for damages for the deten- tion, he may take judgment without any assessment (Horn v. Doody, 2 Abb. 92; 4 Duer, 670); but this can- not be allowed in an action for chattels, unless the plaintif has obtained possession of the goods, for otherwise the judgment must be in the alternative, for their return or their value, if they cannot be had (Code, Â§ 277), and the value must therefore be assessed, as it is not the subject of an issue. (Connoss v. 1Ueir, 2 E. D. Smith, 314; McKelsie v. Farrell, 4 Bosw. 202.),The assessment is usually directed to be made by a sheriff's jury (Horn v. Doody, 2 Abb. 92; 4 Duer, 670; Rickards v. Swetzer, sp. t., 3 How. 413; 1 Code Rep. 117; see Carman v. Bryant, sp. t., 6 Duer, 668; Stanley v. Anderson, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 52); but the court may, in its discretion, order an assessment at the circuit or trial term (Dillaye v. Hart, sp. t., 8 Abb. 394; MiCollum v: Barker, 3 Johns. 153; see Cazneau v. Bryant, sp. t., 6 258
In ctious for damages, &e. Assessmeut of damages. laer, 668); and it seems that the court will permit the ltter course to be adopted, when difficult questions of law are likely to arise upon the assessment (Dillaye v. lMart; Cazneau v. Bryant, supra), or when the case has enlisted public feeling to an extent that makes it necessary for the protection of the parties' rights, that they should be allowed to challenge jurors. (Dillaye v. Hart, supra.) If the sheriff of the trial county is interested, or in any way disqualiied to act, the assessment should be made by a coroner. The fact that the defendant's attorneys are the sheriff's toansel, is not regarded as a sufficient reason for direct- ing an inquest to be had before the court. (Hays v. Berrynian, sp. t., 6 Bosw. 679.) In what county.]-The assessment must be made in the trial county, unless made by the court at the time of granting judgment, or unless otherwise ordered by the eourt (BUde 24, Supreme Ct.) Order for assessment by jury.]-The form of the order for assessment is not settled by any authorities, and the practice is various, some judges ordering a writ of inquiry to issue, while others order an assessment without any such formality. In our opinion, the writ of inquiry is superfluous, as the order is sufficient authority for the serifs to summon a jury, and when filed as part of the judgment roll, it will fully support the judgment. More- over, the Code (Â§ 246) directs that the court may order an wssment by jury, and says nothing about ordering a nit We give, however, forms adapted to both methods of procedure.,( 22L Order for a skeriff's jury to assess damages.

I8... 3. That the said judge return the inquisition hereupon to the clerk of the county of ....... duly certified by him, within ..... days from the date hereof. The order may in this case also provide for the issuing of a writ of inquiry, but we regard such a proceeding as so entirely superfluous, that we give no forms for the purpose. The judge, in executing this order, does not act as an assistant to the sheriff, but in his own judicial capacity (Ellsworth v. Thompson, 13 Wend. 658); and we have therefore modified the order according to our views of the course to be pursued upon the inquisition, as to which, see post. A copy of this order should be served on the defendant, if he has appeared; and a certified copy upon the judge holding the circuit or trial term, at the commencement of the same. Diligence in proceeding.]--The plaintiff must proceed with reasonable diligence in the execution of the writ or wder. And if he is dilatory in so doing, the defendant may obtain an order requiring him to execute the writ within a specified time, and dismissing the complaint in case of failure to do so. (Kent v. llDonald, 15 Johns. 400.),261
In actions for damages, &c. Notice of inquiry. Notice of inquiry.]-If the defendant has appeared in the action, he must have notice of the time and place of the inquisition (see Code, Â§ 414); which will be fixed by the sheriff on application.,The same notice must be given as in cases of trial, viz., fourteen days. (Code, Â§ 256.) The form of the notice under the old practice was peculiar, stating a time between two certain hours, as "between thL hours of 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon" (Arnold v. Squire, Sayer, 181); and a notice that the writ would be executed "by ten o'clock" (Ison v. Sooen, 2 Str. 1142), or "at 10 o'clock, or as soon thereafter as the sheriff can attend" (Hanna- ford v. Holman, Barnes, 295), or, "between 10 and 2 o'clock" (Foster v. Smnales, Barnes, 295), was held bad for uncertainty. But a notice specifying a precise hour, as "at 11 o'clock," was good. (Last v. Denny, Barnes, 302.),But if the damages are to be assessed at the circuit or trial term, the notice is not subject to these rules, and may be in the common form of a notice of trial, and the judge will appoint a day and hour. (1 Tidd's Pr. 579; 1 Sellon, 353.) In such case the notice must of course be served fourteen days before the commencement of the term.,B 225. Notice of inquijr before the sheriff.

Mistakes in the notice will not vitiate it, unless the defendant is actually misled thereby. Thus, a notice for "Wednesday, the 11th of June," when Wednesday fell on the 10th, was held good, the writ being executed on the Wednesday (Eldon v. Haig, 1 Chitt. Rep. 11); and so was a notice given for " Tuesday the 14th," though the 14th fell on Thursday, on which day the writ was executed (Batten v. Harrison, 3 Bos. & Pul. 1); the defendant fail- ing to swear in either case that he was misled by the error. . Countermand of notice.]-If necessary, the notice may be countermanded, by service of a notice of countermand at least six days before the day appointed. (1 Burr. Pr. 376; Grah. Pr. 797.) Such at least was the former rule, and we presume it is valid now. The notice of countermand may be as follows:,Â§ 227. Countermand of notice of inquiry.

-- In actions for damages, &o. Proceedings before sheriff's jury. Preparations for the inquest.]-Witnesses may be sub. penaed or their testimony otherwise procured in the same manner as in case of a trial. The form of a subpoena is the same as that used upon ordinary trials (see post, chap. xci.), except that it requires the witness to appear " before the sheriff or undersheriff of the county of.......,, (See ante, pp. 258, 259.),A blank form of inquisition should be left with the sheriff at least one day before it is to be executed, in. dorsed with a memorandum of that day. (1 Burr. Pr. 377.),This inquisition may be in the following form:,Â§ 228. Inquisition on a writ of inquiry &r order for assessment. [Title of cause.],CourrY OF ............: An inquisition, taken on the ...... day of .........., in the year eighteen hundred and .......... at the ............., in the .............. of............... before me, ............, sheriff of said county, by virtue of a writ of inquiry [or, an order to assess damages] to me directed, to inquire of certain matters by the oaths of [naming the jurors], twelve good and lawful men of the said county, who, being sworn, say that the plaintiff has sustained damages to the amount of.... .... dollars, by reason of the matters mentioned in the said writ [or, order] [or, that the value of the property mentioned in the said ........ is........ dollars].,IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, the said sheriff, and we, the said jurors have set our hands and seals, the day above written.,[Signatures and seals.] Course of proceeding before sheriff's jury.]-The proceed- ings before the sheriff are regulated by the former prac tice. (Saltus v. Kipp, 2 Abb. 382; 5 Duer, 646; 12 How. 342.) The sheriff, undersheriff, or deputy, may conduct the inquest. (Tillotson v. Cheethatm, 2 Johns. 63, 72.) The inquest is conducted in substantially the same manner as a trial in court, though with less formality. (1 Burr. Pr. 377.) It must be held at the time and place specified in 264
In actions for damages, &o. Proceedings before sheriff's Jury. the notice, even though the defendant fail to attend; and if not so held, it will be set aside on moton (see Jones v. Chune, 1 Bos. & Pul. 364), but the sheriff is not bound to execute it within the precise hours mentioned in the notice, and the defendant must wait, if necessary, after those hours have expired. (Williams v. F tith, 1 Doug. 198.) The jurors cannot Le challenged, in the full meaning of the term (Anon., 3 Salk. 81; see Dillame v. Hart, sp. t., 8 Abb. 394; Tillotson v. Cweetluam, 2 Johns. 71), but if valid objections are made to any of them, the sheriff ought to set such aside, and summon new jurors in their places (see Butler v. Kelsey, 15 Johns. 1.79); and if noto- riously unfit persons are put on the jury, the court will set aside the inquisition. (Stainton v. Beadle, 4 T. R. 473.) Objections to any of the jury must be made openly, and if the sheriff, at the private request of one of the parties, remove a juror, the inquisition wi1 be set aside. (Butler v. Kelsey, 15 Johns. 177.) The sheriff is not obliged to select jurors from the list prepared by the commissioner of jurors, in counties where such an office exists. (Jen- nings v. Asten, 5 Duer, 695.) The rules of evidence are the same as upon an ordinary trial, except that, the cause of action being admitted by the default (Green v. Hearne, 3 T. R. 301; Thellusson v. Fletcher, 1 Doug. 315; East India Co. v. Glover, 1 Str. 612); no evidence need be given by the plaintiff to estab- lish it (Green v. Hearne, supra; Livingston v. Douglas, 2 Dowl. P. C. 630 n.), and none can be allowed on behalf of the defendant to disprove it (Foster v. Smith, 10 Wend. 377; Stevens v. Pell, 2 Cromp. & Mees. 710; East India Co. v. Glover, 1 Str. 612; Do Gaillon v. L'Aigle, 1 Bos. & Pul. 368); the only question for the consideration of the jury being the amount of damages. (Foster v. Smith, supra; De GCiliot v. L'Aigie, supra.) Therefore in an ation for breach of contract, evidence that the contract was not made, or was void (De Gaillon v. L'Aigle, 1 Bos.,34,265
In actions for damages, &c. Proceedings before sheriff's jury. & Pul. 368; East India Co. v. Glover, 1 Str. 612), or evi- dence of a set-off that might have been pleaded (see Caruthers v. Graham, 14 East 578), or, in an action fora wrong, evidence that the act was lawful (Foster v. Smith, 10 Wend. 377), is inadmissible, although offered under color of mitigating the damages.,It is proper to read the complaint to the jury as evi- dence of the main facts alleged therein, though not as any evidence of the amount of damage sustained, that not being admitted by the default. (Jennings v. Asten, 5 Duer, 695.),The plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages, in every case, although he produce no evidence (Jacklson v. Rath- bone, 3 Cow. 296; Mlarshall v. Griffin, Ry. & Moo. N. P. 41); and a verdict for the defendant would, under any circumstances, be set aside on motion. (Jackson v. Iath- bone, supra.),It has been held that in an action for a wrong, the plaintiff cannot recover more than nominal damages un- less he proves the commission of the wrongful act by the defendant (Bates v. Loomis, 5 Wend. 134); but the rea- soning of the court in that case is extremely vague, and the very reverse has been decided in England. (Trpp v. Thomas, 3 Barn. & Ores. 427.) The opinion in Bates v. loomis is perhaps law as far as regards actions for assault and battery, but cannot control other actions.,Adjournment.]-The inquest may be adjourned, if ne- cessary (see Butler v. Kelsey, 15 Johns. 179), and should be, when prolonged to a late hour on Saturday night, as the inquisition will not be good, if taken on Sunday. (Ib.),Inquisition and return.]-The jury must deliberate and agree upon their verdict immediately after the case has been submitted to them (Van Waggenen v. M'Donald, 3 Wend. 478); and it is irregular for them to hear several causes before deciding any. (Ib.) But an error in this respect is not a ground for appeal, but only for a motion 266
In actions for damages, &c. Proceedings on reference or at circuit. to set aside the inquisition; and if both parties consented to a different course, neither can afterwards object thereto. (lb.) . It is usually said, in books of practice, that the inquisi- tion should be signed and sealed by the sheriff and jurors, but it seems that their seals are not necessary. (See note to Scott v. Bushman, 1 Cow. 212.) The blank form of inquisition (Â§ 228, ante, p. 264,) should be filled up, and the sheriff should then indorse his return on the writ or order, which may be in any form, as for example, "sExecuted, as per inquisition herewith. A. B., sheriff." Proceedings on reference.]-See post, chap. xcvi. The proceedings are the same as upon an ordinary trial by referees, subject to the same rules of evidence as hereto- fore mentioned, ante, p. 265. The referee must make his report of the amount due to the plaintiff, which must be filed with the clerk, in the same manner, and with like effect, as the sheriff's inquisition and return. Course of proceeding at the circuit.].-When the inquisi tion is executed at the circuit or trial term, the proceed- ings are in all respects similar to those upon an ordinary inquest, so far as concerns the empaneling of the jury and assessment of damages. (Ellsior;th v. Thompson, 13 Wend. 662.) For the manner of conducting an inquest, see ante, p. 264. The same rules as to the character of the evidence which may be received, apply to an inquisition taken before a judge, as have been already mentioned in regard to the corresponding proceeding before a sheriff. The result of the inquisition should be certified by the judge presiding at it (Ellsworth v. Thompson, 13 Wend. 058); and we believe it is not necessary that the jurors should sign it. Setting aside the inquest.]-Either party may move to set aside the inquest, on grounds similar to. those upon which a verdict would be set aside. (1 Burr. Pr. 379.),267
Inactions for damages, &o Setting aside inquest For an analysis of these grounds of motion, see post, chap. xcvii. And this is the only remedy which can be had against errors which do not appear on the record, where judgment is thus taken. (Van Waggen v. M'Don aid, 3 Wend. 478.),Thus, if the assessment is taken, in the absence of the defendant, at a time or place different from that specified in the notice, it will be set aside' on motion (see Jones v. Chune, 1 Bos. & Pul. 364); and so, if notoriously unfit persons are placed on the jury (Stainton v. Beadle, 4 T. R. 473), or if improper persons are retained upon the jury after due objection made to them (see Butler v. Kelsey, 15 Johns. 177), or if a juror is stricken off at the private request of a party (ib.), or if the inquisition is made on Sunday (ib.), or if the sheriff's jury hear more causes than one before assessing the damages of any. (See Van Waggenen v. M'Donald, 3 Wend. 478.),The inquest should be set aside where improper evi- dence has been admitted, as for instance, where the de- fendant has been allowed to disprove the cause of action (De Gaillon v. L'Aigle, 1 Bos. & Pul. 368), or to justify the wrongful act on which the action is brought (Foster v. Smith, 10 Wend. 377); but if it appears probable that such evidence has not affected the award of the jury, the court will not interfere. (Ward v. Haight, 3 Johns. Cas. 80.),The inquest will also be set aside where the jury has mistaken the law, to the prejudice of either party (Neale v. Wyllie, 3 Barn. & Ores. 533; Markiamm v. Middeton, 2 Str. 1259; Woodford v. Eades, 1 Str. 425), or for a misdi- rection by the sheriff or judge (Brookes v. Beberd, 8 Dowl. & Ryl. 69; see DeGaillon v. L'Aigle, 1 Bos. & Pul. 368), or where there has been a clear mistake of fact. (Mechan- ics' Bank v. Mintlwrne, 19 Johns. 244.),A verdict for the defendant would in any case be set aside. (Jackson v. Rathbone, 3 Cow. 296.),The proceedings upon this motion are so exactly analo- gous to those taken upon a motion to set aside a verdict, 268
In actions for damagns, &c. In actions for special relief. that we refer generally to that subject, as treated post, chap. xcvii. Where the motion is founded upon an alleged insufficiency of testimony to justify the verdict, it should be accompanied with affidavits, or a copy of the sheriff's notes, showing what testimony was given. (See Jennings v. Asten, 5 Duer, 695.) If the motion is made after judgment is entered, the notice of motion should demand the setting aside of the judgment as well as the inquest. If otherwise, the inquest only should be men- tioned. ART. 5.-Obtaining judgment in actions for special relief. Application, where miade.]-As before stated, the plain- tiff must, in all actions other than for debt, apply to the court, at a special term within the judicial district within which the trial county is located, or in a county adjoining that county; or at a circuit court held in the trial county, for judgment on failure to answer. (Ante, p. 256.) If New York is the county named for trial, the application must be made within that county, but may be made at chambers, as a special term is always held there. (lb.) Notice.]-The same notice must be given of the appli- cation for judgment, as is required in actions for damages. (See ante, p. 257.) Proof of default.]-The service of the summons and failure to answer must be proved in the same manner as on application to the clerk. (See ante, p. 253.) Further proceedings.]-In actions for special relief, the court may take any account or hear the proof of any fact necessary to enable it to give judgment, or it may, in its own discretion, order a reference for that purpose. (Code, g 246.) In this class of actions, it is not at all a matter of course to render the judgment demanded on a mere fail- ure to answer (Simneonds v. Pallas, 8 Irish Eq. 335; Lloyd,269
In actions for special relief. 'Whire summons served by publicatikn v. Lloyd, 4 Dru. & War. 372); for the court will some. times require proof of the plaintiff's case (Lloyd v. Lloyd, 4 Dru. & War. 372; Hayes v. Brierley, 3 id. 274; see Didier v. Warner, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 42); and in every case, the complaint must show some cause of action, or it will be dismissed. (Siminondls v. Pallas, 8 Irish Eq. 340; 3MolesworIth v. ferney, Dick. 667; Speidall v. Jert is, id. 632.),Nor is it enough that a good cause of action is estab. lished; but the facts of the case must justify the particular kind of relief demanded, as none can be granted that is not specified in the complaint (Code, Â§ 275); and it would be irregular to grant relief not authorized by the facts.,As the costs in these actions are entirely in the discre. tion of the court (Code, Â§ 306); the plaintiff must take care that they are specially granted by the court, or he can enter none in the judgment.,If damages, as well as other relief, are demanded, the court may assess them itself, or order them to be assessed by a jury, in the same manner as in actions for damages alone (see ante, p. 258), or it may order a reference, whether an account is involved or not. (Code, Â§ 246.),The plaintiff may either prepare the judgment to which he thinks himself entitled, and submit it to the court, or he may obtain an order for the entry of judgment in a particular form. If he adopts the former course, he should get the judge to indorse the judgment with a brief direction to the clerk to enter it with costs to be taxed; if lie prefers the latter course, the order will contain the substance of the judgment, without the statement of jurisdictional facts, and including a similar direction. ART. 5.-Obtaining judgment in actions in whinch the sutm,monls was served by publication. In actions of every description, in which the summons has been served by publication, the application for judg- ment must be made to the court (Code, Â§ 246; Hallett v. 270
Where summons served by publication. Proof of service. Righter, sp. t., 13 How. 46), at a special term or circuit, as in actions for damages, and subject to the same rules, as to which see ante, p. 256. Notice.]-The application must be made on eight days' notice to the defendant, if he appeared before the expira- tion of the time for answering (Code, Â§ 246), and if notice is not given in such cases, the judgment will be irregular. (See ante, p. 257.) And even where the defendant appears after the time for answering has expired, it is better to give him notice of the application, unless there is some good reason for not doing so; for the judgment will doubtless be granted on easier terms when the defendant appears, than when he does not. Proof of service.]-The plaintiff must prove the service of the summons by producing a certified copy or original of the order for publication, the affidavits on which it was founded, the affidavit of the printer of the newspaper in ,which the summons was published, or of his foreman or principal clerk, showing that it was published in con- formity to the order, an affidavit of the mailing of a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant, or of the personal service of the same upon him, and an affidavit or certificate of the filing of the complaint before publica- cation. (See ante, i. 370, 383; Hallett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 43.) The form given ante, i. 386, is sufficient, with the cor- rection pointed out in the errata of that volume (p. miii.), but not otherwise. The form of an affidavit of mailing, given ante, i. 386, 28, is sufficient. So is the form of affidavit under the law of 1853. (lb. Â§ 29.),271

B., being duly sworn, says, that on the .... day of ............, 18.., he filed the complaint in this action with the clerk of the county of .............,[Jurat.] [Signature.] A simple certificate of the clerk, to the same effect, will answer the same purpose.,Other proof.]-The plaintiff must, in all cases where the summons was served by publication, prove to the satisfac tion of the court the truth of his complaint (Code, Â§ 246); and if the defendant is not a resident of the state, the court must require the plaintiff or his agent to be exam- ined on oath respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintiff, or to any one for his use, on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover. (Ib.),In actions for money only, the plaintiff must also show by affidavit that an attachment has been issued in the action, and levied upon property belonging to the defend- ant, specifically describing the same, and stating its value. (Rule 25, Supreme Ct.),This affidavit may be in the following form:,230. Affidavit of the issuance of an attachment. [Title of cause.],COUNTY OF ............: A. B., being duly sworn, says: 1. That he is the plaintiff [or, plaintiff's attorney, or, managing clerk to the plaintiff's attorney] in this action.,2.

Where summons was served by publication. Security before judgment Reference.]-T-here does not seem to be .ny authority, either in Â§ 246 or Â§ 271 of the Code, for a reference to ascertain the truth of the complaint (see Chaalmain v. Lemon, sp. t., 11 How. 239); but the court may certainly order a reference for the purpose of examining the plain- tiff concerning, payments on account, as this is taking an account before judgment. (Code, Â§ 271.) It is not desirable that a reference should be ordered if it can be avoided, as it causes, almost inevitably, both delay and expense. Security beforejudgment.]-The court may, before ren- dering judgment, in all cases where the summons has been served by publication, require the plaintiff to file atisfactory security to abide the order of the court touch- ing the restitution of any property directed to be trans- ferred or delivered by, or of any money collected under, he judgment, in case the defendant or his representatives shall be admitted to defend the action, and succeed therein. (Code, Â§ 246.) And by rule 25 of the Supreme Court, the filing of such security is imperatively required before judgment in every action brought for the recovery of money only. (Ante, i. 184) The omission, therefore, to require such security in such actions, would render the judgment irregular, though not void. But in all other actions, such require- ment is in the discretion of the judge who renders the judgment. The form of security to be given will depend so much upon the discretion of the court, that we give no prece- dent. A simple undertaking will be sufficient, unless a bond is required by the court.,35 JUDGMENT ON FAILURE TO ANSWER.,273
Where only partial oounterclaim is pleaded. Notice.,CHAPTER LXX. JUDGIENT ON PARTIAL FAILURE TO ANSWER. In actions on contract for the recovery of money only, which, as before explained, are actions for debt as distin. guished from damages (see ante, p. 252), if the defendant by his answer does not' deny the plaintiff's claim, but sets up a counterclaim, amounting to less than the plain- tiff's claim, the plaintiff may apply to the clerk for judg- ment for the excess of his claim over the defendant's claim, and will be entitled to such judgment, filing with the clerk a statement admitting such counterclaim. (Code, Â§ 246.),It is not quite clear whether the defendant is entitled to notice of this application or not. By answering, he admits the truth of all of the complaint which he does not expressly deny, and therefore, even though the com- plaint be unverified, there seems to be no necessity for any assessment by the clerk, and if this be so, no notice is required. We think, on the whole, that no notice is necessary in any case where this application is made.,Notice should of course be given of the taxation of costs.,The statement admitting the counterclaim need not be in any particular form. The following example will be sufficient.,231. Statement admitting counterclaim. [Title of CJause.],The counterclaim set up in the defendant's answer herein, is hereby admitted.,A.

In what cases. Proceedings on application.,CHAPTER LXXL JUDGMENT O0 .AFLDURE TO REPLY. ARTICLB 1. In what cases judgment may be had.,2. Proceedings upon the application. ART. 1.-Int what cases judgment uzay be had. The Code (Â§ 154*) provides that "if the answer con- tain a statement of new matter constituting a counter- claim, and the plaintiff fail to reply or demur thereto within the time prescribed by law," the defendant may apply for judgmnent.,Where, under the amendment of 1860, the court orders a reply to be made to new matter in the answer, not con- stituting a counterclaim, the same course may be adopted on a failure to reply. (Code, Â§ 153.),ART. 2.-Proceedings upon the application. The motion must be made upon a notice of at least ten days. (Code, Â§ 154.) In all other respects it may be made in substantially the same manner as a motion for judgment upon failure to answer. An affidavit that no reply has been received is evidently necessary, notwithstanding a remark of WIL- LUD, J. (Brown v. Spear, sp. t., 5 How. 147,), implying the contrary. *As amended, 1862. Until then this section was left unaltered by a plpable oversight of the legislature, though it had abolished the reply in ll caes unless a counterclaim were set up in the answer, and the result was that though the defendant was at perfect liberty to apply, the courts were bound to deny such a motion, unless the answer contained a counter- claim. (See Quin v. Chambers, 1 Duer, 673; Richtmyer v. askins, 9 How. 484; Afyatt v. Saratoga Mutual Ins. Co., sp. t, 9 How. 496; Wa- lu r. Upton, sp. t, 8 How. 205.),275
Proceedings on application. Notice of applioation.,Â§232. Notice of apllication for judgment. [itle of cause.],Please take notice, that on the pleadings and the annexed ass davit, the defendant will apply to the court, at [&c.] on [&c,] for judgment for want of a reply in this action, or for such other relief as may be just, with costs.,[Date and address.] [QSinature] The ordinary affidavit of service of the answer should be made by the person who made the service; and also an affidavit, by the attorney or his principal clerk, that no reply has been received. If the answer contained no counterclaim, a certified copy of the order requiring a reply, and an affidavit of service of such order, must also be presented to the court.,On these papers the motion may be heard, and if granted absolutely, judgment may be entered at once, But the order for judgment may be conditional, allowing the plaintiff a limited time to answer upon payment of costs.,And if the case requires it, a writ of inquiry may be issued to assess damages (Code, Â§ 154), or we presume, an order for assessment may be granted; the proceedings upon which will be similar to those upon the writ or order granted upon failure to answer. (See ante, p. 258.) 276

In what cases allowed.,2. At what stage of the action. 3. In whose favor. 4. Mode of application. 6. The order. 6. Subsequent proceedings. ART. 1.-In awlat cases allowed. Whenever several actions between the same parties, for causes of action which may be joined, are pending in the same court, that court may, in its discretion, if it appear expedient, order the several actions to be consoli- dated into one (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 666; [2 id. 383]); or if one or more of such actions are pending in the Supreme Court, and others in other courts, the former may order them all to be consolidated into one action in the Supreme Court. (Ib.) These provisions of the Revised Statutes were enacted, however, solely with reference to actions at law, and never applied to actions in equity, nor is there anything in the Code to extend their operation. It is on this ground, no doubt, that an unreported case (Grant v. Spencer, cited, Voorh. Code, 6th ed. 257) was decided, an application of this nature in foreclosure suits being denied. As the whole subject, within these limits, is left to the discretion of the court in each particular case, it is diffi- cult to state any reliable rules upon which the court may be expected to act. But, with this reservation, we pro- ceed to mention a few rules which may be deduced from reported cases.,277
In what cases allowed. Questions must be the sama The motion will not be granted unless it is plainly shown that the questions to be tried are the same in each action, the nature of the defenses, if any, being identical (Morris v. Knox, sp. t., 6 Abb. 328 n.; Crane v. oler, sp. t., ib.; Wilkinson v. Johnson, 4 Hill, 46; Dunn v. Ma. son, 7 Hill, 154); but it is not essential that the actions should be founded on the same transaction, provided the issues are identical. (See Wilkinson v. Johnson, 4 Hill, 46.) Nor is it a sufficient objection that the actions were commenced at different times (Dunning v. Bank of A.u bmrn, 19 Wend. 23; see Oldershawo v. Tregwell, 3 Carr. & P. 58), even though the cause of action in one suit had not accrued until after the other had been commenced. (lb.) But if the opposite pairty would be substantially delayed or prejudiced by consolidation, it should not be allowed. (Pierce v. Lyons, 3 Hill, 450; see Dunning v. Bank of Auburn, 19 Wend. 23.) In Pierce v. Lyons, supra, the motion was denied on the ground that there was no defense to one of the actions, and that the plain- tiff would have been, by consolidation, delayed in his reco- very until he had been through a trial upon the merits of another action. But as this delay could not now occur, the plaintiff being at liberty to move for the satisfaction of part of his claim, this case is not applicable under the Code. (See Morris v. Knox, sp. t., 6 Abb. 328 n.),If a consolidation of the actions would render the trial protracted or embarrassing, it will not be granted, but the proceedings may be stayed in all the actions except one. Thus, where sixty-four actions were commenced to re cover penalties accruing upon similar facts, occurring at different times, a consolidation was refused because of the embarrassment likely to ensue upon the trial, but two actions, representing the others under two distinct classes, were allowed to proceed, and the others stayed, with lib erty to either party to apply for further orders. (Clark v. Metropolitan Bank, 5 Sands. 665.),Actions upon wrongs, as well as upon contracts, may 278
In what cases allowed. At what time. In whose favor. be consolidated (Percy v. Seward, sp. t., 6 Abb. 326; Anon., 1 COitt. Rep. 709 a.), and the motion has been granted accordingly, in a libel suit. (Percy v. Sewtard, supra.) Actions may be consolidated on the application of the defendant, although he has no defense, in order to save him the costs of several judgments. (See Wilkinson v. Johlson, 4 Hill, 46; Brewster v. Stewart, 3 Wend. 441; Dunning v. Bank of Auburn, 19 Wend. 23.),ART. 2.-At what stage of the action. The statute places no restraint on the power of the court to grant the motion at any stage of the action, but it is advisable to move, if possible, before answering, as by so doing, the trouble of several answers will be saved. The court will undoubtedly look with distrust upon an application made after great delay, and if the causes are ready for trial, and any one of them is nearly reached upon the calendar, the motion would be denied, unless the delay was satisfactorily accounted for.,ART. 3.-In whose favor allowed. The motion may of course be made by the defendant, and generally proceeds from him, but it may also be made by the plaintiff (Briggs v. Gaunt, 2 Abb. 77; 4 Duer, 664), and may sometimes be desirable for him, as for example, where he sues upon several causes of action, and the de- fendant answers with a plea in avoidance of exactly the same nature, and founded upon the same facts, in all the actions,-a defense which the plaintiff may not always foresee.,ART. 4.-Mode of application. Application to adverseparty.]-In the first instance, an application should always be made to the opposite party for his consent, in order to save costs on the motion in case of his refusal. (See Dunning v. Bank of Auburn, 19 Wend. 23.) Where consolidation is sought by the. defendant, he should request the plaintiff's consent to enter an order for,279
Mode of application. Notice of motio. the purpose, without costs to either party. But whenthe plaintiff asks for a consolidation, he should offer to pay the costs in all the actions but one, down to the time of his application; because these terms will be imposed upon him when the motion is brought before the court (see Briggs v. Gaunt, 2 Abb. 77; 4 Duer, 664), and by consenting to them, he will save the-costs of the motion, which he would otherwise be required to pay, even though the motion were granted. (Ib.),Application to the court.]-If the adverse party refuses his consent on these terms, the application must be made to the court in the same manner as other motions.,If the actions are triable in different judicial districts, the motion may be made in any district within which any one of the actions is triable, or in a county adjoining the county in which one of them is triable. (Percy v. Seward, sp. t., 6 Abb. 326.),The notice of motion may be in the following form:,Â§ 233. Notice of motion for consolidation. SUPREME COURT.,JOHN SMITH,agt. JOIHN JONES.

When the motion is made by the plaintiff, the notice should not ask for costs.,Afidavite.]-The motion should be founded upon affi- davits, showing that the causes of action are such as may be joined, and either that no defense is intended, or that the intended defense is such that the issues to be tried in all the actions are the same. (Crane v. Kohler, sp. t., 6 Abb. 328 n.; Wilkinson v. Johnson, 4 Hill, 46; Dunning v. Bank of Auburn, 19 Wend. 23.) It is not enough to state that the defenses are substantially the same in all the actions (Crane v. Kohler, sp. t., 6 Abb. 328 n.: Dunn v. Mason, 7 Hill, 154); the nature of the defense intended must be set forth, in order that the court may judge whether the questions to be tried are identical. (Crane v. Kohler, supra.) No affidavit of merits is necessary. (Brewster v. Stewart, 3 Wend. 441.) The affidavit may be as follows:,Â§ 234. Affidavit on motion for consolidation. SUPREME COURT.

Its insertion in the affidavit will not avail anything, if the facts on which it depends are not stated, and inferences as a general rule are not proper materials for affidavits.,If the adverse party was previously requested to consolidate the actions, a copy of the request, with an admission or affidavit of service, or an affidavit of the circumstances, should be annexed to the preceding affi- davit.,ART. 5.-The order. As before observed, it is in the discretion of the court to grant or refuse the order. This discretion ought not to be used arbitrarily, but with due regard to justice, according to the circumstances of each case.,When granted, the order may be in the following form:,Â§ 235. 7The order of consolidation. [ rtles of all the causes.] [ Caltion.],On reading and filing [&c.], and on motion of [&c.] ORDERED, that the above entitled causes be consolidated into one action [in this court, with ........ dollars, costs of motion, to the defendant].,The words "in this court," are necessary only when some of the actions are, and some are not, in the Supreme Court. If the actions are triable in different counties, the order should specify the county in which the consolidated 282
The order of consolidation. Actions against different parties. action is to be tried, without prejudice to a subsequent motion to change the place of trial.,ART. 6.-Subsequent proceedings. After the service of the order, the actions are thereby united, the whole matter in dispute is litigated at one trial, and one judgment rendered for the amount found due to either party upon the whole case; and the judg- ment roll must contain the pleadings in all the actions. (Davis v. Smith, cited, Holm. & Dis. Pr. 275.) If any papers, relating to the consolidated action, are filed with the clerks of other counties than the one in which the action is to be tried, they should be transferred to the latter county; and it is the duty of the county clerks to make such transfer on being served with a certified copy of the order. If any such papers are filed with the clerks of other courts, when the actions are consolidated in the Supreme Court, an order for their transfer should be ob- tained from a judge of the court with which such papers are filed. If this could not be obtained, which is hardly supposable, a mandamus should be procured against the clerk of the court. No appeal can be taken from the decision of the court court upon the motion to consolidate, unless it exceeds its powers.,CHAPTER LXXIII. CONSOLIDATION OF ACTIONS AGAINST DIFFERENT PARTIES. Joint and several debtors.]-When several actions have been brought in the same court against joint and several debtors, the plaintiff may, in any stage of the proceed- ings, consolidate them into one action. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 666; [2 id. 383].) There is no authority for consolidating such actions at the instance of the defendants.,283
Joint and several debtors. Insurance pollcie The language of the statute seems to confer upon the plaintiff an absolute right to consolidate such actions without asking leave of the court, but it would uldoubt. edly be the safer plan to obtain an order for the purpose. The privilege thus conferred is, however, so rarely used that we shall not detail the practice.,In other cases.]-In England, marine insurances are effected by means of policies, each one of which is usually signed by more than one person, so as to divide the risk; the business of marine insurance being carried on exclu. sively, we believe, by individuals, members of " Lloyd's."' Each underwriter assumes a fixed amount of risk, and is in no sense a joint contractor with the others. Under these circumstances, almost every action, on a marine policy of any considerable amount, must be brought against several persons, although the questions of fact and law in each case are precisely alike. The English courts therefore, under the lead of Lord MAGFIEmD, adopted a rule, by which all of several actions on a marine policy, except one, were stayed until that one was decided, upon the defendants stipulating to abide by the event of that action. (1 Burr. Pr. 411.) This rule was fully adopted in this state (Clason v. Church, 1 Johns. Cas. 29), but the Supreme Court refused to extend it to cases where the actions were brought upon separate policies, although the risk and the issues were the same. (Camnman v. New York Ins. Co., 1 Caines, 114.),And as the English method of individual insurance is entirely obsolete in this state, and companies never, so far as we are aware, join in the execution of policies, this rule is practically obsolete also in courts. It is true that the rule was extended, at a later period, to the case of several actions for land, where the questions of fact and law were the same (Jackson v. Schazber, 4 Cow. 78); but in that case, it was left in the power of the adverse party, by an affidavit that different evidence would be produced 284

It appears to us, therefore, that there is scarcely any rnom for the further application of this rule, except by mutual consent, in the courts of this state, and this impression is confirmed by the fact that we find no report of its being attempted since the year 1825. Those who. are interested in the further study of the subject, will find it fully treated of in Burrill's Practice (vol. i. 411, 412).,TITLE V. CHAPTER LXXIV. SECURITY FOR COSTS. ART:CLE 1.

For a plaintiff not residing within the jurisdiction o' such court; or for several plaintiffs, who are all non-resi- dent; or, 2. For or in the name of the trustees of any debtor; or, 3. For or in the name of any person being insolvent, who has been discharged from his debts, or whose person has been exonerated from imprisonment pursuant to any,285

For or in the name of any person committed in exe- cution for a crime; or,,5. In the name of any infant whose next friend has not given security for costs (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620]); and until such security is filed, the plaintiff's attorney is liable for the costs to the extent mentioned in our next article. (Ib.) These provisions are not repealed by the Code. (Gardner v. Kelly, 2 Sands. 632.),Such security may also be required by the court: 1. When, after the commencement of a suit. all the plain- tiffs become non-residents, or are discharged in insolvency or exonerated as aforesaid, or are sentenced to state prison for any term less than life. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620].),2. In an action brought by an executor, administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly author- ized by statute. (Code, Â§ 317.),Foreign corporations must give such security before commencing suit. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 755; [2 id. 457]; see Code, Â§ 471.),A defendant cannot, upon taking an appeal from the judgment of the court, be compelled to give security under any of these provisions. He is not a plaintiff in any sense of the word. (Johnson v. Yeomans, sp. t., 8 How. 140.),Non-residenIs.]-Security can be required on the ground of non-residence only when all the plaintiffs are non-resi- dents. If one of the plaintiffs is a resident, no security can be required, even though he is irresponsible. (Ten Broeck v. Reynolds, sp. t., 13 How. 462.),For the rules by which the fact of residence is to be decided, see ante, i. 555.,A plaintiff who resided out of the jurisdiction of the court at the commencement of the action, cannot, by removing his residence to a place within the jurisdiction, 286
Non-residetnts. In what cases required. Infants. relieve himself from his obligation to file security for costs. (mbler v. Ambler, sp. t., 8 Abb. 340.) The New York Superior Court considers persons who, though residents of the state, do not reside in that city, as non-residents within the meaning of the statute, and requires them to file security for costs (Ashlbaihs v. Coussin, 2 Sands. 632; Blossom v. Adams, 2 Code Rep. 59); and though BOSWORTH, J., expressed an adverse opinion in a recent case, he did not feel at liberty to act upon his own conviction, and followed the preceding decisions. (Ilic7;s v. Payson, sp. t., 7 Abb. 326.) The New York Common Pleas, however, holds that its jurisdiction, within the intent of the statute, extends to the whole state, and that, consequently, no plaintiff resid- ing in the state can be required to file security for costs. (Robb v. Macdonald, 12 Abb. 213.) And the Superior Court of Buffalo takes the same view. (Montgolery v. Courter, sp. t., Clint. Dig. 748.) If the decisions of these latter courts are correct (as we think they are), the rule adopted in the New York Superior Court is erroneous, as the laws upon which these courts claim jurisdiction are similar to the law concerning the New York Superior Court. A foreign government, suing in a court of this state, is regarded in the same light as any non-resident person, and should give security for costs. (Republic of Mexico v. Arrangois, sp. t., 3 Abb. 470.) Infants.]-Security for costs on the ground of the plain- tiff's infancy can be required only when all the plaintiffs are infants, suing by guardians. (Hfulburt v. ]rewell, sp. t., 4 How. 93; 2 Code Rep. 54.) But where part of the plaintiffs are adults, and part infants, and the guardians of the latter are irresponsible, the court may require such guardians to file security or find responsible substitutes, and stay proceedings meanwhile. (Ten Broeoc& v. Howell, p. t., 13 How. 462.),287
In what cases required. Insolvents. Trustees, executors, &c. Insolvents.]-The fact that a plaintiff was discharged in insolvency is not of itself sufficient reason for requir. ing security for costs, when such discharge was made a long time (ten years) previously. He must also be shown to be insolvent at the commencement of the action. (Gomez v. Garr, 18 Wend. 577.),Trustees, executors, &c.]-The Superior Court of the city of New York has, in effect, completely nullified the clause of Â§ 317 of the Code which confers power on the court to require security for costs from executors, administrators and trustees. That court has decided that it will not re- quire such security unless it is probable that the plaintiff will be personally liable for the costs, and is insolvent (Darby v. Condit, 1 Duer, 599), and has been guilty of bad faith. (Shepherd v. Burt, 3 Duer, 645.) The court justly observes, that such cases can rarely occur, and, as it de- clined to commit itself to the requirement of security even in those cases (Darby v. Coludit, supra), we recom- mend every trustee of an insolvent estate to sue in that court, if he possibly can.,We recognize the full power of the court to make this decision for its own guidance, as the matter is purely dis- cretionary; but we respectfully dissent from its opinion as to the intention of the legislature, and the meaning of the clause referred to. In our judgment, the legislature meant to authorize the courts to require security in the very cases in which the Superior court declared (Darby v. Condit) that it never would do so, namely, when the plaintiff can not be made personally liable for costs. For in other cases, the defendant has the same security which he has in ordinary actions, and ought not to be specially favored.,Gross carelessness in unnecessarily instituting a suit by a receiver, has been held good reason for requiring him to give security for costs. (Kimberly v. Goodrich, sp. 288
In what cases required. Effect of a change of parties. t, 22 How. 424; see Kimberly v. Blackcford, sp. t., id. 443; Kimberly v. Stewart, sp. t., id. 281.) I other eases.]-Though the language of the statute is not clear, we think that its fair construction implies that this security can only be required when all the plaintiffs fall within the range of persons specified, though they need not belong to the same class. An administrator, though necessarily suing on behalf of the estate, should, if a non-resident, give security for such costs as may be awarded against him personally. (furphy v. Darlington, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 85; overruling in effect, Goodrich v. Pendleton, 3 Johns. Ch. 520.) Action for, clattels.]-In the old action of replevin, the court refused to order the plaintiff to give security for costs, because he must have, and had, given sufficient security in his bond to the sheriff at the commencement of the action. (Rogers v. Hitchcock, 9 Wend. 462.) But, under the Code, the action may be commenced without security, and the provisional remedy of requisition, upon which security is required, is not, as it formerly was, an essential part of the action. And where the defendant has, by giving security, obtained a return of the property to himself, he is entitled to the usual security for costs from a plaintiff non-resident, insolvent, &c. (Gelch v. Barnaby, sp. t., 7 Abb. 19; 1 Bosw. 657.) In Boucher v. Pia, (14 Abb. 1) it appearing that a non-resident plaintiff had given security for $300 only, the property being worth $150, he was required to file security for costs under the statute. In Wisconsin, &c., Ins. Co. v. Hobbs (sp.t., 22 How. 494), the security given on taking the property appearing to be sufficient, no bond was required under the statute. Effect of a change of parties.]-An assignment of the caim by a non-resident plaintiff to a resident, pending,37,289
.~~ In what cases required. Effect of omission to file security. the action, will not obviate the necessity of giving secu. rity for costs. (Plemnix v. Townshendi, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 2; 2 Sands. 634 n.),Discretion of tie court.]-TThe court is not bound, in every instance in which the defendant makes out a case within the terms of the Revised Statutes, to enforce the filing of security (Fearn v. Gelpc7e, sp. t., 13 Abb. 473; Florence v. BuIlkey, 1 Duer, 705; Robinson v. Sinclair, 1 Denio, 628), though we do not suppose that the decision of the special term is unappealable.,The court has an absolute discretion in applications under the Code, as against executors, trustees, &c., and its decision cannot be appealed from (see Code, Â§ 317), unless it orders security in a case in which it really has no authority to do so, or refuses the order on the ground of want of power, when it has power.,ART. 2.-Effect of omission to file security. Liability of attorney.]-In the first five cases mentioned in the preceding article, being those only in which under the Revised Statutes the plaintiff may be required to give security at the commencement of the action, the plaintiff's attorney is liable for the costs, until due security has been filed, to the extent of one hundred dollars; whether the defendant demands security or not. (3 B. S. (57th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620].) The rule of court, under which former deci- sions held the plaintiff's attorney liable for costs after the plaintiff became a non-resident, though he was a resident at the commencement of the suit (see 2 Wend. 258), was abrogated by the Revised Statutes, and those decisions are no longer in force. (Moir v. Brown, sp. t., 9 How. 270; Long v. Hall, 3 Sands. 729; Code Rep. N. S. 114; Alexan der v. Carpenter, 3 Denio, 266.),The attorney will not be relieved from liability by the fact that the action was brought for the benefit, and under the direction, of a resident of the state, whose name does not appear on the record. (Jones v. Savage, 10 Wend. 621.) 290
EB'ect of onlissiol to file. When to be demanded. gowc relieved from liability.]-The attolrey may relieve himself from liability by filing security in the same man- ner as is hereafter specified; and by giving notice thereof to the defendant. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620]). The sureties must justify, if excepted to, in the same manner as when security is given by the plaintiff: (Ib.) For the mode of proceeding, see post, p. 299. Foreign corsporations.]-The omission to file security on behalf of a foreign corporation plaintiff is an irregularity, on account of which the proceedings may be set aside on motion (Bank of Michigan v. Jessup, 19 Wend. 10; see Sferchaats' Bank v. Mills, 3 E. D. Smith, 214); but it does not affect the jurisdiction of the court (3Merchants' Bank v. Mills, supra; Persse & Brooks Co. v. TWillett, sp. t., 14 Abb. 119), and is a mere irregularity, which may be waived by delaying to object (Persse & Brooks Co. v. Willett supra), or cured by filing such security at any time. even after notice of motion to set aside the proceedings on that account (Bank of Michigan v. Jessl)u, 19 XVend. 10); though it is usual to charge the plaintiff with the costs of the motion in such case. (Ib.) It is unnecessary to give forms for such a motion, as they may be framed from the precedents upon any other motion to set aside proceedings for irregularity. AT. 3.-At what stage of the action security should be,demanded. After appearance.I-Under the former practice, the defendant could not move for security for costs, until he bad, if the action was bailable, put in and perfected bail. (Thomas v. Wilson, 6 Hill, 257). But the process of arrest having no longer any connection with the commencement of the action, and the reason assigned for this decision being that the defendant ought to perfect his appearance before making the motion, we suppose that the only effect of the old rule upon the present practice is, that the,291
When to be demanded. After default defendant must appear unconditionally upon moving for security.,At any stage of the sttit.]-There is nothing in the statutes on the subject which limits the tilme within which the application must be made, and an order for security has been gWanted at an advanced stage of the action, although the fact of the plaintiff's non-residence was known to the defendant at the commencement (Burgess v. Gregory, 1 Edw. Ch. R. 450); but the fact of delay is one for the consideration of the court, and after the cause has been noticed for trial by the defendant with the full knowledge of the plaintiff's liability to file security, the court will usually deny the motion (Swan v. Mathews, 3 Duer, 613); and any unreasonable delay may induce the court to deny the motion (Florence v. Bulkley, 1 Duer, 705; Robinson, v. Sinelair, 1 Denio, 628); or, which seems to us the most proper course, the motion will be granted on condition that the defendant pay such costs as the plain. tiff will incur by reason of such delay,--e. g., the costs of a circuit when the cause is unnecessarily postponed by the proceedings. (See Carpenter v. Dozunilg, 6 Hill, 234.),After 7oftrdt.}-]-Tlle motion may be made even after the time to answer has expired, in that class of actions in which the plaintiff cannot take judgment for the amount demanded as of course, and in which, unless he should recover $50 or more, he must pay costs (Abbott v. Smith, sp. t., 8 How. 463); because in such cases, the defendant's default does not prove to the court that he cannot recover costs (lb.) But when the action is for debt only, and the complaint is verified (in which case judgment is taken for the amount demanded, as of course), or when the action is one in which the plaintiff, on a recovery of less than $50, also recovers an equal amount in costs, the defendant's failure to answer is a conclusive bar to this 292
When to be demanded. After judgment. After appeal. motion, because the plaintiff ought not to be required to give security for costs which can never accrue (see Butler v. Wood, sp. t., 10 How. 313); and we think that this rule should apply to equitable actions also, it being highly improbable that the defendant under such circumstances can recover costs. After jzudgmenlt.]-It is of course too late to move for security after judgment absolute has been rendered for the plaintiff, even though the plaintiff is a foreign corpo- ration. (See Merc7ants' Bank v. Mills, 3 E. D. Smith, 214.) And it is also too late after judgment with leave to answer anew on terms, unless such terms have been first complied with. (Butter v. Wood, sp. t., 10 How. 313.) But when judgment has been'ordered for the plaintiff in any action which might be tried before a justice, subject to an assess- ment of damages, the motion may be made at any time until the damages are ascertained, because they might amount to less than $50, and so the defendant be entitled to costs. (Abbott v. Smith, sp. t., 8 How. 463.) And when a default has been opened, and the defendant allowed to appear, he may demand security, even though the judg- ment is allowed to stand for the security of the plaintiff. (Gardner v. Kelly, 2 Sands. 633; 1 Code Rep. 120.) It seems that a delay of two years, during which time a verdict had been rendered for the plaintiff, and a new trial granted, would be fatal to the motion. (Hartford Quarry Co. v. Pejulleton, 4 Abb. 460.) After appeal.]-The motion may be made after the plaintiff has appealed from a judgment in favor of the defendant (Ranney v. Stringer, sp. t., 4 Bosw. 663; com- pare Steam NavigatioiG Co., v. Weed, sp. t., 8 How. 49); and it has been made and granted after a judgment for the plaintiff has been reversed in the court of last resort, and a new trial ordered. (Northrop v. Wright, sp. t., 1 How. 146.) But the defendant cannot be treated as a,293
Mode of application. To the court. To a judge. plaintiff when he appeals, and required to give security under this chapter. (Johltson v. Yeomans, sp. t., 8 How. 140.),ART. 4.--Mode of application. It is best to apply to the plaintiff's attorney in the fist instance, though it is not necessary to do so.,The motion may be made before the court, upon notice; or an order in the alternative, requiring the plaintiff to file security or show cause at the next special term, may be obtained from a judge of the court, or from any officer authorized to act as such. (Chamllin v. Pierce, 3 Wend. 445; Bronson v. Freeman, sp. t., 8 How. 493.),Motion before the court.]-If the motion is made before the court in the first instance, the usual notice must be given. (C7hamlUnli v. Pierce, 3 Wend. 445.),Application to a j((ge.]-A judge out of court in vacr- tion has the same power in the premises as the court (3 1. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620]), and so has any officer authorized to perform the duties of such judge (Moore v. Merritt, 9 Wend. 482), and his order, granted ex parte, requiring absolutely the filing of security, is not void (Bronson v. Frccm sn, sp. t., 8 How. 493), but it is irregu- lar, and will be set aside on motion (see ib.; Champli) v. Pierce, 3 Wend. 445), and as no authority is given by the statute to judges out of court, except in vacation, an abso- lute order, granted by a judge out of court during term time would be void, except in the first district. (See Code, O 401.),The proper method of proceeding before a judge out of court is to apply for an order that the plaintiff file security for costs within twenty days after service of the order, or show cause at the next special term, and that meanwhile all his proceedings be stayed. (Bronson v. Freeman, sp. t. 8 How. 493; C7hamplin v. Pierce, 3 Wend. 445.) Â§ 405 of the Code does not deprive judges out of court of this 294
Mode of application. Motion papers. Affidavit. power, notwithstanding that it amounts to a power to stay proceedings more than twenty days. (lasihblurne v. Langley, 16 Abb. 259.) As a stay of proceedings is almost indispensable upon this motion, we recommend this mode of proceeding in preference to an ordinary motion upon notice, as unless the plaintiff's consent to a stay is obtained, it will be neces- sary in either case to apply to a judge, and the papers will be more simple under this method. And the courts have expressed a decided preference for this mode of application. (See Colt v. Wheeler, sp. t., 12 Abb. 388.) Motion plapers.]-The application must, in either case, be founded upon an affidavit showing the facts which entitle the defeldant to security. (3 R, S. 5th ed. 910; [2 id. 620].) This affidavit may be made by any person, whether a party or not, and should be made by some one personally cognizant of the facts. It need not include an affidavit of merits, as the defendant may recover costs although judgment be given against him on the merits. (See Abbott v. Smith, sp. t., 8 How. 463.) But if an extension of the time to answer is desired, merits must be sworn to. (Platt v. Townsend, 3 Abb. 9; Duer, 668.) The affidavit may be as follows:,Â§ 236. Affidavit on motion for securityfor costs. [Title of cause.] COUNTY OF ............ : A. B., of ............, being duly sworn, says, that the plaintiff in this action does not reside within the jurisdiction of this court, but resides at ........... and so reided at tlhe commencement of this action: [or otherwise, accorl- ing to the facts.] [Jurat.] [Signature.] Although the preceding form contains all that is neces- sary under the statute, yet if there has been any delay in,295

Service of order. making the motion, it should be excused at the outset, as the plaintiff might show cause with an affidavit setting up the delay, and the defendant might not obtain leave to put in affidavits in reply. Any other ground of opposi. tion may also be very properly anticipated and avoided. ART. 5.-The order to show cause; and stay of proceedings,,On application to any judge of the court, or officer authorized to perform the duties of such (see ante, i. 275), in the manner described in the preceding article, he ought to grant an alternative order and a stay of proceed. ings. (See 3 1. S. (5th7 ed.) 910; [2 id. 620]; Bronso v. Freeman, sp. t., 8 How. 493; Champlin v. Pierce, 3 Wend. 445.),The order should require the plaintiff to file security or show cause why he should not do so-not, " why his com- plaint should not be dismissed." (Cadwell v. Manning, sp. t., 15 Abb. 271.),The order may be in the following form:,237. Order tofile security, or show cause. [Title of cause.],On the annexed affidavit, let the plaintiff file security for costs in the sum of .......... dollars, within twenty days after service of a copy of this order, or show cause at a special term, [(c.] why the same should not be ordered with costs. And meantimne,letall proceedings on the part of the plaintiff be stayed.,[Date.] [Signature of judge] Amount of security.]-The amount of security required must be at least $250 (3 R. . (5t7, ed.) 910; [2 id. 620]), but the court will rarely require a larger sum. (See Northrop v. Wright, sp. t., 1 How. 146.),Service of order.]--A copy of this order, and of the affidavit on which it is made, must be served on the plaintiff's attorney. The copy of the order must be certi 296
Order to show cause. Proceedings before the hearing. fled by the clerk, or the original must be shown-to the person on whom service is made. Effect of stay of proceedings.]-The defendant may pro- ceed in the action, though he has stayed the plaintiff's proceedings (Ch7amplin v. Petrie, 4 Wend. 209); but any proceeding on his part unconnected with this appli- cation will amount to a waiver of the order, as the plain- tiff must in justice be allowed to resist him in any step he may take. (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495.) Proceedings are stayed not merely until security is given, but until twenty days thereafter, unless the defend- ant excepts to the sureties sooner, and after exception, until justification. (Colt v. Wheeler, sp. t., 12 Abb. 388.) If the plaintiff, before service of the order, gave notice of any motion, lie should attend at the hearing, and post- pone it, or countermand the notice, otherwise the defend- ant may recover costs of motion. (Rice v. Betts, 6 Paige, 44.) The order staying proceedings does not extend the time to answer. (Platt v. Townsenld, 3 Abb. 9; 5 Duer, 668; S'Golwn v. Leavelnorth, 2 E. D. Smith, 31.) Rerocation of this order.]-The alternative order being made (as we take for granted), without notice to the plaintiff, may be revoked by the officer granting it, with- out notice to the defendant. (Code, Â§ 324; Moore v. Merritt, 9 Wend. 482.) Of course, notice of the revocation must be given as soon as it is obtained, it is only of the appli- cation for revocation that notice is unnecessary.,ART. 6.-Proceedings before the hearing. Filing security.]-If the facts of the case justify the demand of security, the plaintiff should promptly file and give notice of the same, in order to save costs, and to enable himself to proceed with his action. If security is filed and notice given, before the day,38,297
Proceedings before the hearing. Absolute order. appointed for a hearing, the defendant should inmme. diately countermand the notice or order to show cause and proceed as in other cases where security is filed. (Micklethlwaite v. Rhodes, 4 Sands. Ch. 434.) But the stay of proceedings is not discharged until the time for excep. tion expires, or if exception is duly made, until the sureties have justified. (Colt v. W7iecler, sp. t., 12 Abb. 38S.),Showing cause against order.]-But if the defendant is not entitled to security, the plaintiff should resist the ap. plication with affidavits setting forth the facts, showing either that the case is not one specified by the statutes, or some reason why the discretion of the court should not be used in favor of the defendant.,An affidavit of the plaintiff's residence in the jurisdic- tion, when that question is at issue, must not only state that he " is in" the jurisdiction, but that he resides, and intends to continue to reside there. (Oliva v. Johnson, 5 Barn. & Aid. 90S.),ART. 7.-lMakiing the order absolute. If the plaintiff fails to appear on the day on which the order to show cause is returnable, or if the defendant establishes his case, the order will be made absolute.,But if, before the hearing, the plaintiff has filed and given due notice of security pursuant to the order, and the defendant nevertheless persists in his motion, it will be denied with costs. (Micklethwaite v. Rhodes, 4 Sands. Ch. 434.),The order, when granted, may be in the following terms:,2 238. Order to file security for costs. [Title of cause.],On reading and filing [&c.] and on motion of [&ec.J ORDERED: 1. That the plaintiff file security for costs as required by the said order, and give due notice thereof to the defendant. 298

That all proceedings on the part of the plaintiff be stayed until such security and notice have been given, and until justifica- tion of the sureties, if excepted to. 3. That the defendant recover .... dollars costs of motion.,ART. 8.-Defendant's proceedings on the order. Service.]-The order is of no effect until a copy thereof has been duly served on the plaintiff's attorney. (Ander- so91 v. Osborn. sp. t., 1 How. 79.) Enforcemenet of the order.]-If the plaintiff omits to file security within the time prescribed by the order, or within twenty days after service, in case no time is prescribed thereby (ante i. 197, Rtue 57), the defendant may move to dismiss the complaint as for want of diligence in the action. (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495; Glover v. Ctum- ing, 12 Wend. 295; Chanmplin v. Petrie, 4 Wend. 209.) On receiving notice of this motion, the plaintiff may still file security, on paying the costs of motion (see Glover v. Ctling, supra), otherwise the motion will be granted. Of course any proceedings taken by the plaintiff before filing security will be irregular, and may be set aside with costs on motion. Waiver of order.]-Tle defendant waives the order by noticing the cause for trial (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495; Hay v. Power, 2 Edw. Ch. R. 494); or, we presume, by taking any step in the action except to enforce the order.,ART. 9.-The security, and proceedings thereon. The security.]-The security must be in the form of a bond, in a penalty of at least two hundred and fifty dol- lars, with one or more sufficient sureties, conditioned to pay to the defendant, on demand, all costs that may be awarded to him in the action. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620].) It will be sufficient, though it may not follow the precise words of the statute, if it is equally favorable to the defendant. (Smlith v. Norval, 2 Code Rep. 14.),299
The security, and proceedings thereon. Bond for defendant' costs. Thus, if the words "on demand" are omitted, the bond is nevertheless good. (Ib.) The condition must be that the obligors,-not the plaintiffs,-will pay the costs. The defendant must not be required to find the plaintiff and make a demand upon him. (Tallnadge v. Wallis, sp; t., 1 How. 100.),The penalty of the bond cannot be less, but need not be more than $250, unless otherwise specially ordered by the court, which is rarely done (see NTorthtrop v. Wright, sp. t., 1 How. 146); and such an order will not in any case be made unless applied for within twenty days after notice of the security. (Castellanos v. Jones, 4 Sands. 679.),The regular form of the bond is as follows:,Â§ 239. Bond for defendant's costs. KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that I, A. B., of ...... am held and firmly bound unto C.

Filing and notice. founded partly on reasons that ceased to exist hundreds of years ago, and still more on the very natural desire of lawyers, when paid by the folio, as they were until re- cently, to increase their fees, we prefer to deal gently with these monuments of ancient wisdom. The sureties must acknowledge the bond before a commissioner, in the same manner as deeds of land are acknowledged, previous to filing it. (Rule 6, Supreme Ct.) If not so acknowledged, the bond may be treated as a nullity, though it seems that the deilendant ouglht to notify the plaintiff of the defect. (Colt v. Wheeler, sp. t., 12 Abb. 388.) It will be of little avail to justify at this stage, as tile jlstification would have to be repeated upon exception (Waslhburnle v. Langley, 16 Abb. 259; Bronson v. Freeman, sp. t., 8 How. 494), and the stay of proceedings will not be discharged thereby; but in the New York Common Pleas, under an old rule, the plaintiff may serve a copy of an affidavit of justification, and give two days' notice of a time and place at which the sureties will appear and justify, and on such justification, thle stay will be dis- clarged. (Colt v. Irhleekr, sp. t., 12 Abb. 388.) No such rule appears to have been adopted in any other court. Stlreties.]-Tlle plaintiff need not join in thle execution of the bond. (Micletthwaite v. lRhodes, 4 Sands. Ch. 434; Waiiier v. Adtams, sp. t., 1 How. 191.) One surety is sufficient, unless more are required by the terms of the order (Ib.; see BRiggins v. Williwams, 2 Duer, 678); and though it has been said tlat if there is only one surety, the plaintiff must join with him (Wlragner v. Adams, supra), this is not required. (Micklethwaite v.

A voluntary justification, before notice of exception, will not defeat the right of tle defendant to except, nor obviate the necessity of a new justification after excep- tion. (]fashburneie v.

[Date and address.] [Signature.] Upon service of tlhe affidavit of justification, the stay of proceedings is ipso facto discharged. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 910; [2 id. 620].)

AIT. 1.-Of ithe lpocccding i n general. Before the IRevised Statutes, tile only method by which tlhe defendant could settle the action, without the consent; of the plaintiff, was by paying the debt and costs into court. This could only be done in a limited class of actions, and as the remedy provided by tlhe statute is more simple and comprehensive, including all the cases provided for b)y the old practice, and more, the former proceeding has become practically obsolete. All further account of it is therefore omitted, but any reader who desires to examine the old practice will find it ably treated in 1 Burr. Pr. 406, 409. The Revised Statutes permit the defendant, in certain eases, to tender such atmount as lie considers just, to the plaintiff, and after such tender, the plaintiff proceeds at his own risk in regard to costs, as hereafter stated. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 868; [2 id. 553].) These provisions are retained in force by Â§ 471 of the Code.,39,305
In what cases allowed. Manner and time of tender.,ART. 2.-In Cwhat cases allowed. The defendant may make a tender, in the manner and with the effect hereafter stated, in any action of the class formerly called legal, brought for the recovery of a sum certain, or which may be reduced to certainty by calcula. tion, or for a casual or involuntary trespass or injury. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 868; [2 id. 553].),The statute does not apply to equitable actions of dny kind, including actions of foreclosure (Thurston v. Marslh, sp. t., 5 Abb. 391; 14 How. 572; Newv York Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Burrell, sp. t., 9 How. 398); though a tender in such an action, where the main object of the action is money, e. g., an action of foreclosure, may be made, and if made promptly, will be taken into consider. ation by the court ii settling the costs, with advantage to the defendant. (Pratt v. Ramsdell, 16 How. 59.),Tender may be made under the statute in an action on a bond for the payment of injuries unintentionally inflicted by the defendant. (Slack v. Brown, 13 Wend. 390.),ART. 3.-7Manner and time of tender. Time.]--Tender may be made at any stage of the pro- ceedings, before trial, or before damages are assessed, or before judgment rendered in an action for debt. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 868; [2 id. 553].) As there is now no action of debt within the meaning of the statute, and as some causes of action could be prosecuted either in debt or assumpsit, we think that tender should be made in all cases before trial or assessment.,Mlanner of maling tender.I]-Tender is to be made by offering to the plaintiff or his attorney a sum sufficient to satisfy the demand of, or compensate the injury done to the plaintiff (of which the defendant must judge at his own risk), and also the costs of the action up to the time of tender. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 868; [2 id. 554].) 306
Manner of making tender. Effect of tender. The money must be actually presented to the plaintiff; and it is not enough to make a verbal offer to pay it, even though the person making the offer has it in his pocket (Baletman v. Pooler, 15 Wend. 637), unless the plaintiff absolutely refuse to receive it if tendered; but as even in that case it must be proved that the person offering to pay had the money in his possession, it is always the better course to make a literal tender of it. The tender should, strictly speaking, be made in lawful money; but a tender in bank notes is good, unless the plaintiff objects upon that ground at the time. As the costs cannot always be settled on the moment, we presume that an offer to pay them as soon as they could be adjusted, would be held sufficicnt,--and so, per- haps, might an offer to pay the interest due, if any (see Slack v. Brown, 13 Wend. 392), but as this is a liberal construction of thle statute, we do not advise the defend- ant to rely upon it, unless it is necessary for himn to do so. A tellder, after the colmmencement of the action, of the amount demand(ed by the complaint, without any offer to pay the costs, is, if refused by the plaintiff, entirely un- availing. (Rocefeller v. Weiderwax, sp. t., 3 How. 382; Metan v. Drevw, 19 Wend. 304); but unless the action has been actually commenced, no costs need be tendered, even though the summons and complaint have been issued for service. (Hiull v. Peters, 7 Barb. 331.),ART. 4.-Effect of tender. When a(ccepted.]-If the plaintiff accepts the amount tendered, and proceeds in the action, as he may do, the snm so accepted must be deducted from the amount re- covered by him on the trial, and judgment rendered for the residue only (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 868; [2 id. 554]); and the rights of the respective parties to costs will depend on the amount of such residue (ib.); that is, the amount of such residue will be regarded as the entire amount of the plaintiff's recovery, within the general law of costs,307
Effect of tender. When not accepted. (see Slack v. Brown, 13 Wend. 394); so, that if such resi- due amounts to less than fifty dollars, the defendant will recover costs, unless the action is one of which a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction (see- Peet v. Warthl, 1 BSosw. 653; Lantdsberger v. M(aganetic Telegralph Co., sp. t., 8 Abb. 35; Code, Â§Â§ 304, 305); and if there is no such residue, the defendant will be in all cases entitled to full costs of the action.,It has been held, that the plaintiff may accept the fuil amount of his claim, and yet proceed, if his costs are not paid, and recover full costs (Bogarduts v. lichtneyer, sp. t., 3 Abb. 179); but we think that this decision was erroneous, as the word "recovery," used in the statute, evidently refers to the verdict, and does not include costs, which are made dependent on the amount of the "reco- very." It is plainly the intention of the statute that the plaintiff shall elect, when the amount of the debt, with- out costs, is tendered to him, to accept the same in full, or to refuse it. In the case of Boyarduts v. licehtieyer, supra, the amount of the debt was paid to a clerk of the plaintiffs, who was not aware that an action had been commenced; but as the plaintiffs retained the money, this was an acceptance on their part. If they desired to secure the costs, they should have returned the amount paid. The court, in its decision, referred to the practice on paying money into court, but the analogy does not hold good, the case being expressly provided for by statute.,VlWhe not accepted.]-If the plaintiff refuses to accept the amount tendered, and upon the trial of the cause, or assessment of danmag(es, it appears that such amount was sufficient to pay his demand, or was a sufficient amends for the injury done, he can recover no interest or costs accruing after the time of the tender, but must pay the defendant's costs from that time. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 868; S id. 554). And though an attachment has been issued, he 308
Efect of tender. When not accepted. Proceedings after tender. cannot have the usual allowance under Â§ 308 of the Code. (Pratt v. Conkey, sp. t., 15 How. 27.) But if the plaintiff recovers six cents more than was tendered to him, he will also recover full posts. (Slack v. Brown, 13 Wend. 394.) The plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for the amount tendered, in any event (Slack v. Brown, supra); and lhe may, at any stage of the action, give notice to the defend- ant that he accepts the tender, and the defendant must, within a reasonable time, pay the amount, deducting his own costs from the time of tender, or the plaintiff will again be entitled to costs from the time of his offer of acceptance. (Ib.),ART. 5.-Proceedings after tender. A tender under the statute is not a proper subject for an answer. So at least it was held by the lNew York Superior Court. (Graham v. Gedney, Grah. Pr. [2d ed.] 514, n.) Nor can the proceedings in the action be stayed by reason of such tender having been made. The plaintiff has a right to proceed to trial at his own risk as to costs. (Rooikefeller v. WVeiderwax, sp. t., 3 Iow. 382.) The whole subject is to be settled at the trial, upon evidence of the tender, which is of course admissible, though not set up in the pleadings. When the plaintiff has accepted the amount tendered, an entry of such tender and acceptance is to be made on the record. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) S69; [2 id. 554].) When a tender has been made in an action brought to recover damages for an injury, the defendant must, in order to secure the advantages of such tender, obtain a certificate from the judge presiding at the trial that the injury complained of was casual or involuntary. (Slack v. Bron,!, 13 Wend. 395.) This certificate may be entered on the minutes, or be made on a separate paper. (See 3 R. . (5th ed.) 933; [2 id. 653].),309
Proceedings after tender. Of the proceeding in general If the plaintiff accepts the tender as sufficient, he should obtain the defendant's consent to a discontinuance with. out costs. If the defendant refused his consent, the court would undoubtedly grant the order upon proper applica. tion.,CHAPTER LXXVI. OFFER OF JUDGMENT. ABTICLE 1. Of the proceeding in general.,2. In what cases and at what stage of the action allowed. 3. By whom made. 4. llow made. 5. Proceedings subsequent to the offer. ART. 1.-Of the lCroceeding in general. A remedy for the saving of costs in indefensible actions, broader still than the provisions of the Revised Statutes, has been introduced by the Code. By it the defendant is permitted to offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for such relief as he may think the plaintiff entitled to, and the plaintiff must elect to accept or refuse suo: offer, at the risk of losing costs if lie fails to obtain a more favorable judgment. (Code, Â§ 385.),This proceeding is regarded as a substitute for the old cognovit, and not for the bond and warrant of attorney of the former practice. (Ross v. Bridge, 15 Abb. 150; 24 How. 163.),It has been remarked that this section of the Code has been perverted, in common practice, into a substitute for a confession of judgment, it being an easier and safer method of proceeding than the latter, while by agreement between the parties, it can be conducted just as rapidly to a conclusion. (See Bridenlbecker v. Mason, sp. t., 16 How. 203.) 310
In what cases allowed. By whom made. ART. 2.--I what cases, and at what state of the action,allowed. In what cases.]-This proceeding may be taken in any action, whether legal or equitable, there being no restric- tion made in this respect by the Code. At what stage of the action.-The offer may be made at any time before the trial or verdict (Code, Â§ 385); even before the service of the complaint. (See Kilts v. Seeber, sp. t., 10 How. 273.) IBut it is highly expedient that the offer should be made at least ten days before the trial, as the plaintiff's proceedings are not stayed, and if, within the ten days allowed him to accept or refuse the offer, he obtains a verdict, the defendant can have no benefit from his offer (Pomeroy v. Itulin, 7 How. 161), while the defend- ant is precluded from taking judgment by default if the cause is reached on the calendar within that time. (Walker v. Iohinson, sp. t., 8 How. 240.),ART. 3.-By 'whom made. The offer is of course to be made by the defendant, or his attorney, who has power to make it for him. (Sterne v. Bentley, sp. t., 3 How. 331.) In an action against joint debtors, the offer must be joined in by all the defendants who have been served with the summons, and whose time for answering has not expired (Binney v. Le Gal, 19 Barb. 592; 1 Abb. 283; Bridenbeceker v. 2Mason, sp. t., 16 How. 203; see Grifiths v. De Forest, 16 Abb. 292), even though the defendants are partners, for one partner has no authority to make such an offer on behalf of his fellow-partners; and a judgment entered upon an offer made by one defendant where several have been served, and their time for answer- ing had not expired at the time of the offer, will be set aside on application of the other defendants. (Ib.) Where the action is brought against joint debtors, and the sum- mons is served on one only, he may make this offer, and,311
By whom made. The offer, how made. judgment may be entered in the usual form against the joint property of all (Emecry v. Emery, sp. t., 9 How. 130; Lippntan v. Joelson, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 161 71.; Olcell v. M'.Lauglini, sp. t., 10 l. . Leg. Obs. 316); unless the pro- ceeding is taken by collusion between the plaintiff and the defendant served, with intent to overreach the other defendant, ill which case the judgment will not be allowed to stand. (Everson v. Geltrman, 1 Abb. 167; 10 How. 301.),An offer made by an attorney of the court, in tle name of the defendants, is valid in all cases, whether he is authorized to appear for them or not, if there is no collu- sion between him and the plaintiff, nor other fraud, or unless it is shown that the attorney is irresponsible (Blodgett v. Conklin, sp. t., 9 How. 442; Sterne v. Bentley, sp. t., 3 How. 331; see Binney v. Le Gal, 19 Barb. 592; 1 Abb. 283; Bridenbecker v. lMason, sp. t., 16 How. 203; Grazebrook v. M3'Creedie, 9 Wend. 437); but if any of the defendants have not authorized the attorney inalindg the offer to act for them, they will be allowed to dcfend the action, though the ju(dgment and proceedings thereon must stand as security. (Blodgctt v. Con1llin, sp. t., 9 How. 442; Sterne v. Ben tlcy, sp. t., 3 Iow. 331; Graztcbrook v. il' Crccdic, 9 Wend. 437.),If all the defendants are served with the summons, and any of them allow their time for answering to expire, the others may make an offer of judgment, even where lhe defendants are joint debtors. (La lForge v. Chilson, 3 Sands. 752; Code Iep. N. S. 159.),ART. 4.-The offer, how mlade. The offer must be made in writing, specifying the judg- ment which the defendant is willing to allow, witl costs. It must be served on the plaintiff's attorney. (Code, Â§ 385.),It may allow judgment to be taken for the whole, as well as for a part of the plaintiff's claim, and cannot be objected to by other creditors on that account. (Ross v. Bridge, 15 Abb. 150; 24 How. 163.) . 312
Hlow made. By whom signed. It must expressly state that judgment may be taken tcith costs, or it will be a nullity. (Ranncy v. Russell, 3 Dner, 689.) It should be so distinctly made as to leave no doubt as to its meaning or extent. (Post v. Neiv York Central .R. R. Co., sp. t., 12 How. 552.) But it is not absolutely necessary that it should be complete in itself,-it may refer to the pleadings, and if by such reference and by mere arithmetical calculation the amount of the judgment can be ascertained, it will be sufficient. (Burnett v. Westfall, 15 How. 420.) Thus, where an offer was made to allow judgment "for the amount demanded in the summons, less the amount of the two notes of J. W., mentioned in the answer," these notes being pleaded as a set-off in the answer, and their dates and amounts being of course given therein, the offer was held to be 00good. (Ib.) The offer must be unconditional, or no judgment can be entered thereon. (Pinjlot7el/ v. Childs, 7 Bosw. (i0; 15 Abb. 137 it.) And it must be so made, that the plaintiff will not, by accepting it, be in any way prejudiced in his rights against other parties. (Griffiths v. De Forest, 16 Abb. 292.),Where the defendants are jointly liable, the offer must be signed either by an attorney appearing for all, or by all the defendants personally (Bridclnbecker v. Mason, sp. t., 16 How. 203; see Griffiths v. De Forcst, 16 Abb. 292, and note), unless one or more of them have failed to answer, in which case an offer, signed by all who are not in defiult, will be good. (La Foge v. Cbilso,, 3 Sands. 752; Code Rep. N. S. 159.) A partner in a firm has no authority to sign for his copartners (Binney v. Le Gal, 19 Barb. 592; 1 Abb. 283; Bridenbeclr v. .Mason, sp. t., 10 How. 203); and if le had, his signature in the firm name would not suffice; so that an offer signed "A. B. & Co." binds A. B. alone. (Bridenb)ecker v. M2Iason, supra.) The offer may be in the following form:,40,313
_ _- How made. Form. Subsequent proceedings.,Â§ 244. Offer to allow judgment. [Title of cause.],PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that the defendant offers to allow judg. ment to be entered against him in this action, for [one thousand dollars], with costs.,[Date.] [Signature.] [Address.] This offer must be served on the plaintiff's attorney. If the answer has not been served at the time of making the offer, and it is the intention of the defendant to plead a counterclaim, the offer must refer to such counter- claim in some manner, so as to extinguish it if the offer is accepted; or in case the plaintiff recovers a sum which, inicluding the counterclaim, is larger than that offered by the defendant, the latter will lose the benefit of his offer. (See Buggles v. Fogg, sp. t., 7 How. 324.),ART. 5.-Proceedings subsequent to the offer. Defendant's procedings.]-As the plaintiff is entitled to ten days after service of the offer in which to decide whether to accept or reject it, the defendant cannot, within that time, take any proceedings in the action to the plaintiff's prejudice, as for instance, a judgment by default at the circuit. (lalker v. Johnson, sp. t., S How. 240.),We do not suppose, however, that the defendant is stayed from taking steps of a merely formal character, such as pleading, giving notice of trial, &c., which cannot incon- venience the plaintiff.,Plaintiff's proceedings.]-The plaintiff's proceedings are not stayed in any respect by the offer. (Poimeroy v. ltulin, 7 How. 1C1.) But an amendment of the complaint in no way affects a prior offer. (Kilts v. Seebcr, sp. t., 10 How. 270.) 314
Subsequent proceedings. Acceptance of offer. Non-accep!ance. Accepltance.]-The plaintiff is allowed ten day from the time of service of the order, within which to accept or refuse it. If within that time he gives notice of acceptance in writing, lie may file the summons, complaint, and offer, with an affidavit of notice of acceptance; and the clerk must thereupon enterjudgment accordingly. (Code, Â§ 385.) This judgment may be entered without the direction of a judge. (Hill v. Northrop, sp. t., 9 How. 525.),The notice of acceptance may be in the following form:,Â§ 245. Acceptance of offer. [Title of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that the plaintiff accepts the defendant's offer ofjudgrment, dated ........., .... .. [Date.] [Signature.] [Address.] This notice must be served upon the defendant's attorney. An affidavit of service should be annexed to a copy of the notice, and filed with the clerk. For forms of such affidavits, see ante, i. 443. If, in an action for debt, the plaintiff accepts an offer to enter judgment for less than $50, the defendant is entitled to costs. (Johnson v. Sagar, sp. t., 10 How. 552.) Non-acceptancee.]-The mere omission to serve a notice of acceptance within ten days is sufficient rejection of the offer; and thereupon it is deemed to be withdrawn, and cannot be given in evidence. (Code, Â§ 385.) But if the plaintiff fhils to obtain a more favorable judgment, lie can- not recover costs, but must pay the defendant's costs from the time of the offer. (Ib.) In order to ascertain whether the judgment recovered by the plaintiff is as favorable as that offered by the de- fendant, interest must be added to the amount of the offer (if it was for a judgment for money), from the time of such offer. (Schleider v. Jacobi, 1 Duer, 694; Rug-,315
Offer of judgment. Non-acceptance.,-- gles v. Fogg, sp. t., 7 How. 324.) If the offer was served before the answer, and the latter set up a counter- claim, which the plaintiff extinguishes, and the amount of such counterclaim, added to the plaintiff's recovery, exceeds the amount offered by the defendant, the plaintiff will be eltitled to costs, as if lie had accepted the offer, the counterclaim would have been left in force. (Fieldings v. Mills, 2 Bosw. 499; ltB glces v. eFogg, supra.) But if the offer is served after such an answer, its acceptance will extinguish tile counterclaim, and therefore, unless the plaintiff's actual recovery exceeds the amount offered, lie must pay costs. (Schneider v. Jacobi, 1 Duer, G94; ifilts v. Seecber, sp. t., 10 How. 270.),The plaintiff is, in any event, entitled to his costs up to tlhe time of lmaking the offer. (Burnett v. Westfall, sp. t., 15 Ihow. 430; ieese v. Tljltnant, sp. t., 8 How. 88.) And the defendant cannot in any case, where judgment is rendered for the plaintiff, even though costs are awarded against the latter, have an extra allowance. (lIcLees v. Aeery, sp. t., 4 How. 441; see Butrnett v. Westfall, 15 How. 420; Keese v. WIyman, sp. t., 8 How. SS.) A single judg- ment must be entered in tle cause for the net amount due to cither party after adjusting the costs.

We cannot find any decisions in reference to this sec- tion, which seems to be but rarely taken advantage of. The proceeding may undoubtedly be taken in any action ,arising upon contract," but in practice, it can hardly be made available in any action except for unliquidated damages on breach of contract. An offer not served 'iithi the answer is unauthorized, and may of course be disre- garded, and the same may be remarked of an offer not in writing.,The offer may be in the following form:,Â§ 246.

[Title of cause.] PLEASE TAKLE NOTICE, that the defendant hereby offers, in case he fails in his defense upon the trial, to assess the plaintiff's damages at........ dollars. [Date.] [Signature.] [Address.],ART. 2.--Procedigs utpol the offer. The plaintiff is at liberty to accept or refuse the offer, up to the time of noticing the cause for trial. If lie accept it, lie must serve a written notice of his acceptance on the defendant's attorney, with or before the notice of trial. (Code, Â§ 386.),This notice may be as follows:,Â§ 247. Notice of acceptance. [Title of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that the plaintiff accepts the defendant's oflfr to liquidate the damages therein. [Date.] [SIgnlature.] [Address.],317
Proceedings after offer. Effect of acceptance or non-acceptance. Effect of accel)tance.]--If, after acceptance of this offer, the plaintiff recovers a verdict, his damages must be as- sessed at the amount specified in the offer. (Code, Â§ 386.) It has been said that the effect of the offer, when accept- ed, is to admit the plaintiff's cause of action, and throw the burden of proof upon the defendant (Holmles & Dis. Pr. 171); but this is an extraordinary suggestion, so utterly unfounded as scarcely to deserve notice. The plaintiff must undoubtedly prove a breach of contr,, (t, as in other cases, but need not prove the amount of his damages.,Non-acceptance and its effect.]-Tlie omission to serve notice of acceptance at the proper time is a sufficient refilsal of the offer.,If the offer is not accepted, the plaintiff must prove his damages, as if it had not been made, and cannot give it in evidence. And if the damages assessed in his filvor do not exceed the sum mentioned in the offer, the defend- ant may recover his expenses, incurred in consequence of any necessary preparation or defense in respect to tile question of damages (Code, Â§ 386). Such expense must be ascertained at the trial (ib.), and if not claimed and settled then, cannot be afterwards demanded. 318

AUT. 1.-In what cases ordered. In what cases.]-Alhen the answrc of the defendant, expressly or by not denying, admits part of the plaintiff's claim to be just, the court, on motion, may order such defendant to satisfy that part of the claim. (Code, Â§ 244.) The order cannot be granted if the answer admits the wthole claim of the plaintiff, as a sufficient remedy is pro- vided in such case by the proceeding to obtain judl'ment on the frivolousness of the answer. (See Slawnson v. ( la7;ey, sp. t., 10 How. 57; disapproving S. C., 1 Abb. 228.) It may be made upon an admission of part of a single cause of action (Guiet v. Muirply, sp. t., 18 Ilow. 411; Quintard v. Sccor, sp. t., 3 E. I). Smith, 614; but see Russellv. 3Meacham , sp. t., 16 How. 193); and of course it may, where one of several causes of action is admitted. (Russell v. Mleachamn, sp. t., 16 How. 1.93.) Before the amendment of 1857, which relieved the courts from the necessity of enforcing the order by attachment, some judges refused to grant the order if the amount admitted to be due had been offered to the plaintiff before the commencement of the action (St. John v. Thiorne, sp. t.,
In what cases ordered. Admissiou must be clar.,_--_--- 2 Abb. 166), or after the commuencenent of the action, under Â§ 385 of the Code (Smith v. Olssen, 4 Sands. 711); and such was the settled practice of the New York Superior Court. (Ryder v. Union India Rubber Co., 1 Abb. 444 n1.) But as there is not now any peculiar stringency in tile operation of this proceeding, we think that these decisions lhave lost their foundation, and that the cases in the Co(illmon Pleas (Myers v. Trimble, 3 E, ]). Smith, 607; 1 Abb. 220; lerritt v. Thom1pson, 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 1 Abb. 223; 10 How. 428; Qiintar(l v. Secor, sp. t., 3 E. D. Smith, 614), will be followed, holding that a rejected offer, particularly under Â§ 385 of the Code, is no bar to an application for this order.,The same motives induced the courts in some cases to confine this order to cases of trust moneys (Diusenlberry v. lroodwl'rd, 1 Abb. 453), or claims for specific property (Lae v. Losec, sp. t., 2 Abb. 129; 11 How. 360); and for the same reason we consider these decisions obsolete, and tlink that there will be no flrther question as to the propriety of granting this order in all classes of actions.,The admission nmust be clear and obvious (Bender v. Sherwood, sp. t., 15 How. 258; Dolan v. .Petty, 4 Sands. 673); though it need not be made in express terms (Code, Â§ 244); and the amount conceded to be due must be ascertainable from tlhe pleadings alone, as the court cannot look ilto any other documents to construe them. (Coursen v. IIamlin, 2 ])uer, 518.),Whlere the defendant does not deny the allegations of the complaint, but sets up a counterclaim for an amount less than that demanded in the complaint, the plaintiff is entitled to an order for the satisfaction of the overplus. (Guiet v. rl7pluhy, sp. t., 18 How. 411; ilyers v. Trimnble, 3 E. I). Smith, 607; 1 Abb. 220.) Where the defendant has paid a fiund into court, and acknowledges the right of the plaintiff to a part of it, the latter is entitled to this order for that part of his claim. (Merritt v. Thompson, 1 320
~~- - In what cases. The motion. Abb. 223; 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 10 How. 428.) But where the defendant, while admitting that he is in possession of a fund to which the plaintiff has a partial right, never- theless insists that there are unsettled claims against it which may reduce its amount, the order should not be granted for an amount including the disputed claims, unless the plailntiff will give security for the payment of his portion thereof, in case they are established. (Roberts v. Law, 4 Sands. 642.) At cwhat stage of the action.]-This application may be made at any time after answering, up to the time of trial. The order has been granted at the trial (Coursen v. 11am- lin, 2 Duer, C13), but should not be allowed afterwards, as by taking a verdict the plaintiff ought to be deemed to waive his right to this remedy, and should be left to the ordinary course of recovery.,ART. 2.-Applieationr for the order. The application for this order mnst be made to the court, and not to a judge out of court. (Code, Â§ 244.),Â§ 248. Notice of motion for satisfaction of part of plaintiff's claim. [Title of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, tliat on the pleadings in this action, the plaintiff will move this court, at [Cldc.], that tle defendant be re- quired to satisfy so miuch of the plainitiif's claim as is admitted by the answer, to wit, the slin of ...... dollars, [or otherwise, as the ease nmaybe,] or for [ lc.] [Date and address.] [Signjatures.] It is advisable that the notice should clearly state the precise amount supposed by the plaintiff to be admitted by the answer.

On receipt of such an offer, the plaintiff should accept it, if it concedes all his rights, and should counter- mand the notice; as otherwise he cannot recover, and may have to pay, costs.,ART. 3.-Thte order, and discretion of the court thereon. Discretion of the court.]-The court is not bound to grant the order in all cases which come within the letter of the statute, but may exercise its discretion in granting or refusing it. (St. John v. Thorle, sp. t., 2 Abb. 166.) The decision of the special term is, however, not conclu- sive, but subject to appeal in any case, the order being a provisional remedy (Code, Â§ 349), though the general term will not review the decision il respect to terms or condi- tions which do not prejudice any substantial right of either party. (See Merritt v. Tlhompson, 1 Abb. 223; 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 10 How. 428.),7the order.]-The order should state explicitly what is required of the defendant, and should prescribe the method of its enforcement.,As is more fully stated hereafter, it may direct the issuance of an execution or an attachment, according to the nature of the demand.,It may be in the following terms:,249. Order to satisfy part of ylaintiff's elilu. [Title of cause.],On reading and filing the complaint and answer in this action, and notice of this motion, on motion of [&c.],ORDERED: 1. That the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of........ dollars [or othenrise], admitted by him to be due; and also ........ dollars, costs of motion.,2.

That if tile Same be not paid witlin ........ days after sert.ice of this order, an attachlieitt issue against the defendant; and that the plaintiff proceed in the action for the remainder of his claim.] If the order permit an attachment for non-payment, a certified copy of the order must be served on the defend- ant personally, otherwise it need not (ante, i. 427); and in any case a certified copy must be served on his at- torney.,ART. 4.-Eltforcemntet of the order. The order nay be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or provisional remedy (Code, Â§ 244); in other words, by execution or attachment for contempt. The order may, and should, in eases in which the debt or demand is i;ot one for which the defendant could be arrested under the non-ilnprisonmllJenlt act, or under the Code, direct an ordinary judgment and execution in favor of the plaintiff (Duincan v. Ainslie, 26 Barb. 199; see Guiet v. Murphly, sp. t., 18 How. 411); or it may direct an exe- cution to issue without judgment (Russell v. Meadcam, sp. t., 16 How. 193), but if the debt is one for which the defendant's person might be taken in exctutio-i, or if the order requires the lpc)'rsin'ice of soIe act entirely within his power, e. g., the execution of a deed, an attachment should issue. (See Bussell v. Meadclma, sp. t., 16 How. 193; Dusenbrry v. Woodward, 1 Abb. 455; Lane v. Losee, sp. t., 2 Abb. 129; 11 How. 300.) This is the settled con- struction of the Code since the alnendment of 1857. Prior to that amendment, the order could be enforced by attach- ment only, and the decisions upon the subject were conficting.

Proceedings under tIle order.,ART. 1.-Liratutre of theproceeding. The ere eetwo classes of cases, in which, under the old practice, the courts were accustomed to order the pay- mient of money into the hauds of their ownI officers. One class consisted of actions at law, in which the defendant alone could apply for the order, for the purpose of staying proceedings against himself; the other was confined to courts of equity, which granted the olrer on the applica- tion of either lurty in certain cases, most coummonly, hov-ever, at the instance of tlhe plaintitt. The proceeding used in courts of law, as stated il a previous chapter (ante, p. 305), Lhas become upactically obsolete, by reason of the superior remedies now Irovided for the salue pur- pose; and the prlocCeing of which we here treat is sub- stautially that which was used in courts of equity only, though now extended to all actions in which it may be found convenient.,'Th Code not only extetnds this remedy to all classes of actions, buti pernits the deposit of any article capable of delivery (Code, Â§ 244); whereas, under the old practi-e, money only seems to have been the subjeet of the pro- ceeding. (See 1 Barb. Ch..Pr. 236.) And if the court sees fit, it may order the property to be delivered to the person to whom it is due, iustead of to the court. (Code, 244.) 324
In what cases a deposit will be ordered. The adrnission.,ART. 2.-In what cases a deposit will be ordered. Any money or other thing capable of delivery, being the subject of the litigation, may be ordered to be de- posited in court or delivered to a party to the action, upon its being admitted by another party, in his pleading or examination, that such property is held by him as trustee for the former party, or that it belongs or is due to such party, and that it is in tie possession or under the control of the party making such admission. (C'odle, 24t4; see Burhtats v. Casey, 4 Sands 706.) The admissioal.]-The admission on which an applica- tion of this kind is founded, must be plainly made, and either state the amount due, or refer to documents which show the amount, in such manner as to make them a part of the pleading or examination in which the adinis- sion is made. (QuarrelI v. Bec7Cford, 14 Ves. 177; Mills v. Hanson, 8 Ves. 67, 91.) If tie defendant admits a sche- dule to be correct, but omits to foot it up, the plaintiff may proceed upon such admission, on presenting a verified computation of the amount due by the schedule. (See Quarrtll v. Becliford, supra; Wlood v. Down'es, 1 Yes. & B.49.) But if the defendant refiers to several documents, the plaintiff must prove a colpurtation founded upon all such documents. (Alills v. Hanson, 8 Ves. 91.),In some cases in equity the defendants were required to pay into court trust moneys which were not in their possession, as where executors acknowledged the receipt of money in trust, but pleaded that they had invested it on personal security (Vigrass v. Bintfiel, 3 Madd. 62; Mforrissey v. Foley, 2 Molloy, 346); such a mode of invest- ment being illegal (Willes v. Steward,.Coop. . C 6); but under the Code, the proper proceeding in such cases would be to move for sa isfaction of a part of the plain- tiff's claim. (See ante, p. 319.) By the express terms of the Code, this order may be,325
In what cases. At what stage of the action. made upon the admission of a party, whether made in his pleading or in the course of his examination, and such was the practice in equity. By "examination," the Code undoubtedly refers to the examination of a party as a witness at or before the trial; but whether the order could be granted on affidavits alone, treating them as an examination, is doubtful. Lord ELnTo granted the order in a case of gross fraud, though the defendant had not pleaded nor been examined, upon admissions in his afl- davit presented in opposition to the motion (Jervis v. Whlite, G Ves. 738); but, in doing so, Lord ELDON inti- mated that he could not have granted the order if the defendant had made no affidavit, and the case had not disclosed gross fraud.,Where a party admits possession of a find belonging to another party, but' alleges that there are unsettled claims against it for the payment of which he is personally liable, he may be required to pay over the amount to the latter party; but it is a proper case for requiring security from the party receiving the fund. (Roberts v. Law, 4 Sands. 642.) ART. 3.-A.t what stage of the action application may be,gnade. It is in effect impracticable to apply for this order until after issue is joined, except in the rare case of the motion being founded upon admissions in the complaint. For a party cannot be examined as a witness until issue has been joined (see post, char xc.), and the motion must be founded on admissions in the pleadings or examination of parties. The case of Jervis v. White, noticed above, is a solitary exception to this rule, and, for the reasons before stated, cannot be safely followed in practice.,The order may be made at any stage of the proceed- ings subsequent to issue. It has been made after judg- 326
Who may apply for tite order. Mode of application. mlent has been ordered, subject to an accounting. (See wood v. Downes, 1 Ves. & B. 49.),ART. 4.-Who may apply for the order. There is nothing in Â§ 244 of the Code, nor in the former practice, to prevent either party from applying for this remedy in the proper cases, though the plaintiff is alnost always the applicant. An instance is reported in which the defendant obtained permission to pay money into court. (Merritt v. Tlhomplson, 1 Abb. 223; 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 10 How. 428.) It is a general rule, that the party applying for an order to compel another party to deliver up a fund, must either be exclusively entitled to it, or have suce an inter- est jointly with others, in the whole fund, as to entitle him to move on their behalf as well as his own, to have it secured by the court. (Freeman v. Fairlie, 3 Meriv. 29.) Though the court cannot order a person, not a party to the action, to surrender any property under this proceed- ing (Jothson v. Chilpendale, 2 Sim. 55), a stranger to the action may obtain leave to pay money into court to the credit of either party (Francis v. Collier, 5 Madd. 75), but it seems that he should procure one of the parties to make a motion for the purpose. (See ib.),ART. 5.-Mode of application. Whlere to apply.]-This is an application that must be made to the court. (Code, Â§ 244.) No power is conferred upon a judge out of court to grant the order, except in the first district. The motion must of course be made at a special term. Papers on a;pplication.]-The only papers necessary in ordinary eases are the pleadings or examination in which the admission is made. But if any computation is re- quired to determine the amount covered by the admission, such computation must be stated by affidavit. (See Wood,327
Mode of application. Notice of motion. The order v. Downes, 1 Ves. & B. 49; Quarrell v. Beckford, 14 Ve 177.),The notice may be as follows:,Â§ 250. Notice of motion for deposit. [Title of cause.],PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that on the pleadings [and examination of the defendant] in this action, the plaintiff will move [&c.] that the defendant] be required to deposit ........... with the court, the same being admitted by him to be due to the ........... and to be in his possession; and for [&ec.],As a general rule, no papers are used upon the motion that have not been served upon the adverse party before the notice is given, and if so, no new copies need be served upon him. (See ante, i. 418.) AnT. 6.-The order; discretion and pouwers of the court,relative thereto. Discretion of the court.]-The court may exercise a sound discretion in granting or refusing the order, though an appeal may be taken from its decision. Ou appeal, the general term will not, it seems, review the decision of the special term upon the question of security. (See Merritt v. Tholmpson, 1 Abb. 223; 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 10 How. 428.),The order.]-The order, if granted, may direct the money or property to be deposited in court, or delivered to the applicant, upon or without security, subject to the further direction of the court. (Code, Â§ 244.) It mayfix a day for compliance, but if no time is specified, the party required to make the deposit will have twenty days within which to obey. (Rtle 57, Supreme Ct.),The court will not order interest to be paid in on a sou admitted to be due, but will only require payment of the principal sum (Wood v. Dow nes, 1 Ves. & B. 49); unles 328

Enforcement and effect of the order. the party against whom the order is granted admits hav- ing received interest, in which case it may, so far as he has actually received it, be regarded as part of the princi- pal (Freeman v. Fairlie, 3 Meriv. 29; S. C. cited 1 Ves. & B. 49), but even then, the court will be careful to confine the amount of interest ordered to be paid within the amount admitted by the party concerned. (lb.) The form of the order may be as follows:,Â§ 251. Orderfor deposit in court. .[Title of cause.],On reading and filing noticj of motion, and the answer [or, exanlination] of the [defendant], whereby he admits that the sum [or, property] hereafter mentioned is due [or, belongs to] the [plaintiff]; and on motion of [&e.] OliDERn, that the [defendant] pay [or, deliver] to the clerk of this court [or, tile chamberlain of the city and county of New York, or, the treasurer of the county of ............, or, the plaintiff, upon his giving security CeC., as the court mayy direct], within ........ days after service of this order, the umn of ...... .... dollars [or otherwise,] subject to the fuirtller order of this court. It will be advisable to serve a certified copy of this order on the adverse party personally, as well as upon his attorney in the usual manner. By rule 81 of the Supreme Court all moneys paid into court are to be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the action is triable, unless the court otherwise direct.,ART. 7.-Enforcement and effect of the order. How elnforced.]-Upon proof of personal service of a certified copy of the order, the court can punish disobedi- ence as a contempt (Code, Â§ 244), and may also direct the sheriff to take the money or property ordered to be deli- vered up, and to deliver or convey it to the person named in the order. (Ib.),42,329
Deposit in court. When allowed Effect of paying money, &c., into coturt.]-Any pa bbriging money into court, pursuant to an order of the court, is thereby discharged from all further liability, to the extent of the money as paid in.

As the Code makes no provision concerning discon. tinuance, the legislature having failed to enact that por- tion of the codifiers' report which related to the subject (Seaboard & loajnoke R. 1.. Co. v. White, 1 Abb. 49; 18 Barb. 598), the former practice remains in force. (Averil v. Patterson, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 500; 10 How. 85.),Under the former practice at law, the plaintiff could discontinue as a matter of course at any time before trial or writ of inquiry, upon payment of costs, without apply- ing to the court; and in other cases, upon due application (1 Burr. Pr. 383), and the rule was substantially the same in equity, except that a motion was always necessary. 330,DISCONTINUANCE.
When allowed. Actions for clhattels. (Sea Insurance Co. v. Day, 9 Paige, 249; see Dixon v. Parks, 1 Ves. jr. 402; Anon., id. 140.) The rule is the same now in both legal and equitable actions, and except for special reasons mnaking it nljust to the defendant, the plaintiff may discontinue in any action. (Cooke v. Beach, 25 How. 356.),Tfho may discontinte.]--An action commenced by any person as a public officer (e. g., an overseer of the pool), cannot be discontinued by him after he has yielded his office to a successor, although the record shows no change. (Wright v. Smith, 13 Barb. 414.) 7Und1er stay of proceedings.]-An order of discontinuance cannot be obtained while the plaintiff's proceedings are stayed. (Muirray v. Silver, 1 New Pr. Cas. 256.) When counterclaim is interlposed.]-Tlie plaintiff's right to discontinue is not affected by the fact of the defendant having set up a counterclaim (Seaboard and loanoke Co. R. B. v. Ward, 1 Abb. 46; 18 Barb. 595; Oai7stlith v. Sutlherland, 4 Abb. 15; 1 Hilt. 265; Bees v. Patten, sp. t., 13 How. 258); unless the time for replying has been allowed to expire, so tha t the counterclaim stands admit- ted of record (Cockle v. Uulnerwood, 3 Duer, 676; 1 Abb. 1), or unless the counterclail would, in a new action, be barred by the statute of limitations (Van Akle v. Scher- lerhlorn, sp. t., 14 How. 287; see Rees v. Patten, sp. t., 13 How. 258); in wllich cases a discontinuance is not allowed, except upon terms which secure justice to the defendant. Action for chattels.]-It was held, in one case, that the plaintiff could not discontinue an action for chattels, after having obtained possession of the goods by requisi- tion (Wilson v. Wheeler, sp. t., 6 How. 49); but this deci- sion was rendered with evident hesitation, and has been since disapproved at general term (Seaboard & Boawnohe B. R. Co. v. Ward, 1 Abb. 46; 18 Barb. 595), such dis-,331
------ continuance not appearing to prejudice any substantial right of the defendant, who may obtain a return of the goods. (Ib.),After trial or ilnqiry.]--Discontinuance is never al- lowcd (except by consent of parties), after a general verdict (Goodeough1 v. Beetles, 2 Cromp. M. & R. 240; 3 Dowl. P. C. 751; Price v. Parker, 1 Salk. 178); nor after a writ of inquiry has been executed (Stephens v. Etterict, 1 Show. 63; Carth. 86); nor after judgment has been ordered against the plaintiff on demurrer (Turner v. Turner, 2 Ld. Raym. 856; 1 Salk. 179); nor after the defendant has moved to dismiss the complaint. (Loce v. Peacock, Barnes, 316.) But, on motion, the plaintiff may sometimes, as a special favor, be allowed to discontinue after a special verdict (see Price v. Parker, 1 Salk. 178; Boucher v. Laison, Ca. t. Hardw. 200), though not for the purpose of obtaining fresh proof to contradict the verdict. (Roe v. Gray, 2 Wmi. Blacks. 815.),1TVJeen application is made to avoid costs.]-VWhen the plaintiff desires to obtain an order for discontinuance without costs (as to which, sec clap. civ.), he must ap- ply promptly after information of the facts which induce him to discontinue, otherwise partial costs at least will be imposed upon him. (St. John v. Hart, sp. t., 16 How. 192; Merritt ads. Arden, 1 Wend. 91; Ludlow v. Hackett, 18 Johns. 252.),After commencelment of new action.]-lWhere the pen- dency of a former action is pleaded as a defense, the plaintiff may discontinue such action, and thereby defeat the answer in the new action. (Bca7s v. Caameron, sp. t., 3 How. 414; lMarston v. Lawrence, 1 Johns. Cas. 397; see Averill v. Patterson, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 500; 10 How. 85.) But as such discontinuance was always required to be alleged in a reply, when such replies were allowed (see 332,DISCONTINUANCE.
Wlhen allowed. Hlow effected. ib.), it has been held that now, when replies to merely defensive matter are not allowed, such discontinuance must be effected before notice of trial (Swart v. Borst, sp. t., 17 How. 71), which must, we think, mean a notice given by the plaintiff. And it seems to us that the discontinuance should be eftected within twenty days after service of the answer. It cannot'be allowed upon the trial of the new action, the defense of a former action pendingl having been duly interposed (Bedell v. Powell, 13 Barb. 183), unless, we presume, it might be upon paymlent of costs in both actions up to that time.,AnT. 2.-Discontiuance, how eftected. Order lecess(ary.]-An action cannot be discontinued by a mere notice. An order of the court is illispensable. (Arerill v. Pattersol, 10 N.Y. [6 Scld.] 500; 10 Ilow. 85.) Where, however, an order has been nlade, granting leave to the plaintiff to discontinue, if lie shall so elect, upon service of notice to that effect, the service of such notice works a colmplete discontinuance, without further order. (Ferry v. Bank of Central Y. Y., sp. t., 9 Abb. 100.) Howa obtainedI.]-Under the old practice at law, the plaintiff coul(, in the proper cases, enter an order for dis- continuance upon payment of costs in the comnlon rule book, without any actualall pplication to the court. (1 Burr. Pr. 383.) But there was not in equity, nor is there now in any court, a colmmon rule book (see Bedell v. lowell, 13 Barb. 185), and the course of practice is not perfectly clear. We think, however, that the plaintiff may apply for the order without notice, in any case in which hle might formerly have entered it of course. Such appears to have been tle course adopted in a reported case (Seaboard and loaoke R. 1R. Co. v. Ward, 1 Abb. 40; 13 Barb. 595); such was the practice in equity (see Cummlins v. Bennett, 8 Paige, 81), and it has been recently approved. (Coolie v. Beach, 25 How. 356.),333

Pennett, 8 Paige, 81), he ilust apply to the court upon the usual notice.,Though, in general, any action may be discontinued by order entered upon the consent of the parties, the New York Superior Court has intimated very strongly that it would not pernmit an action for the dissolution of a part- nerstip and settlement of its debts to be discontinued, without notice to the creditors, though not parties. (Rut- ter v. Tallis, 5 Sands. 612.),3Mori.gl pal(pers.]-On an application for leave to discon. tinlue uponl payiment of costs, before the trial, no papers are necessary, as unless the defendant slows some special reason to the contrary, the order will be granted asa matter of course.,But if the plaintiff desires to discontinue after the trial, or without costs, lie must apply upon affildavits showing grounds for such a favor. (See Fifield v. Brown, 2 Cow. 503.),Costs.]-As to the costs upon discontinuance, and the cases in which they are allowed or disallowed, see post, chap. civ, art.,Proceedings aunder order.]-An order of discontinuance has no effect until served upon the defendant's attorney (Iall v. Lindo, sp. t., 8 Abb. 341), and until this is done, he may proceed in tle action, and will be entitled to the costs of any proceedilngs taken by him before service of the order, though after it was actually granted. (Hall v. Lindo, sp. t., 8 Abb. 341.),And if the order is conditioned upon the payment of costs, or (the defendant having appeared) says nothing about the costs, as was usually the case under the old practice, it is of no effect until all costs of the action are 334

Acl;er, sp. t., 7 Abb. 30S.),ART. 4.-Defelndant's proceedings on discontinlmance. The Revised Statutes enacted that whenever a plain- tiff discontinuedl an action in which, had he recovered, he would have been entitled to costs, the lefendanlt slould have ju(dgmtrent for full costs. (2 RI. S. 615, Â§ 16.) This section of the statute does not appear to be repealed by the Code (see Bartle v. Gilman, 18 N. Y. 260); though it is left out of the fourth and fifth editions of the Rlevised Statutes. Nevertheless, it is held that the defendant cannot enter up judgment for his costs as of course, ulpon their non-pay- ment. (fiicks v. Brennan, sp. t., 10 Abb. 304; Hluntington v. Forklson, 7 Hill, 195.) But lie may treat the action as continuing until his costs are paid, and may proceed as though no effort had been made to discontinue it. (Ib.; James v. Delavanl, 7 Wend. 511.) In an action for chattels, if the plaintiff has obtained possession of the goods under a requisition upon the sheriff, the defendant is entitled, upon discontinuance of the action, to judgment for a return of the goods, in the same manner as if he had obtained a verdict. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 847; [2 id. 531]; see Seaboard and Roanoke R. 1?. Co. v. Ward, 1 Abb. 46; 18 Barb. 595.) In an action against a foreign corporation, if property have been at-,335

AlpT. 1.--In Uwhat cases thLe complaint naty be dismissed. The court may disnmiss the complaint, with costs, in favor of one or more defendants, in case of unreasonable neglect on the part of the plaintiff to serve the summons on other defendants, or to proceed in the action against the defendants served. (Code, Â§ 274.),WThat is tunlreasonable neglect to proceed(.]--We have already treated of one case of neglect to proceed, viz., neglect to serve the complaint in due time after demand. (Ante, p. 246.),Tlhe Code itself specifies a neglect to serve the sum- monls on other defendants as equivalent to a neglect to proceed. But this is to be understood as applying only to defendants named in tile complaint. The summons may contain the names of several defendants, and the complaint omit some of them, in which case the defendll ants served cannot move to dismiss the complaint for 336
Iu what cases. Unreasonable neglect to proceed. neglect to serve the suimmons on other defendants who are not named in the complaint. (Travis v. Tobias, sp. t., 7 lvow. 90; see Robinsont v. Frost, 14 Barb. 536.) When an issue of fact has been joined in any action, and the plaintiff therein fails to bring it to trial according to the course and practice of the court, the defenldant may move to dismiss tile conmplai:_t with costs. (Rule 27, Slpreme Court.*) The plaintiff fails to bring the cause properly to trial, within the meaning of this rule, when younger issues have been tried at a term for which the action might have been noticed. (Roy v. Tho)mpson, 1 Duer, 636; 8 How. 253.) The plaintiff need not notice the cause for trial until the defendant's time for amending his answer las elapsed (CussoJt v. 1Whalo , sp. t., 5 lHow. 305; see Wlasfhb ri, v. HIerricl, sp. t., 4 How. 15); an1d 10o neglect can be im- pated to hinm by reason of his not doing so before that time. (Cutsson v. TWlalon, suipr.) If an order for a new trial has been obtained by the defendant, lie cannot move to dismiss the complaint for want of notice of trial, until lie has served a copy of the order on the plaintiff, and the ]atter has failed afterwards to notice the cause in due time (Robb v. Jewell, sp. t., 6 How. 276; Jackson, v. V7ilson, 9 Johns. 265); but if a new trial is ordered on the plaintiff's application, lie is bound to proc(((ed without notice from the defendant. (J;csonl v. Johnson, 7 Cow. 419.) If the parties agree to set down a cause for a specified day, and the circuit adjourns before that day, the defend- ant has no ground for moving to dismiss tile complaint for want of trial at tllat circuit, even though it should appear that the plaintiff might have tried the cause before *Sc&irolder v. Kliolenbadc7, (sp. t., 6 Ahb. 66); Ifoe7ler v. Bailey, (sp. t., 14 0owv 359); are superseded by this rule. (Bowles v. Vacn Horne, sp. t., 11 Abb.84; 19 How. 340.),43,337
In what cases. Unreasonable neglect to proceed. the agreement was entered into, the agreement waiving such an objection (lller v. Swceet, sp. t., 9 How. 74); unless tile arrangement is mLade specially for the accom- modation of the plaintiff, in which case he must assumo the risk of a failure to reach the cause. (Root v. --- 4 Htill, 38.),The fiact that the defendant has noticed the cause for trial, and might have brought it on, does not relieve the plaintiff from the imputation of neglect, if he fails duly to bring it to trial. (Bowcles v. VanT Homre, sp. t., 11 Abb. 84; 19 How. 346; overlruling Mloellor v. 1ktiletj, sp. t., 14 -Iow. 3~59; Tltompson v. Krider, sp. t., 8 How. 248; 31'Carthy v. HaIcoc1k, sp. t., 6 How. 28.),The complaint will not be dismissed for a failure to try the cause, if it appears that the jnudge refused to try it (Hart v. Ilihlreth, 2 Cow. 511; JIe)ikiA v. Gluerss,.12 East 247; 2 Camn. 408); nor where the cause being tried, the jury f:il to agree, and the plaintiff' refises to try it agÂ§ain at that circuit (Pisier v. Dal1, 17 Johns. 342), nor if, the pllaintiff having challenged the array, and the judge having erroneously overruled the challenge, instead of ;appointilg triels, tle plaintiff reflsed to proceed with the trial (Gardner v. iTurneir, 9 Johns. 260), nor where, on the cause being called, the plaintiff beilg ready, and the defendant absent, tleo judge ordlxle the cause to be passed witlout prejtuice to the former, and it was not again called. (Pier v. P'age, sl). t., 1 How. 40.),A motion to dismiss for not proceeding to trial will be denied with costs, where the plaintiff's tfilure to do so has been caused by the defendant's secreting a witness (Cole v. lWright, sp. t., 1 How. 132; Smithi ads. Grover, 1 Wend. 77), or where the plaintiffls proceedings have been stayed by an oxler to show cause, ant meanwhile the time for noticing the cause passed (Mills v. Chtl)ma7nn, sp. t., 1 How. 102), or where the action was settled before the circuit, although no order of discontinuance is entered (XlUltb v 338
In what cases. Unreasonable neglect to proceed. Greenwcood, sp. t., 1 How. 32; M31rritt v. Seacord, sp. t., idL 95), provided that, if such settlement is made between the parties in person, the defendant's attorney was duly notified of such settlement. (See Pilyer v. Gore, sp. t., 12 Abb. 244.) And so where the parties (harris v. En sig,, sp. t., 1 How. 103), or their attorneys (Brown v. V.Tddr, sp. t., 2 How. 71), even without the consent of the defendant personally (Stinnard v. Ael' York Fire Ins. Co., sp. t., 1 How. 169), enter into any agreement which either ex- pressly or by necessary implication prevents the plaintiff from proceeding. So also, where the cause was submitted to arbitration previous to tlhe circuit (Bradt v. Way, 2 Caines, 9'i), or where the parties agreed before the circuit to such submission, though tile agreement was only verbal. (Irtll v. Miller, sp. t., 1 How. 184.) If tile plaintiff, being ordered to file security for costs, neglects to do so within the time prescribed by the order, the ,fendant may, notwithstandingl the plaintiff's proceed- ings are stayed by order of tle court, move to'dismiss the complaint for want of progress in the action. (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495; Glover v. Cuming, 12 Wend. 295; Chamnillin v. Petrie, 4 Srend. 209.) An omission to bring in the representatives of a deceased defendant, when necessary, is good ground for moviig to dismiss the complaint, as the action cannot proceed without them. The court will, however, allow a reasonable time for bringing them in. (See Chapman v. Foster, sp. t., 15 How. 241.) The same course may be adopted, where a plaintiff has died, and his representa- tives fail to ievive tile action. (See Williamrson v. Moore, 5 Sands. 649.) And on a motion of this kind, it is no sufficient answer to show that the plaintiff is dead, and has no legal representative, but that his attorney holes to get one appointed.

But if no special term is held in the district between the circuit and the general term, or if there is not suficient tilme to notice the motion for suchll a term, the delflndant may move at any special term before the second ensuing g"eneral term. (Lyon v. IIofftn(, 10 Wend. 576; see .IIaw- ley v.

It must state that a circuit or term has been held, for which the cause might have been noticed (Griffith v. iMiller, 7 Wend. 514; Anon., 6 Cow. 388; see Johnston v. Daris, sp. t., 1 How. 239), for the court will not take judicial notice of the fact. (Anon., 6 Cow. 388.),If the cause is triable in the city of New York, it is also necessary to state that younger issues hanve been tried (Roy v. Thompson, 1 Duer, 6i36; 8 How. 2. RIlssell v. Barnes, 13 Johns. 156), and tlat the cause ight have been tried in its order on the calendar (Russe!l v. Barnes, supra; see Griffith v. Miller, 7 Wend. 514; ]Weed v. Ellis, 1 Caines, 115); but in country causes this allegation is unnecessary. (Griffith v. Miller, 7 Wend. 514.) It is not necessary to state that the cause has not been tried. (Borst v. Bovee, sp. t., 1 How. 63.) When the cause has been noticed, but not tried, it is not necessary to state that issue has been joined, as that is ilmplied in the allegation of notice of trial (Corby) v. Heywlor th, 5 Scott, 235; 6 Dowl. P. C. 181), but the affi- davit must state the place of trial (Jolhston v. Davis, sp. t., 1 How. 23!); the notice of trial (ib.); that the circuit for which it was noticed was held (ib.); and tlat the cause was not tried (M3ather v. WIardwell, sp. t., 1 How. 61; Jack7so v.

Moore, 3 Hill, 447); but if the cause has been noticed for trial, the affidavit of the defendant's counsel, who attended the circuit, though not his attorney of record, is sufficient. (Bird v.

Troodwlorth, 3 Caines, 136), unless a sufficient excuse for so doing is stated therein. (See Chase v. Edwards, supra.) No doubt the sickness or absence of the attorney, or the fact that the clerk managed the business, and was personally acquaint- ed with more of the facts stated than the attorney, would be sufficient excuse.,An affidavit by the defendant himself has been held good, though he appears in the cause by attorney (Ames v. Mcrrimsan, 9 Wend. 498); but it probably appeared in that case that the cause was noticed for trial, and tlat the defendant attended the circuit without his attor- ney, and so was better able than the attorney to prove what took place at the circuit.

When the plaintiff has neglected to bring his cause to trial according to the practice of the court, and the same has not been noticed by the defendant, he may tender a stipulation, and offer to pay the costs to which the defend- ant is entitled up that time. (Rule 26, Supremne Ct.),This stipulation must be for a trial at the next circuit or trial term, and may be in the following form:,Â§ 254. Stipulationt to try at the elext circuit. [Title of cause.] It is hereby stipulated on the part of the plaintiff, that this cause shall be brought to trial at the [circuit court] appointed to be held at ............ on the .... day of ........ next. [Date.] [Signature.] This stipulation should be indorsed with an offer as follows:,255. Offer to lay costs. Please to take notice, that tle plaintiff tenders the within stipu- lation, and offers to pay the defendant's costs up to this time. [Adlress.] [Signastu'e.] The stipulation and offer must be served on the defend- ant's attorney, not on his counsel merely. (Shattuck v. Chaniberlin, 4 Cow. 14.) If the defendant accepts the offer, which it is almost

Opposing the motion. invariably advisable for him to do, he should give notice of his acceptance, withdraw his motion, tax the costs on notice, and demand them from the plaintiff. If not paid on demand, he may renew the application for a dismissal of the complaint. (See Chadderton v. Backus, 6 Wend. 521; Howard v. McKlight, 25 id. 688.),The costs to be paid include all that have accrued in the action, but none upon the motion. And if after this offer, the defendant persists in his motion, it will be denied, unless some special reason appears for applying to the court. (Baldcwin v. Tillson, sp. t., 1 How. 173; see Howard v. iMcKnight, 25 Wend. 688; Jackson v. Hooker, 3 Cow. 15.),ART. 4.-Opposing th7e motion. The plaintiff may oppose the motion on the ground of strict right, or he may excuse his apparent neglect in such manner as to mitigate the terms of the order.,In the former case, the moving papers should be examined, and if they are defective, that objection should be raised at the outset.,If the papers are sufficient in form yet the entire facts may not constitute a case for granting the order within the rules previously laid down, (ante, pp. 136-339.) Thus while as before mentioned, the defendant in a country cause, moving for dismissal on account of fail ure to notice or try the cause, need not state in his affidavit that any cause of a later issue has been tried, yet the plaintiff may prove in opposition that no cause of as late an issue has been tried, and this will be a complete answer to the motion. (Crosby v. Taylor, sp. t., 2 How. 72; Hawck v. Taylor, 10 Wend. 592; see Griffith v. Miller, 7 Wend. 514.),Bad faith on the part of the defendant or his attorney is a good ground of opposition (Russell v. Ball, 1 Caines, 252), and as before stated (ante, p. 339), a motion made in violation of an agreement between the parties or their attorneys will be denied, with costs. 344
Opposing motion. Excuse for delay. Excuse to an Aid stipulation. Excztse for not bringing cause to trial.]-If the plaintiff cannot successfully oppose on the ground of strict right, he may, nevertheless, excuse his default and prevent his complaint from being absolutely dismissed.,Some excuse is necessary, however slight, and a mere stipulation is not sufficient without any excuse (Alic7oll v. Collinlgwood, 2 Dowl. P. C. 60), but a stipulation and offer of costs, under the rules of the Supreme Court, are probably sufficient without any excuse, if tendered before the motion is brought to a hearing: certainly they are sufficient if tendered before the motion is noticed. In case such tender has not been made before the hearing of the motion, the plaintiff is bound to show that his neglect has not been unreasonable, or the complaint must be absolutely dismissed. (Rule 27, Supreme Ct.) Excuse to avoid stipulation.]-A substantial excuse must be given if the plaintiff desires to avoid stipulating for trial at the next circuit; but an excuse, which will not relieve from costs, may be sufficient to obviate the neces- sity of stipulation. (Brooks v. Hunt, 3 Caines, 94; Russell v. Ball, 1 id. 252.) The plaintiff has been excused from stipulating (though required to pay costs), where he was prevented from pro- ceeding to trial by the absence of a material witness, who had been duly subpoenaed (Marselis v. Clopper, 2 Johns. 480; Jackson v. Mann, 2 Caines, 92), or whom he had used his best efforts to subpcena (see Morse v. M'PCy, 4 Cow. 551), but the mere absence of a witness, when it is not shown that the plaintiff used diligence in procuring his attendance, is not enough to avoid the necessity of stipulating. (Taylor ads. How, 1 Wend. 34; see Deas v. Smith, 1 Caines, 171.) The sudden indisposition of the attorney and counsel for tile plaintiff, at a period too late for him to employ other counsel for the circuit, is a sufficient excuse to dis- pense with a stipulation, but not with the costs of the,44,345
Opposing motion. Excuse to avoid stipulation and costs circuit (Jac7cson v. Brown, 1 Caines, 152), and nothing but sickness or an equally unavoidable cause is an excuse sufficient for the purpose. (Jackson v. Wakenirn, 2 Cow. 578.),An unexpected defect of testimony is a sufficient excuse for this purpose. (Case v. Belknap, 5 Cow. 422; see 1aytns v. Spiicer, 7 T. R. 178; Jackson v. Haight, 2 Caines, 93.),Excuse to avoid costs.]-In some cases, the plaintiff will be allowed to stipulate without paying costs, but these cases are rare, the rule being rather the other way. (See Brooks v. Hunt, 3 Caines, 94.),Ihus, where the plaintiff's attorney has caused the delay complained of by a mistake in practice, on a point on which he was misled by erroneous reported decisions, no costs will be imposed (Patrick v. Hallett, 2 Caines, 378), but a mere mistake, not founded upon any authority, will n t avoid costs. (Sihefield v. Watson, 1 Caines, 22.),Excuse to avoid stipulation and costs.]-There are cases in which the court will entirely absolve the plaintiff, although technically he is in default.,It seems to be a general rule that he cannot be com- pelled to proceed when the defendant has rendered it useless for him to do so. (See Jackson v. Webb, 1 Caines, 116.),If, during the pendency of the action, the defendant has been discharged from his debts as a bankrupt or in- solvent (Lee v. Phillips, 6 Hill, 246; Park v. Moore, 4 Hill, 592; Merritt v. Arden, 1 Wend. 91); or has been dis- charged from imprisonment by proceedings in insolvency (Honeywell v. Burns, 8 Cow. 121; Ludlow v. Hackett, 18 Johns. 252; Ashworth v. Wrigley, 1 Hall, 145; Hart v. Storey, 1 Johns. 143); or has been sentenced to the state prison (Fort v. Palmerton, 19 Wend. 94; Lackey v. I2Donald, 1 Caines, 116); the motion to dismiss will be denied, and the plaintiff will be allowed to discontinue 346
Opposing motion. Excuses. Order dismissing complaint. without costs. And the 'same course will be adopted, even where the discharge was granted before the com- mencement of the action, provided it is clearly shown that the plaintiff had no information of it. (Smith v. Skinner, sp. t., 1 How. 122.) But the motion cannot be resisted upon any other evi- dence of the defendant's poverty than his actual discharge under a statute (M'Glade v. Whzaton, 1 Wehd. 34; Collins Ecans, 6 Johns. 333; Case v. BellzMwp, 5 Cow. 422), or a decree for such discharge. (Park v. Moore, 4 Hill, 592.) Where several actions are brought on for trial at a cir- cuit, all depending on one question, and the defendant has a verdict in one of them, upon which the plaintiff makes a case and notifies the defendant's counsel of his intention to await the result of that case before proceed- ing with the others, a motion to dismiss for not proceeding will be denied. (Ogden v. Beers, sp. t., 1 How. 69; Sherman v. M'Nitt, 2 Cow. 452; but see contra, Jaccson v. Leggett, 5 Wend. 83; Brant v. Fowler, 2 Wend. 284.),ART. 5.-The order. The order, if granted, may be for an absolute dismissal, or conditional. Unless the plaintiff is grossly at fault, it is rarely made absolute on the first application. On a motion to dismiss for not proceeding to trial, if the plaintiff is allowed to stipulate and pay costs, the costs must be all that have accrued up to that time. (Bowles v. Van Horne, sp. t., 11 Abb. 84; 19 How. 3t6.) The form of the order may be as follows:,Â§ 256. Order disnissing complaint. [Title of cause.] [Caption.] On reading and filing [&c.] and on motion of [&c.] ORDERED: That the complaint herein be dismissed, with costs, and ........ dollars, costs of motion [unless the plaintiff, within ;...... days after service of a copy of this order, stipulates for trial,347

(Rule 57, Supreme Ct.) For the form of stipulation, see Â§ 254, ante, p. 343.,If the plaint'ff fails to stipulate when required, judg- ment may be entered against him, but the costs must be taxed and actually demanded of him before entering judgment. (See Hoicard v. McKlightt, 25 Wend. 688; Jackson v. Hooker, 3 Cow. 15.),Jud.qgmcnt.]-If the order is absolute, judgment maybe entered at once dismissing the complaint. If it is con- ditional, as where the plaintiff is allowed to stipulate and pay costs, the costs must be taxed on notice (for the manner of proceeding, see post, chap. cvi.), and payment demanded before taking any further steps (see Howard v. MlcKlnig7t, 25 Wend. 688; Jackcson v. Hooker, 3 Cow. 15), but it is the plaintiff's duty to serve the stipulation, with- out waiting for a demand, and to offer to pay the costs upon adjustment. (Ante, i. 430.),If the costs are not paid on a demand made at least fifteen days after taxation, and the stipulation is not served within twenty days after the order (no other time being specified therein), the defendant may, on filing an affidavit of the facts, enter judgment. (1 Burr. Pr. 421.) And the same course may, we presume, be adopted in the case of any other conditional order of the kind. Unless otherwise directed by the order, the time runs from the 348

For the form of judgment, &c., see post, chap. cix.,ART. 7.-Proceedings on default after stipulation. If, after stipulating, the plaintiff fails to bring the cause to trial pursuant to his stipulation, the defendant should again move to dismiss the complaint in the same manner as before. The plaintiff has not an absolute right to stipulate a second time (Farnamil v. McClure, 7 Wend. 483), unless the stipulation has been fulfilled (Baldwin v. Tillson, sp. t,, 1 How. 173), as where the cause was tried under a stipulation and a new trial ordered. In such a case, it wis held that the plaintiff could stipulate anew as a matter of course. (Ib.) Upon an actual default after stipulation, the defendant has a right to move for dismissal, and to submit the plain- tiff's excuse to the scrutiny of the court. (Flarnam v. McClure, 7 Wend. 483.) The plaintiff is usually allowed to stipulate a second time on payment of costs, if he gives a substantial excuse for his default (see Bradt v. iMount, sp. t., 1 How. 33; Nixen v. Hallett, 2 Johns. Cas. 218); but the excuse must be substantial. (Jaceson v. Wakeinan, 2 Cow. 578.) A new stipulation has been allowed where the plain- tiff's default was caused by the unavoidable absence of a witness (Gifford v. Babbott, sp. t., 1 How. 64; Osborn v. Van Cort, sp. t., id. 51; Nixen v. Hallett, 2 Johns. Cas. 218); or by a mistake in regard to docu- mentary evidence, the wrong paper having been brought to court (Bradt v. 1Mount, sp. t., 1 How. 33); or by delay in the return of a commission (Seamans v. Tillson, sp. t., 1 low. 19); and where, after stipulation, the defendant was sentenced to state prison, the plaintiff was justified in not proceeding, and allowed to discontinue without costs. (Lackey v. McDonald, 1 Caines, 116.),349
Dismissal of complaint. Absolute stay of proceedings, In a case of prolonged absence of a necessary witness, the plaintiff was allowed to stipulate a third time. (Liv. ingston v. Delafeld, 1 Caines, 6.),ART. 8.-Restoring the cause. The proper method of obtaining a restoration of the cause is by moving to set aside the judgment. This was the practice at common law, and in equity the proceed. ings was substantially the same, so there can be no doubt as to the present practice. (Compare 1 Burr. Pr. 422, and 1 Barb. Ch. Pr., 245.),For the proceedings upon this application, see post, chap. cxiii.,CHAPTER LXXXI. STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.* ARTICLE 1. Absolute stay of proceedings.,2. Conditional stay of proceedings. ART. 1.-Absoltte stay of proceedings. Staying suit on payiment of debt.]-It was a common practice, before the enactment of the statutes concerning payment into court to be made and pleaded, to stay pro- ceedings in actions for the recovery of specific sums of money, upon payment of the debt and costs. (1 Burr. Pr. 409; Gral. Pr. [2d ed.] 546.),And even in other actions, proceedings were stayed, upon the defendant's paying all that the plaintiff could, in any possible aspect of the case, recover (Oshiel v. De Graw, 6 Cow. 63); or, after verdict, upon payment of the verdict and costs. (Hatfield v. Baldwin, 1 Johns. 506.),* The practice in regard, to temporary stay of proceedings, for the pur- pose of making a motion, is stated ante, i. 416. The practice concerning a stay of proceedings on appeal is stated post, chap. cxxiv. This chapter baa no bearing on those subjects. 350
Absolute etay of proceedings. Conditional stay of proceedings. This proceeding is now so rare in our courts, owing to the more liberal provisions of the Code upon the subject of offers by the defendant (see ante, p. 310), that we are content to refer to'the old books of practice for further information on the subject.,Where a suit has been manifestly commenced for the mere purpose of making costs, without giving the defend- ant a fair opportunity to pay the debt, it should be stayed upon prompt payment of the debt, without costs. (Jefferies v. Shelpparl, 3 Barn. & Ald. 696; Macldinltosh v. Ilaydon, By. & Moo. 363.) Thus if an action should be com- menced without any previous demand, immediately upon the maturity of a note, the maker not knowing where to find the holder; or upon a note payable immediately, or "on demand," the maker having no reason to suppose that payment was expected; or directly after the delivery of goods sold; the court should stay proceedings without costs, nponi payment of the simple debt into court; such procecdJiugs being an abuse of judicial process. Stay of execution.]-Where, after judgment against a party, he obtains a discharge in bankruptcy or insolvency, the court may order perpetual stay of execution (Graham v. Pierson, 6 Hill, 247; Huntter v. Schllyler, sp. t., 1 How. 96), but it is a matter of discretion, and was granted in the first case cited, and refused in the other.,AnT. 2.-Conditional stay of proceedings. Until payment of costs of former slit.]-If the plaintiff has previously brought another action against the same defendant for the same cause, in which costs were awarded against him, and not paid, the court will, on motion, stay all proceedings in the action until the costs of the former suit are paid (Edwards v. Ninth Av. R. R., sp. t., 22 How. 444; Kentish v. Tctlham, 6 Hill, 372; Perlins v. Hinrnan, 19 Johns. 237; Ripley v. Benedict, 4 Cow. 19; Exp. Stone, 3 id. 380; Jackson v. Carpenter. id. 22; Cummnins v. Bennett;,351
Conditional stay of proceedings Until payment of costa 8 Paige, 79; Cui7er v. Vanderwerlc, 1 Johns. Cas. 247), unless it appears that the plaintiff's proceedings have not been vexations (Lawrence v. Dickenson, 2 Cow. 580; Davis v. Duffie, sp. t., 3 Abb. 363; see Demarest v. Wyinkoop, 2 Johns. Ch. 461); the motion being founded upon a presumption that they are so. (Ex parte Stone, 3 Cow. 380.),Not only the actual plaintiffs, but all who are privy to the suit under them, are bound to pay the costs of one suit before instituting another for the same cause. (Jack- son v. Edwards, 1 Cow. 138.),It is immaterial whether the former suit was in the same court, or in any other court of this state (Taylor v. Yalder. roort, 9 Wend. 449; Ex parte Stone, 3 Cow. 380; Perkins v. Himnan, 19 Johns. 237), or in a court of the United States, held in and for this state (Jackson v. Carpenter, 3 Cow. 22! but if it was brought in another state or country, the motion should be denied. (Jtlio v. Ingalls, sp. t., 15 Abb. 429.),Under the old practice, a court of law would not stay proceedings on account of the non-payment of costs in a suit in equity for the same cause (Stebbins v. arant, 19 Johns. 196), and a court of equity would not stay pro- ceedings on account of non-payment of the costs in an action at law (Kerr v. Davis, 7 Paige, 53; Denlarest v. Wynicoop, 2 Johns. Ch. 461; Wi'. v. trobson, 2 Ves. & B. 105), unless it was shown that the new action was brought in bad faith, for mere vexation. (Kerr v. Davis, supra.),The same doctrine has been applied under the Code to an action brought for equitable relief, after the dismissal of an action of a strictly legal nature in the same court (Davis v. Dufie, sp. t., 3 Abb. 363); but we think that the only ground upon which the decision can be sustained is the absence of any purpose of vexation in the case.,The addition of some new defendants in the second action does not take the case out of the general rule. 352
Conditional stay. Until payment of costs. (Kentish v. Tatham, 6 Hill, 372.) Nor does it alter the case that, the plaintiff being an infant, his guardian ad lilete in the second action is not the same as in the first (Taylor v. Fandervoort, 9 Wend. 449), nor that the plain- tiff adds a new cause of action in the second suit. (Rip- 1ey v. Benedict, 4 Cow. 19.) An action by the assignee of a plaintiff in a former suit for the same cause, will be stayed until the costs of the former suit are paid. (Richardson v. White, sp. t., 27 How. 455.) But an action for land brought by three plaintiffs, should not be stayed on account of non-payment of costs in an action brought by one of them for his third of the same land. (Ten Broeck v. Reynolds, sp. t., 13 How. 462.) Imprisonment on execution being equivalent to pay- ment, the motion will be denied, if it appears that the plaintiff is in execution for the former costs. (Wyckoff v. Eaton, 4 Wend. 203.) Where tie plaintiff has entered an order in the former suit allowing him to discontinue 'upon payment of costs, which he has not paid, this motion should not be granted, because the former action is still pending, and that fact may be pleaded (Simpson v. Brewster, 9 Paige, 245), but if he has entered an absolute order of discontinuance, with costs against him, the defendant may elect to treat the order as valid, and have a stay in the new suit. (Sax- ton v. Stowell, 11 Paige, 526.) If the defendant has assigned his claim for the costs, without recourse, he is not entitled to this order. (Simp- son v. Brewster, 9 Paige, 245.) The motion may be made at any time before judgment, even after verdict (Jackson v. Miller, 3 Cow. 57), but not after judgment (Fifield v. Brown, 2 Cow. 503); though it may be entertained after judgment, where it has been noticed before, and may be granted simultaneously with an order vacating the judgment as irregular. (Salters v.,lph, 15 Abb. 273.),45,353
Until other proceedings are discontinued. Compelling election.,--- The general proceedings of a party in an action cannot be stayed on account of the non-payment of motion costs in the cause. (Pinney v. Johnson, 2 Wend. 623.),Until other proceedings are d'continued.]-Where a plaintiff prosecutes two or more actions at the same tire, for substantially the same cause, the court in which any of such actions is brought may stay proceedings therein until he discontinues all of such actions but one. (Hanm,'.,.zdv. Baker, 3 Sands. 704.) And though the plaintiff of record in the other suits is not the same as in the action in which the motion is made, yet if they are all under his control, and brought for his benefit, he may be compelled to elect between them. (Mariposa Co. v. Garrison, N. Y. Trans., July 5, 1864; Soule v. Corning, 11 Paige, 412.) But if the plaintiff is the defelnant in another suit, involving the same questions, he cannot be compelled to elect between the two actions. (Mariposa Co. v. Garrison, supra; Botts v. Cozine, 2 Edw. Oh. 583.) 354

A vast amount of learning and research has been bestowed in the old books upon the rule of common law which disqualified witnesses interested in the event of the action. (See Greenleaf on Evidence, %Â§ 386-430.) But under the Code (as in England, since 1851), the whole law on this point is obsolete, it being expressly declared, that no person offered as a witness, can be excluded by reason of his interest in the event of the action. (Code, Q 398.) This broad enactment was originally Qualified by a reservation as to persons for whose immediate benefit the action was prosecuted or defended, but in 1857, this pro- *It is of course our purpose, under this head, merely to state the change ected by the Code upon this subject. For further information, treatises t evidence m-ust be consulted.,355 EVIDENCE.

A party to an action or special proceeding may be examined as a witness on behalf of himself or any other party, in the same manner, and subject to the same rules of examination, as any other witness; except that neither he nor his assignor, if any, can testily against the execu- tors, administrators, heirs, next of kin, or assignees of a deceased person, in respect to any transactions had per- sonally between such deceased person and himself. (Co(e, Â§ 399.),It is almost needless to say that this is a very great change from the former law on this point. Such a reform was warmly recommended by the commissioners of the Code in 1850, and was adopted in England several years before it was ventured upon in this state.,Parties may now be examined, not only adversely, as they might under the Code of 1848 and 1849 (Â§ 390), but also in their own behalf, on the trial, or conditionally, or under proceedings to perpetuate testimony, or on com- mission, in precisely the same cases, and under the same rules, as any other witnesses, with the few exceptions already stated. All decisions to the contrary (and they are too numerous to be mentioned here) are obsolete in this state.,Parties offered as witnesses are subject to the same tests of qualification as any other witnesses (Arnold v. Arnold, 13 Verm. 362, 370; Kitchen v. Tyson, 3 Mar- phey, 314; see Wheelden v. Wilson, 44 Maine, 19); they must be of sound mind and competent age, and have such faith in a future state as is required of other wit- nesses (Arnold v. Arnold, supra); their character for veracity may be attacked in the same manner as that of any other witness (Kitchen v. Tyson, supra), and where their intentions constitute an element of the cause of 356,WITNESSES.

Waller, 25 N. Y. 430; 4 Bosw. 475; MIatt7hews v. Poultney, 33 Barb. 127.),Woio is assignee.]-A mere legatee is not an assignee of the deceased within the meaning of Â§ 399 of the Jode. (Wildey v. Whitney, 25 IHow. 75.),ART. 3.-1Husband and wife. The Code did not, by removing the disability of in- terest, authorize a husband and wife to appear as wit- nesses for or against each other. (Hasbroulc v. Vandervoort, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 153; affirming S. C., 4 Sands. 596; Ma- condray v. Wardle, 7 Abb. 3; 26 Barb. 612; Pillow v. Bushnell, 5 Barb. 156; 4 How. 9.) Nor by authorizing the examination of parties as witnesses, did it make the husband or wife of a party a competent witness. (White v. Stafford, 38 Barb. 419; Macondray v. Wardle, supra; Pillow v. Bushnell, supra; Erwin v. Smaller, 2 Sands. 340; Stapleton v. Crofts, 18 Q. B. 367; Barbat v. Allen, 7 Exch. 609.) But under the amendments of 1857 to Â§ 399 of the Code, a husband and wife may, when both are parties to the action, be examined as witnesses for or against each other. (Shoenulcer v. McKee, 19 How. 86; see Marsh v. Potter, 30 Barb. 506;* see Chamberlain v. People, 23 N. Y. 85; but see contra, Mount v. Mount, 17 Abb. 4; Bihin v. Bihin, id. 19; Alcock v. AlOock, 5 De Gex & Sm. 671.),In 1860, a clause was added to Â§ 399, excepting com- munications between husband and wife fiom being given in evidence. This clause was held conclusive proof of the intention of the legislature to allow them to testily, when both were parties. (Barton v. Gledhill, 12 Abb. 246; * A new trial being had in this cause, judgment thereon, turning we be- lieve on this point, was affirmed in the Court of Appeals,357 WITNESSES.
Husband and wife. Obtaining admission of genuineneas, see Sc7uffner v. Retter, 37 Barb. 44.) But as this clause was dropped from the section in 1862, the rule must stand upon the earlier decisions.,By rule 88 of the Supreme Court, the testimony of the plaintiff is admissible in actions for a limited divorce, as to acts of cruelty which took place where no competent witness was present. Under the decisions above cited, there can be no such restriction any longer laid upon the testimony of the plaintiff in such a case. (P. v. P., 24 How. 197, but see Bihin v. Bihint, 17 Abb. 19.),CHAPTER LXXXIV. OBTAINING ADMISSION OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. Either party may exhibit to the other, or to his attorney, at any time before the trial, any paper material to the action, and request an admission in writing of its genu- ineness. If the adverse party or his attorney fails to give the admission, within four days after the request, and if the party exhibiting the paper is afterwards put to expense in order to prove its genuineness, and the same is finally proved or admitted on the trial, such expense, to be ascertained at the trial, must be paid by the party refusing the admission, unless it appears to the satisfac- tion of the court that there were good reasons for such refusal. (Code, Â§ 388.),It is plainly expedient to demand an admission of this kind at least four days before the trial, the adverse party being allowed that space of time for consideration and examination; though if the trial extends over more than four days, a demand made on the first day will suffice.,It may be. well to present to the adverse party an admission for his signature, in the following form: 358
Admission of genuineness. When notice necessary. When not.,Â§ 257. Admission of the genuineness of a document. itle of cause.] The annexed instrument is hereby admitted to be genuine, for all the purposes of this action. If the adverse party refuses to sign such an admission, an affidavit of the expense incurred by such refusal should be prepared and presented to the judge at the trial, who may allow the same to be added to or deducted from the bill of costs, according as the party applying for it is successful on the main issue or not.,CHAPTER LXXXV. NOTICE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS. ARTICLE 1. When necessary or not.,2. Form of notice. 8. Service of notice. 4. Effect of notice. ART. 1.-When necessary or not. When necessary.]-In general, secondary evidence of a document in the possession of the adverse party is inad- missible, without notice to him to produce the original upon the trial. Even the denial by a party that a particular paper ever existed, has been held not to dispense with the necessity for a notice to produce it. (Grimm v. Hamel, 2 Hilt. 434.) But this seems doubtful.,Wlten not.]-If the pleading of a party alleges, directly or by implication, that his adversary is in possession of a specific document, he may prove its contents without giv- ing notice to produce it, the pleading being considered sus- ficient notice. (Forward v. Harris, 30 Barb. 338; Edwards,359

Kretsinger, 17 id. 293; People v. Holbrook, 13 id. 90.),Where a party obtains possession of an instrument by fraud, from a witness subpoenaed by the adverse party to produce it, its contents may be proved by the latter with. out notice to produce. (Leeds v. Cook, 4 Esp. 256.) So where a party snatches at a paper and tears off a part of it, the contents of the part torn off may be proved with- out notice. (Scott v. Pentz, 5 Sands. 572.),A counterpart of an agreement, executed by one party, may be read by the other party without notice to produce the original. (Burleiglb v. Stibbs, 5 T. R. 465.),The contents of any notice upon which the action is founded (Kine v. Beaumont, 3 Brod. & B. 288; Colling v. Treweek, 6 Barn. & Cr. 398), such as a notice of dishonor to an indorser in an action against him (Paton v. Lent, 4 Duer, 231; Scott v. Betts, Hill & D. Supp. 363; Johnson v. Haight, 13 Johns. 470; Swiain v. Lewis, 2 Cr. M. & ,. 261), or a notice to repair in an action to recover a pro- portion of the expense of erecting a division fence put up by the plaintiff after such notice (Willoughby v. Care- ton, 9 Johns. 136), may be proved by parol without notice to produce.,So may the contents of any notice served in the action (Tower v. Wilson, 3 Cai. 174), or in any collateral matter. (McFadden v. Kingsbuvy, 11 Wend. 667; but see Lanauze v. Palmer, Moo. & M. 31.),ART. 2.-Form of notice. The notice must be in writing (Code, Â§ 408), and must dis- tinctly point out the paper required and also state that in default of so producing it, parol evidence of its contents will be given.

Form of notice. Service of notice. One notice enough. him under an execution, a notice to produce all papers relating to the matter in controversy, is sufficient to admit secondary -evidence of the execution (Walden v. Davison, 11 Wend. 65.) A notice to produce "all letters," is insufficient (Jones v. Edweards, M'Olel. & Y. 139; Fraince v. Lucy, Iy. & M. 341'; but a notice to produce all letters written by one party to the other, concerning the matters in suit, is sufficient to let in evidence of any one of such letters (Jairob v. Lee, 2 Moo. & Rob. 33; see Morris v. Hauser, ir. 392); and a notice to produce "all accounts, papers, and writings relating to the matters in question in this case," is sufficient to let in proof of a written account delivered to the adverse party, and admitted by him to be correct. (Rogers v. Custance, 2 Moo. & Rob. 179.) The notice, though entitled in the wrong court, is nevertheless sufficient, if it does not mislead. (Lawrence v. Clark, 14 Mees. & W. 250.),ART. 3.-Service of notice. A copy of the notice must be served on the opposite party or his attorney, as the case may be, within a reason- able time before trial. What is a reasonable time will depend upon circumstances. (Utica Insurance Co. v. Gad- well, 3 Wend. 300; Gormhan v. Gale, 7 Cow. 739.) When the document wanted is in court, or near by, a notice after the trial has commenced is sufficient (see ib.; Dwyer v. Collins, 7 Exch. 639; MPlherson v. Rathbone, 7 Wend. 216; Roe v. Harvey, 4 Burr. 2484; Anon., Anth. N. P. 273); but if they are at a distance, the notice must be given at a time sufficient to enable the attorney to go or send for them, and return, before the cause can possibly come on for trial.

Wade, Anth. N. P. 87); and a notice given for the first trial is sufficient for a new trial. (Hope v. Beadon, 17 Q. B. 509.),ART. 4.-Effect of the notice. When the paper is not produced.]-The only effect of a refusal to produce a paper on notice, is to enable the party giving such notice to give oral evidence of the contents of such paper (Life & Fire Ins. Co. v. Mechanics Fire Ins. Co., 7 Wend. 34; M'Pherson v. Rathbone, id. 216; Jackson v. Woolsey, 11. Johns. 446), and that if such evidence is imperfect, every presumption is against the party refusing to produce. (Ib.) The refusal is not evi- dence of anything in itself. (Cooper v. Gibbons, 3 Camp. 363; Lawson v. Sherwood, 1 Stark. 315.) Perhaps it may be commented upon in the summing up or charge, as suspicious. (See Bate v. Kinssey, 1 Cr. M. & R. 41; com- pare Doe v. Whitehead, 8 Ad. & El. 571.),Of course, before the notice to produce can be made available for any purpose, it must be proved that the docu- ment is under the control of the adverse party.,When the paper is produced.] -It is at the option of the party calling for a paper, after reading it, to put it in evidence or not, as he pleases. If it is not otherwise com- petent evidence for the party producing it, the notice to produce does not make it so. (See Kenny v. Clarkson, 1 Johns. 385; Rumsey v. Lovell, Anth. N. P. 26.),If the paper is one under which the party producing it claims a title or interest, the party calling for it need not prove its execution (see M'Pherson v. Rathbone, 7 Wend. 216), but otherwise he must. 362

The party desiring the order must apply to a judge of the court (or to any officer authorized to act as such out of court, Laws 1833, ch. 187), upon an affidavit setting forth: 1.

He can raise any objections that he may have upon the examination.,ART. 3.-Tle order. If the judge is satisfied that the circumstances of the case require the examination of such witness in order to attain justice between the parties, he must make an order requiring the adverse party to appear before him and,365
The order. Order to attend examination before a judge. attend such examination at a time and place to be speci- sied, such time not to exceed twenty days from the date of the order, and as much shorter as the exigency of the case may require, and the residence of the adverse party or his attorney will allow, in order to afford sufficient opportunity for his attendance. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 673; [2 id. 392].),This order may be in the following form:,Â§ 260. Order to attend examination before a judge. [Title of cause.],On the annexed affidavit of A. B. ORDERED: That John Jones, of ........, be examined before me as a witness conditionally, at ........, on the ...... day of ........ at .... o'clock in the ....noon; and that the ......'s attorney be notified to attend such examination.,[Date.] [tJudge's signature.] A copy of this order and the affidavit should be in- dorsed with a brief notice of the examination, and served on the adverse attorney the same day, if possible, as any delay in serving it would be a good reason for postponing or denying the examination. The original should be shown at the same time.,Instead of the preceding order, however, the judge may, in his discretion, make an order requiring the ad- verse party to show cause, on a day to be named in the order, why such testimony should not be taken before a referee to be appointed by him, and in such order he must direct the time and mode of its service. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 574; Laws 1851, ch. 472.) This order can only be made by a judge in the district where the action is triable, or in a county adjoining the trial county, or if it is triable in New York city, only by a judge in that city. (See Bank of Silver Creek v. Browning, 16 Abb. 272.),This order may be as follows: 366
The order. Showing cause against the order.,Â§ 261. Order to show cause why a referee slwuld not be appointed,to take the examination. [dle of cause.] On the annexed affidavit, let the ........ show cause before me at ........, on ........, why [name of witness] should not be examined conditionally before a referee to be appointed. And let this order be served on the ........'s attorney in the same man- Der within ........ days from date. [Date.] [Judge's signature.] If, under this order, no sufficient cause is shown, the judge must appoint a referee. The order appointing Jin should specify the time and place of the examination, or prescribe a notice of the same.,ART. 4.-Slwwing cause against the order. If the order directs the examination to proceed before the judge in person, the adverse party may show cause against proceeding therein at the time fixed for it to take place (3 I. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392]), by proof that the witness is not about to leave the state, or is not sick or infirm, according to the ground of application, or that the application is made collusively, to avoid the examina- tion of the witness on the trial. (Ib.) Upon such cause being shown, the application must be dismissed. (lb.) If the order is to show cause against the appointment of a referee, cause must be shown at the time appointed in the order (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392]); and it would of course be too late to oppose the examination before the referee. It might be a valid objection to show that the applica- tion had been needlessly delayed, especially if very short notice had been given. (Pirie v. Iron, 8 Bing. 143; 1 Dowl. P. C. 252; 1 Moore & Scott, 223.) Insufficient notice is a valid objection, and if the adverse party ap- pears, he must object specifically on that ground, or he will waive it. (Jackson v. Kent, 7 Cow. 59.)
The examination. Before the Judge.,ART. 5.-Thle examination. Before the judge.]-If no sufficient cause is shown against it, the examination, if ordered to be taken before the judge, must proceed. If the adverse party does not appear, due proof must be made of service of the order and a copy of the affidavit on which it was granted. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392].),The witness must be sworn and examined in the same manner as upon the trial.,Though the judge is required to take the deposition (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392]), he is not obliged to write it down himself, but may depute that labor to any one else, so long as he maintains the supervision of the examination. (Macdonald v. Garrison, 9 Abb. 34; 2 Hilt. 510.),Any answer or declaration of the witness must, when required by either party, be inserted in the deposition. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392].) But it seems that this provision does not authorize a party to put any questions he may choose, and have irrelevant questions and answers inserted. Illegal or irrelevant questions cannot be allowed on such an examination, though answers actually made must be inserted, no matter how frivolous. (Gibson v. Pearsall, 1 E. D. Smith, 90.),When finished, the deposition must be carefully read to the witness, and subscribed by him, must be certified by the judge, and filed with the clerk within ten days thereafter. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392].) The court may order the deposition to be filed nunc pro tune, after the lapse of ten days. (Burdell v. Burdell, 1 Duer, 625; Bank of Silver Creek v. Browning, 16 Abb. 272.*) It cannot be used as evidence, however, until it has been filed. (Jackson v. Hobby, 20 Johns. 357.),* Affirmed in Court of Appeals. 368
The exaulinatin. Compelling attendance of witness. The certificate of the judge may be in the following form:,O 262. Certificate indorsed on deposition. [Ttle of cause.] I certify, that pursuant to an order granted by me on the ...... day of ......... ..., C. D., whose deposition is annexed, attended before me, with the counsel for the respective parties, on the........ day of ..... , at ............, and that after hearing counsel I proceeded to take the deposition of the said C. D., who being duly sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, was examined by the respective parties, and testified as set forth in the deposition annexed, which he sub- scribed in my presence, after the same had been carefully read to him. [Date.] [Judge's signature.] The certificate will be perfectly good, though it omit to state that the deposition was carefully read (Sheldon v. WFood, 2 Bosw. 279),* and perhaps it need not state more than the simple fact that the deposition was taken before the judge. (Ib.) Before a referee.]-The examination may be conducted before a referee in similar manner. As beforementioned, the order appointing a referee should determine whether any, and if so, what notice shall be given to the opposite party, before proceeding with the examination. The referee must perform the duties of a judge in relation to the deposition, taking, certifying and filing the same. (3 . S. (5th ed.) 674; Laws 1851, ch. 472.) Coonpelling atteu7ndale of witness.]-The judge granting the order may compel the attendance of a witness on a conditional examination, by issuing a summons, and enforcing it as hereafter explained. (3 i. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 393].) See on this subject, post, chap. xci.,* Affirmed, Byxbie v. Wood, (24 N. Y. 607.) 47,369
Putting the deposition in evidence. Proof of absence.,-- ART. 6.-Putting the deposition in evidence. When it may be given in evidence.]-The deposition, or a certified copy thereof, may be given in evidence by either party on the trial of the cause, or on the assessment of damages therein by the clerk or sheriff's jury, after it has been satisfactorily proved that the witness is unable to attend such trial or assessment personally, by reason of his death, insanity, sickness, or settled infirmity, or that he has continued absent from the state, so that his attendance could not be compelled by the ordinary pro- cess of law. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 392].),The death of one of the plaintiffs, after a deposition has been taken, does not invalidate it, and if the action is continued by the survivors or representatives, the deposi- tion may be used on the trial in the same manner as in ordinary cases. (Markoe v. Aldrich, 1 Abb. 55.),Proof of absence.]-It is not necessary to prove that the absence of the witness was uninterrupted from the exami- nation to the trial (Marroe v. Aldrich, 1 Abb. 55); it has been held sufficient to show that he is actually absent at the time of trial (ib); but this is too loose a construction of the statute. It should, we think, be shown either that he was continually absent, or that he has been absent ever since the cause was noticed for trial, or else that he was subpoenaed, but left the state afterwards, so that the subpoena could not be enforced. (See Fry v. Bennett, 4 Duer, 252.),The party offering the deposition must prove that he has used due diligence to procure the attendance of the witness at the trial, and particularly that he has made inquiries at his last place of abode, if within the state, in order to subpoena him. (Pettibone v. Derringer, 4 Wash. . C. 219.),If it is proved that the witness was a resident of another state at the time of the examination, and so continued 370
putting deposition in evidence. Preliminary evidence. for some time afterwards, the burden of proof lies upon the opposing party to show that he could have been subpoenaed for the trial. (Niixon v. Palmer, 10 Barb. 175.) Proof that he is a resident in another state, that he has been seen there since the examination, and that he is reported to be there still, is enough. (Donnell v. Walsh, 6 Bosw. 621.) When the witness is a person of unsettled life, and transient residence, slight proof of his absence is sufficient. (See Gucyon v. Lewis, 7 Wend. 26.) Proof of inability to atteln the trial.]-Sickness of the witness, although only temporary, is, if it exists at the time of trial, a sufficient ground for admitting the deposition. It is only an "infirmity" that is required to be "settled." (Clark v. Dibble, 16 Wend. 601.) The party offering the deposition is not bound to wait for the recovery of the witness, even though it would take place before the next circuit. (Ib.) Proof that the witness is old and infirm, and could not endure the journey to court without serious hazard to health, is sufficient. (Jackson v. Perkins, 2 Wend. 316.) But simple proof of extreme old age is not sufficient, as the court will not presume that the witness is infirm. (Tacl;soln v. Bice, 3 Wend. 183.) General rules as to the preliminary evidence.]-Even be- fore the Code, this preliminary evidence could be given by a party to the cause (Harris v. Clark, 1 Seld. Notes, 35), and of course it can be now. The doubt expressed in Nixonl v. Palmer (10 Barb. 175), as to whether the adverse party could rebut such testimony by his oath, is no longer of importance, parties being now freely admissible as witnesses. The preliminary evidence must be of the usual legal nature and not hearsay (Fry v. Bennett, 4 Duer, 252; Robinson v. 3Markis, 2 Ioo. & Rob. 375), unless, perhaps, when no better evidence is obtainable. (Fry v. Bennett, unpra.),371
Effect of the deposition. Suppression of the deposition. ART. 7.-Effect of the deposition and objections thereto. Effect.]-The deposition, when put in evidence, has precisely the same effect as the oral testimony of the witness would have, neither more nor less. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 i . 393].),Objections to evidence.]-Any objection to the compe- tency or credibility of a witness, or to the competency or relevancy of any question or answer contained in the deposition, may be made in the same manner as if the witness was examined at the trial. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 393].) But an objection to the competency of evi- dence must be made on the examination, and cannot avail, if made for the first time at the trial. (Ward v. 3V7titney, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 445.),Use of the deposition, how prevented.]-The adverse party may prevent the reading of the deposition, by satisfactory proof that sufficient notice was not given him to enable him to attend the examination, or that the examination was not in all respects fair, and conducted according to law. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 674; [2 id. 393].) But if the party actually attended the examination, and did not then object on the ground of want of sufficient notice, he cannot raise that objection for the first time on the trial. (Jackson v. Kent, 7 Cow. 59.) And it seemns that such objections must be raised by a motion to suppirss the deposition at special term, and cannot be regarded at the trial. (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 280.),ART. 8.-Sulppression of the deposition. It seems, that the deposition may be suppressed on motion, before the trial, in the same manner as in the case of a commission (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 280); that such a motion should be made where any irregularity exists which could be objeeted to thereon, and that the 372
Examination, how taken. How filed and used. adverse party will not be allowed to object at the trial, if he could have had his remedy by motion. (lb.) For the proceedings on such a motion, see post, chap. Ixxxix.,CHAPTER LXXXVII. EXAMINATION OF WITNEESES BY CONSENT. The testimony of any competent witness may be taken in this state, to be used in any civil suit or proceeding, on an agreement in writing to that effect being made between the parties or their attorneys. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 291; Laws 1847, ch. 280, Â§ 78.) Such testimony must be taken on interrogatories, to be agreed upon in the like manner, before a judge of any court of record, or local officer elected to discharge the duties of county judge, or a justice of the peace, who must, before putting the interrogatories to the witness, publicly administer to him an oath that the answers given to the same shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and the testimony must be truly and carefully reduced to writing by the officer, read to the witness, subscribed by him, and certified by the officer. (Ib.) The testimony and interrogatories must be filed with the clerk of the trial county, if the action is in the Supreme Court, or with the clerk of the court, in other cases. (Ib.) Such testimony may be used in evidence on any trial or hearing of such suit or proceeding, and every objection to the competency or credibility of the witness, or to the competency and relevancy of any answer given by him may be made in the same manner and with like efect as if such witness was personally examined at such trial or hearing. (lb.) We do not give any forms for proceeding under this statute, inasmuch as all the proceedings are regulated
Examination by consent. Nature of the proceeding. by consent, and moreover, because we deem the whole proceeding an undesirable one. If the consent of the opposite party can be had at all, it can undoubtedly be obtained to a conditional examination, and a judge's order for that purpose could be obtained on consent. That mode of proceeding is certainly preferable, as avoid. ing the necessity of written interrogatories.,CHAPTER LXXXVIII. PERPETUATION OF TESTIMONY. ARTICLE 1. Nature of the proceeding.,2. When allowed. 3. Proceedings to obtain an examination. 4. The examination. 5. Putting the deposition in evidence. 6. Effect of the deposition, and objections thereto. 7. Suppression of the deposition. AlT. 1.-Nature of the proceeding. The perpetuation of testimony was formerly one of the peculiar branches of equitable relief. It was obtained by means of a bill in chancery, and the chancery practice in this respect has never been expressly repealed, though possibly Â§ 389 of the Code may do so in effect. (See 2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 13G, for the practice in chancery.) But the Revised Statutes provide an equally effective and much more simple remedy, which has in fact completely super- seded the bill to perpetuate testimony, so that the latter proceeding is never adopted in this state, whether it is in force or not.,This proceeding is in most respects similar to a con- ditional examination, but may be had before any action is commenced, and as a matter of right, for which reasons it is preferable to an ordinary conditional examination, if the party applying for it is not pressed for time, and the witness is, or is likely to be, sick or infirm. 374
When allowed. Proceedings to obtain an examination. Affidavit.,ART. 2.-Whten allowed. Any person who is a party to a suit pending in any court of this state, or who expects to be a party in any suit about to be commenced, may cause the testimony of any witness, material to him in the prosecution or defense of such suit, to be taken conditionally, and to be per- petuated. (3 B. S. (3th ed.) 681; [2 id. 398].) Of course testimony may be taken in this manner at any stage of the action before trial. If no action is actually commenced, testimony cannot be taken in this manner unless the party expected to be adverse resides within this state, and is of full age. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].),ART. 3.-Proceedings to obtain an examination. To whIom applicatioln must be made.]--The party desiring the examination must apply to a justice of the Supreme Court, or to any officer authorized to perform the duties of such justice at chambers, or to the county judge of any county, in the manner hereafter described. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 681; [2 id. 398].) In actions pending in the New York Superior Court, this application may be made to a justice of the Supreme Court. (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 281.) It will be best to apply to an officer residing either in the trial county, or in the county in which the witness resides. Affidavit.]-The applicant must present to the officer due proof by affidavit: 1. That the applicant is a party to a suit actually pend- ing in some court of record in this state, or that he has good reason to expect to be made a party to a suit in such a court; and, 2. That the testimony of some witness within the state is material and necessary to the prosecution or defense of such suit; and,,375

If such suit is not actually commenced, that the party expected to be adverse to the applicant resides within the state, and is of full age.,Upon this proof the officer must grant the order. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 681; [2 id. 398].),No other facts need be proved than those above pre- scribed. (Jackson v. Perkins, 2 Wend. 316.) It is not necessary, therefore, to allege that the witness is in ill health, or likely to be unable to attend the trial (1T.), nor to swear to merits, nor that the applicant cannot safely proceed to trial without the desired testimony. But it must name the witness, of course.,The affidavit may be as follows:,Â§ 263. Affidavit on application to perpetuate testimony. [Titl of cause, if any.]*,COUNTY OF ............: A.

(5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) The order may direct the examination to be had before any officer authorized to perform the duties of a justice of the Supreme Court out of court, who resides in the same county with the witness; and such officer must proceed with the examination when brought before him. (3 S. S. (th ed.) 683; 2 id. 400].) The order may be in the following form:,Â§ 264. Order for examination of witness.

(3 2B. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) The service should be made in the usual manner upon the attorney, and not upon the party personally, after he has appeared by attorney. (See ante, i. 435.),Compelling attendance of witness.]-The witness may be compelled to appear by a summons, to be granted by the officer ordering his examination (3 B. 8.

If, how. ever, the adverse party attends the examination, and does not object to the service, no proof thereof is necessary. (See Jackson v. Kent, 7 Cow. 59.),.Examination.]-The judge must then take the deposi. tion of the witness conditionally, and may adjourn the examination from day to day until it is completed. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) It is not necessary that the judge should personally write down the testimony of the witness. He may depute the counsel, or any one else, to act as an amanuensis, so long as he retains su. pervision of the examination. (Macdonald v. Garrison, 9 Abb. 34; 2 Hilt. 510.),The examination is conducted precisely as at a trial. No written interrogatories are necessary.,Every answer or declaration of the witness must be inserted in the deposition, if either party requires it to be done. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) Irrelevant ques- tions cannot, however, be inserted, nor answers to them be required. (See Gibson v. Pearsall, 1 E. D. Smith, 90.),The deposition.]-The deposition of the witness must be carefully read to, and subscribed by him, must be certified by the judge before whom it was taken, and within ten days thereafter must be filed with the clerk of the county in which it was taken (not in the trial county), together with the original order for the examination, the affidavits on which it was founded, and the affidavit of service of the order. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) See further on this subject, ante, p. 368. The form of certificate there given, Â§ 262, will suffice with very slight modifications.,AnT. 5-Putting the deposition in evidence.

S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) It is to be observed that absence from the state is not made a suffi- cient reason for admitting the deposition as evidence.,Proof of inability to attend.]-See the remarks on this subject, ante, p. 371, which are all fully applicable to this proceeding. Proof of regnlarity.]-The original affidavits filed with the deposition, or certified copies thereof, are sufficient presumptive evidence of the facts therein contained, to show a compliance with the statute. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) AnT. 5.--Effect of the deposition, and objections thereto. Effect.]-The deposition when put in evidence, has the same effect as oral testimony and no other. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) Objections.]-Any objection to the competency or credi- bility of the witness, or to the relevancy of any question put to, or answer given by him, may be made in the same manner as if the witness were personally examined on the trial. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 682; [2 id. 399].) There is no special provision made for objections to the regularity of the deposition itself, and probably such objections must be raised by a motion to suppress it. See the nest article.,ART. 7.-Suppression of the deposition. It seems, that a motion may be made to suppress the deposition, in the same manner as in the case of a com- mission (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 280), and that such a,379

Courts of common law had no power to issue commis- sions except so far as it was given to them by statute. (M'Cotter v. Hooker, 8 N.Y. [4 Seld.] 497.) But courts of equity possessed that power inherently, and the statute on the subject did not affect them. (Brotwv v. Southworth, 9 Paige, 353.),Under the Code of Procedure, all courts of record are courts of equity as well as of law, and it may well be doubted whether the issuing of a commission in any action whatever, is confined to the strict letter of the statute. But the courts generally assume that such is the case, in every action.,The commission may be granted in any action in which an issue of fact has been joined, or a default taken, when a material witness for either party resides out of the state 380
In what cases. At what stage of the action. (3 R. 8. (5ts ed.) 675; [2 id. 393]; as amended, Laws 1862, ch. 375.) And though the witness usually resides in the state, yet if he is absent for any length of time, a commission may issue for his examination. (Pooler v. Maples, 1 Wend. 65.) A commission may issue to examine a party as a witness, either on the application of such party (Block v. Haas, sp. t., 8 Abb. 335; Bigelow v. Mal- lory, 17 How. 427; see Code, Â§ 399; overruling Fairbanks v. Tregent, 8 Abb. 66); or of any other party. (Brolcway v. Stanton, 2 Sands. 640; Code, Â§ 390.),A commission cannot be issued for the examination of witnesses in supplementary proceedings. (Graham v. Col- burn, sp. t., 14 How. 52.) But it might be issued to obtain evidence on any interlocutory proceeding of sufficient importance to warrant the expense and delay. AnT. 2.-At what stage of the action the application should,be nade. Neither party can apply for a commission until an issue of fact has been joined (3 R. S. (5th el.) 675; [2 id. 393] ); unless a default has been taken upon failure to plead. (Laws 1862, ch. 375.) The motion should be made as soon as possible after issue has been joined, otherwise costs may be imposed (Lafarge v. Luce, 2 Wend. 242; Burr v. Skinner, 1 Johns. Cas. 391; but see Beall v. Dey, 7 Wend. 513), and no stay of proceedings will be allowed (Butler v. Fox, 9 0. B. 199; Starbuck v. Hall, sp. t., 1 How. 58; Brydges v. Fisher, 4 Moore & Sc. 458; see De JRossi v. Pollill, 7 Scott, 836; but see Summers v. Rawson, 3 Jur. 288); but a commis- sion without a stay may be granted at any time up to the trial (ib.), unless, in connection with other circumstances, the delay is so great as to cast suspicion upon the good faith of the application, when it may be denied altogether. (See Forrest v. Forrest, 3 Bosw. 661; 9 Abb. 289.) Or in a case of great delay, but not positive bad faith, the com-,381

Hall, sp. t., 1 How. 58.),When the defendant desires a commission, he ought to move within a reasonable time after joining issue, and before notice of trial, or costs may be imposed upon him (Burr v. Skinner, 1 Johns. Cas. 391); but if the plaintiff serves notice of trial on the day that issue is joined (Ives v. Jones, 1 Wend. 283), or even within a few days there- after (Foster v. Agassiz, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 150), the defendant will not be obliged to pay costs, as he is en- titled to a reasonable time. (Ib.) And the courts consider twenty days a reasonable time. (Bank of Charleston v. Hurlbut, 1 Sands. 717; 1 Code Rep. 96; Mliunson v. Willard, sp. t., 5 How. 263; Colvin v. Bragden, sp. t., id. 124.),Mere delay, which has not prejudiced the adverse party, does not seem to be any objection to a commission, even with a stay of proceedings. (Beal v. Dey, 7 Wend. 513.),A commission cannot be allowed in proceedings sup- plementary to execution. (Grah7am v. Colburn, sp. t., 14 How. 52.),ART. 3.--Motion for commission. Where made.]-The motion for a commission must be made within the district in which the action is triable, or in a county adjoining the trial county. (Erwin v. Foor- hees, 26 Barb. 127; Sturgess v. Weed. 13 How. 130.) The statute of 1847 (c7h. 470, Â§ 15), to the contrary, is in so far repealed by Â§ 401 of the Code. (lb.),Before w7hom.]-The motion may be made before the court (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 393]), or if the action is in the Supreme Court, before any judge thereof, or any county judge, in the county of his residence, whether in term time or vacation. (3 R. S. (5th7 ed.) 293; Laws 1847, ch. 470, Â§ 15.),The court will not hear the motion if it has been made before a judge out of court, and denied by him. (Allen v. Gibbs, 12 Wend. 202.) 382
Motion for commission. Affidavit. What must be stated. Affidavit.]-The motion should be founded on an affi- davit, stating that an issue of fact has been joined in the cause (Allen v. Hendree, 6 Cow. 400; see ante, p. 381), naming the witnesses to be examined (Wtright v. Jessup, 3 Duer, 642; Gunter v. M'Tear, 1 Mees. & W. 201; see Forrest v. Forrest, 3 Bosw. 661; 9 Abb. 289; Franklin v. United States Ins. Co., 2 Johns. Cas. 68; Cow v. Kinnersley, 6 Man. & Gr. 981; 7 Scott N. R. 892; but see contra MI'Hardy v. Hitchcock, 11 Beav. 93; 17 L. J. [Ch.] 256; Carbonell v. Bessell, 5 Sim. 636), or at any rate, some of them; which will suffice if the application appears to be in good faith (Beresford v. Eastolise, 8 Dowl. P. C. 294; Dimond v. Yallance, 7 id. 590); and if a substantial excuse is given for the applicant's inability to name his witnesses, his omission to name them will not prejudice his application. (Shaffer v. Wilcox, 2 Hall, 502; see Wright v. Jesslup, 3 Duer, 642.) The affidavit must fur- ther state that the applicant has fully and fairly stated the case in the cause to his counsel (stating his name and residence, ante, i. 183), and disclosed to him the facts which he expects to prove by each and every of the witnesses mentioned (Seymour v. Strong, 19 Wend. 98); but it need not state what those facts are. (Eaton v. North, 7 Barb. 631.) It must also aver that the witness is out of the state (see ante, p. 380), and is a material witness, (ib.; see Eaton v. North, 7 Barb. 631), and the advice of counsel as to his materiality (Lansing v. Mickle, sp. t., 1 How. 248; see Seymour v. Strong, 19 Wend. 98); unless the affidavit is made by the attorney or counsel for the appli- cant (Beall v. Dey, 7 Wend. 513; see Eaton v. North, 7 Barb. 631.) It is not necessary to state that the applicant cannot safely proceed to trial without the witness. (Brackett v. Dudley, 1 Cow. 209.),If the application is made by the defendant, and he desires a stay of proceedings, he must swear to merits in the usual manner (Meech v. Calkins, 4 Hill, 534; Brisban,383
Motion for commission. Affidavit. What must be stated. v. Hoyt, 1 Wend. 27; Franklin v. United States Ins. Co., 2 Johns. Cas. 285); and in an affidavit prepared and used solely for this motion. (See Cutler v. Biggs, 2 Hill, 409; Colegate v. Marsh, sp. t., 2 How. 137; Poplian v. Baker, sp. t., 1 id. 166; Robinson v. Sinclair, sp. t., id. 107.) But the commission will be granted without a stay, where merits are not sworn to (1Meech v. Calkins, supra; Warner v. Harvey, 9 Wend. 444); nor is it necessary for the llain. tiff to swear to merits for any purpose.,It is not necessary to swear to the good faith of the application (Baddeley v. Gilmore, 1 MIees. & W. 55), nor to the competency of the evidence sought (ib.), unless there is prima facie ground for doubting it. (Lloyd v. Key, 3 Dowl. P. C. 253.) Nor is it necessary to show that any effort has been made to obtain the attendance of the wit- ness at the trial. (Norton v. Melbourne, 3 Scott, 398; 3 Bing. N. C. 57.),The affidavit may be made by the attorney of the appli- cant (Eaton v. North, 7 Barb. 631; see Beall v. Dey, 7 Wend. 513), or his attorney in fact (Murray v. Kirll)atrick, 1 Cow. 210), or by the attorney's clerk (M'Hardy v. Hitch- cock, 11 Beav. 93; 17 L. J. [Ch.] 256), or if no stay of proceedings is desired, by any person acquainted with the facts. (De Mar v. Van Zandt, 2 Johns. Cas. 69.),The cases seem to hold that no excuse is necessary for the want of the applicant's personal oath, but we think it will be required whenever a stay of proceedings is granted. (And see Eaton v. North, 7 Barb. 631.),The affidavit may be in the following form:,Â§ 265. Affidavit on motion for commission. [Title of cause.],CoNTY OF ............ : A. B., being duly sworn, says: 1. That he is the [defendant] in this action. [If the dleonent is not a party, state why the party does not make the affidavit.] 384

That issue was joined in this action on the ........ day of ..........., 18...., [and if the cause is noticed for trial, state wlhen, by wlom,n and for what circuit or term.] 3. That deponent l:as fully and fairly stated the case in this cause to ........... , Esq., his counsel therein, who resides at ....... ......, and has fully and fairly disclosed to him the facts which deponent expects to prove by the witness [or, each and every of the witnesses] hereafter named. 4. That the deponent is advised by his said counsel, after such statement, and verily believes, [that lie has a good and substantial defense to Ihis action on the merits, and] that C.

I[Ju rat.] [Sijatutre.] Nrotice of motion.]-The motion must be brought before the court on the usual notice of eight (lays, or on ain order to show cause (Watson v. Dlafiehl, 2 Caines, 2(i0), except where the defendant has not appeared in the action. (Laws 1862, c7h. 375.) The statute requires notice to be given ten days before applying to a jludge out of court (3 t. S. (Sth ed.) 675; [2 id. 393]), and, perhaps, Â§ 413 of the Code has not aflected this rule. It is usual to state the names of the commissioners proposed, in the notice (1 Burr. Pr. 443), but this is not strictly necessary, and may be impracticable.,The notice may be in the following form:,Â§ 206. Notice of motion for a commission. [As in Â§ 38, ante, i. 412, asking] for an order that a commission issue in this action, directed to A. B., Esq., of ........, [coln- selor-at-law], for the examination of C. D., of ........, as a wit- ness in this action, upon interrogatories to be annexed to the commission in which the [plaintiff] may join; and tiat the trial of this action be stayed until the return of the said commission, or for such other [ctc.],49
Offer of costs. Opposing the motion. Offer of costs.]-When the applicant has delayed mov. ing until his opponent has noticed the cause for trial, he should stipulate in his notice to pay the costs incurred in preparing for trial, otherwise he will not only be required to pay those costs, but also the costs of resisting the mo- tion. (Lafarge v. Luce, 2 Wend. 242; see Starbuck v. Hall, sp. t., 1 How. 58.) This rule does not apply, however, to motions made within twenty days after joinder of issue. (See ante, p. 382.),Olpposing the motion.]-The motion may be opposed on the common grounds of want of due notice or other irregularity; and also on the ground of delay, in which case costs will be imposed (see Starbuck v. Hall, sp. t., 1 How. 58; Lafarrge v. Luce, 2 Wend. 242); or by casting doubt upon the good faith of the application, when the court will require affidavits on behalf of the applicant, making out a clear case. (Rogers v. Rogers, 7 Wend. 514; a nulervoortv. Columbian Ins. Co., 3 Johns. Cas. 137; see Lloyd v. Key, 3 Dowl. P. 0. 253.),Proof that the applicant could obtain the evidence that he seeks from resident witnesses, may tend to show bad faith in the motion, but is not conclusive, as each party has the right to select such witness as will testify most favorably for him. (Adams v. Corfield, 28 L. J. [Ex.] 31.),A commission would not formerly be refused on an affidavit that the witnesses proposed to be examined were incompetent by reason of interest (Graves v. Delaplaine, 11 Johns. 200), and that objection is now obsolete, but on the same principle, perhaps no objection to the compe- tency of the witnesses would be regarded on this motion. This, however, we greatly doubt, inasmuch as the only disqualifications of witnesses now are of a solid and permanent character, which cannot be removed by their own act, as interest could.,Where great delay may be caused by the commission, and there is doubt as to the availability of the evidence, 386
The motion. Opposing the motion. Stay of proooedings. the adverse party may obtain an order that the applicant serre him with an affidavit, stating what facts he expects to prove under the commission, and upon the adverse party stipulating to admit such facts, the motion will be denied. (Bank of Commerce v. Michel, 1 Sands. 687.) But the stipulation must admit the facts, and not merely that the witness will testify to such facts. (lb.; see People rermilyea, 7 Cow. 369.) In connection with other circumstances, it is a good ground of opposition to show that the expense of the commission will exceed the amount in controversy. (Mitclell v. Montgomery, 4 Sands. 676.) Thus, where this objection was raised, and it also appeared that the witness was expected to testify to a point on which there was conflicting evidence at a former trial, the motion was denied. (Ib.) Olposing the commissioners.]-The moving party has a right to name all the commissioners in the first instance, and the adverse party cannot have any of them stricken out as of course, but must show a valid cause of objection (Harris v. Wilson, 2 Wend. 627), upon affidavit, and not merely upon suggestion. (Biays v. Merrihew, 3 Johns. 251.),ART. 4.-Stay of proceedings. An order for a commission does not operate as a stay of proceedings unless it expressly provides for the same. (Maynard v. Chapin, 7 Wend. 520.) In order to obtain a stay of proceedings, it is necessary to move promptly (see ante, p. 381), or to pay the costs incurred by delay. (See ante, p. 386.) The applicant may, of course, obtain a stay of proceed- ings to enable him to make the motion, in the usual manner (see ante, i. 416), but if the cause is noticed for trial, no stay can be granted with effect within ten days before the circuit, by any judge in or out of court, except,387
Stay of proceedings. The commission, and order therefor.,~-- the one who is to hold such circuit. (Ante, i. 190, Rule 39; and see Kimball v. Knights, 18 Wend. 657.),It is usual to grant with the commission, unless for some of the reasons previously enumerated there is good reason to doubt the good faith of the application or the importance of the testimony, a stay of the trial until the return of the commission. There is no valid objection to this course on the ground of the indefiniteness of the term, because the adverse party may, if the return of the com- mission is unreasonably delayed, move to proceed to trial without it. (See post, art. 9.) Nevertheless, the court or judge can limit the time to a fixed period, and in pro- per cases will do so, in order to encourage diligence. Un- less, for peculiar reasons, which, however, we can easily conceive to exist in certain cases, the trial only should be stayed (or whatever proceeding the commission is to be used upon), and other proceedings in the action should be left unfettered.,The judge granting a stay may impose such terms as seem proper to him. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) Ã³75; [2 id. 393].) If a stay is refused, the only remedy is to appear at the trial, and ask for a postponement of the cause.,ART. 5.-The commiission, and order therefor. Discretion of the court.]-The statute vests the court with a discretion in the premises (Ring v. Mott, 2 Sands. 683), and though a commission without a stay is usually granted almost as of course (ib.), yet even that is not a matter of strict right. (Ib.; see Mitehell v. laonitgomery, 4 Sands. 676.),The court may impose such terms, upon granting a commission, as may seem to it just. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 393]; Laws 1862, c7. 375; see Ablon v. Barlboy, 1 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 154; Clayton v. Yarrin'gtol, 16 Abb. 273 n.) 388
COMMISSION TO TAKE TESTIMONY.,Order for a commission. I,Â§ 267. Order for a commtission. [Title of cause.] [Captio7n.] On reading and filing [cec.] and on motion of [c&c.] after hearing [&ec.] ORDERED: 1. That a commission issue in this cause, directed to ............., Esq., and ..........., Esq., of ............. [counselors-at-law], to examine upon oath, on interrogatories to be annexed to the said commission, ............ of ............ as a witness on behalf of the [defendant] in this action. 2. That the [plaintiff] be at liberty to join in the said commis- sion. 3. That the trial of this action be stayed until the return of the said commission. Though a doubt has been expressed on the point (Davenport v. Averill, 2 Wend. 646), it seems clear to us that the successful applicant should serve a certified copy of the order upon his opponent, in order to stay proceed- ings. The order should in all cases be filed (3 B. . 5th ed.),389 Tie order.]-An order in writing must always be drawn up, which should direct a commission to issue, naming the commissioners, and the ritnesses, if possible (see lWright v. Jessup, 3 Duer, 642); indeed it is doubt- ful whether an order granted by a judge out of court, not naming or identifying witnesses, is regular (see Clinwick v. Benwick, 10 Paige, 420), though if the order is made by the court, it has power to dispense with this rule. (Nicol v. Alison, 11 Q. B. 1006.) It should not contain any directions as to the mode of returning the commission, inasmuch as that matter is placed by the statute in the discretion of the judge who settles the interrogatories (see post, art. 6), and if such directions are contained in it, they are void. (Atlerton v. Thomas, cited in Fleming v. IIollenlback, 7 Barb. 271.) The order may be as follows:
Order for a commission. Commission to examine witnesses. 675; [2 id. 394]), and if not filed, the commission is irregu. lar. (W7itney v. Wyncoop, 4 Abb. 370.),The court will not direct the commission to be executed in any unusual manner, unless very material advantages are to be gained by doing so. (Ferrie v. Pub. Adninistra- tor, 3 Bradf. Surr. I. 249.),In Deshon v. Packwood, (sp. t., 16 Abb. 272 n.), HOFFMAr , J., said that there was no precedent for directing an oral examination of the witnesses. (See also Forrest v. Forrest, 3 Bosw. 661.) But in Clayton v. Yarrington (16 Abb. 273 n.), it was made a condition of the order, at the in- stance of the adverse party, that the applicant should consent to an oral examination.,The Conmmission.]-The commission may be in the fol- lowing form:,Â§ 268. Commission to examine witnesses. [SEAL.] Ust etopIe of slye 2tatte d Rel sign:,To ............ Esq., of ............. WHEREAnS, it appears to our [Supreme] Court that A. B., of .........,, in your said state, is a material witness in an action now pending in our said court, between John Smith, plaintiff, and John Jones, defendant, we have therefore appointed you a com- missioner to examine the said witness, and authorize you to ex- amine him upon the interrogatories hereto annexed, on his corporal oath, to be first taken before you, and direct you to reduce his testimony to writing, and to cause the same to be signed by him and yourself, and to return the same annexed to this commission, with all convenient speed, to our said court, enclosed under your seal.,WITNESS, &c. The commission must be sealed, and, being issued by the special order of the court, the want of a seal is a fatal defect. (Ford v. Williams, 24 N. Y. 359; T~rac v. Suy- dam, 30 Barb. 110; Whitney v. Wynkoop, 4 Abb. 370.),To every commission there must be annexed a copy of 390
The commission. Interrogatories on commission. the 16th section of art. 2, tit. 3, chap. 7, part 3 of the Revised Statutes (which is on page 395 of the original edition), and such additional instructions may be annexed as the case may require. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 395].) But if the body of the commission contains the substance of this section of the statute, that is sufficient. (Hall v. Barton, 25 Barb. 274.) If the commission is correctly executed, the court will presume that this section was an- nexed, until the contrary is shown. (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.) The witnesses must be named, or at least identified, in the commission. (Renwvick v. Renwick, 10 Paige, 420.) ART. 6.-Settlement of interrogatories, and final directions. The commission being issued, the next step to be taken is to prepare the interrogatories. The following form will sufficiently illustrate the manner in which they should be framed:,Â§ 269. Interrogatories on commission. [ltle of cause.] Interrogatories to be administered to A. B., of ........, a wit. ness to be examined under the annexed commission, on behalf of the [plaintiff] in the above entitled action. P;rst. What is your name, age, occupation and residence. Second. Do you know the parties above named, or any of them? if so, which of them, and how long have you known each of them ? Third. [Any number of interrogatories may be put, according to the circumstances of the case.] Lastly. Do you know of anything concerning the matters in question, that may tend to the benefit and advantage of the [plain- tiff]? If so, declare the same fully and at large, as if you had been particularly interrogated concerning the same.,CHAS. T. FoLGEB,,[Plaintif"s] Attorney. The last interrogatory given in the above form is a perfectly legitimate one (McCarty v. Edwards, 24 How.,391
Interrogatories on commission. Settlement, 236; see Percival v. Hiccey, 18 Johns. 257), and its value is apparent.,All the other interrogatories should be framed in con- formity to the rules concerning oral examinations of witnesses.,Settlement.]-The interrogatories must be settled by a judge of the court, or, if the action is in the Supreme Court, by any officer authorized to perform the duties of a judge thereof out of court. (3 1. S. (Sth ed.) 675, Â§ 14; [2 id. 394].) If Erdwi v. Voorheces (26 Barb. 127), decides that no county judge has power to settle interrogatories in an action in the Supreme Court, which perhaps it does, it is unquestionably erroneous. The statute plainly con- sers that power upon them.*,The moving party must give notice of the time and place of settlement (3 1. S. (Sth ed.) G75; [2 id. 394]), and by the former practice of the court, which seems to remain in force, though the rule prescribing it is not in existence, four days' notice was sufficient. (1 Burr. Pr. 443; TVa Santv. Eq. Pr. 289; Holmes & Dis. Pr. 327.),A copy of the interrogatories should be served with the notice, though this seems to be a merely formal matter, for additional interrogatories may be offered for settlement, though not served. (See 3 B. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 394].),The adverse party may prepare cross interrogatories, which were formerly required by rule to be served two days before the settlement (1 Burr. Pr. 443); but for the same reasons as before stated, it would be ungracious, if not absolutely useless, to object on this ground to inter- rogatories.,Either party may except to interrogatories proposed, and the judge should reject questions not pertinent to * Erwin v. Voorhees has been reversed in the Court of Appeals, since the text was written. 392
Interrogatories. Settlement. Allowance and direction. the issue. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 394].) It seems that he has no right to exclude interrogatories on the mere ground that they are leading. That point should be reserved for the trial. (Fleming v. Hollenback7, 7 Barb. 271.) Interrogatories which cannot, in any possible event, be admissible on the trial, should be rejected on settlement (Macalonald v. Garrison, 9 Abb. 178); but if there is any reasonable ground for supposing that the testimony to be elicited may be material at the trial, the interrogatories should be allowed. (See ib.) And, in general, interroga- tories ought to be treated liberally, since a sufficient remedy against any that are improper may be had at the trial. Objections on the ground of the incompetency of evi- dence to be elicited by the interrogatories proposed, must be raised at the settlement, or they cannot be made at the trial. (Francis v. Ocean, Ins. Co., 6 Cow. 404 ;* see Ward v. WhIitney, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 442.) Copies of documents to be identified by a witness may and should be annexed to the interrogatories (Conmmercial Bank v. Union Bank, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 209), and it is not necessary to annex the originals (ib.); nor can either party be compelled by the court to do so, even though a photograph of the original be taken at the expense of the other party. (Butler v. Lee, 32 Barb. 75; 19 How. 383.) Allowance and direction.]-The interrogatories being settled, the judge must indorse thereon his allowance of them (for which no particular form is necessary), and annex them to the commission. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 394].) Upon the commission he must indorse a direction for its return in some specific manner, which may be by) mail to the clerk of the court or trial county. (Ib.) *Affirmed on other grounds, this point being questioned, 2 Wend 64,71.,50,393
Interrogatories. Allowance and direction. Execution of commission.,-~- This direction is indispensable in order to give vitality to the commission, except by consent, as hereafter stated. Directions in the original order for the commission are of no avail. (At7erton v. Thomas, cited in Fleming v. HoUen. back, 7 Barb. 271.),The direction mnay be indorsed on the interrogatories, when annexed to the commission (Hurd v. Pendrigh, 2 Hill, 502), or may be contained in the body of the corn. mission only (Hall v. Barton, 25 Barb. 274); but in all cases it must be signed by the judge who settled the interrogatories, or the deposition cannot be read in evi- dence. (Crawford v. Loper, 25 Barb. 449.),Directions which are impossible of performance, or which can only be complied with by immoral means, are void. The judge cannot nullify the benefit of the statute by impracticable directions. (Brwenst7iTI v. James, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 300.),Direction by consent.]-The parties may agree between themselves as to the manner in which the commission shall be returned, and upon filing such an agreement, in writing, in the clerk's office, the attorney for the party suing out the commission may indorse on it a direction pursuant to such agreement, which must be obeyed by the commissioners. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 395].),Where a stipulation between parties directed that either party might receive the commission, and deliver it to the clerk, which was done, it was held that the omission to state in the direction the clerk's residence, was immate- rial. (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.),ART. 7.-Execution of the commission. The commissioners must adopt such means of com- pelling the attendance of witnesses as the laws of their state or country provide. The commission usually pre- scribes the number of the commissioners necessary to 394
Elention of the commission. Oaths. The examination. form a quorum, but if it does not, all who are named in it must join in its execution, or nothing can be done.,The examination.]-The parties and their counsel may attend the examination. (Union Bank of lSandusky v. Tor- rae, 5 Duer, 626; 2 Abb. 269.) If they thus appear, per- sonally or by counsel, they are deemed to waive any error in the proceedings, to which they do not object, such as the omission to put an interrogatory. (Ot. of Errors, Broawn v. Kimball, 25 Wend. 259.) The commissioners must publicly administer an oath to each witness, that the answers to be given by him to the interrogatories proposed to him shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. (3 B. S. (5th ed) 676; [2 il. 394].) If the commissioners are not allowed by the law of their country to administer oaths, the oath may be administered by any local authority. (Lincoln v. Battelle, 6 Wend. 476.) The oath should be administered in the form most binding upon the conscience of the witness, and an affirm- ation, similar to that in use here, is sufficient. But an oath less broad than that prescribed by statute,-as, an oath "to make true answers to the interrogatories to be pro- posed,"-is insufficient. (Whitney v. Wyncoop, 4 Abb. 370.) No witness can be examined who is not named in the commission (Brown v. Southworth, 9 Paige, 351), even though he was intended to be examined, and misnamed by mistake. (lb.) Cross interrogatories cannot be withdrawn on the ex- amination, except by mutual consent (Union Bank of San- dusky v. Torrey, 2 Abb. 269; 5 Duer, 626; Dodge v. Israel, 4 Wash. 0. 0. 324; see Brown v. Davis, 25 Wend. 259), and of course direct interrogatories are subject to the same rule. Each interrogatory must be answered specifically. (Vnion Bank of Sandusky v. Torrey, 2 Abb. 269; 5 Duer, 626; Willis v. Welch, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 64.) It is not enough for the witness to refer to his answer to a,__,395
Execution of the commission. Examination. Deposition. former interrogatory, particularly on cross-examination, as the party examining is entitled to demand a reitera. tion of the facts. (Ib.),Every answer of the witness should be taken down, and he should not be allowed to cancel his testimony, and commence anew. No matter what statements or explana- tions lie may make, his original evidence must be recorded. (Semble, Creamer v. Jackson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 413.),Though the mere fact of the attorney for a party hav- ing consultedl with a witness, and shaped the form of his answers, prior to his examination, is not of itself a fatal objectibn to the testimony (Commercial Bank of Pcnn. v. Union Bank, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 203), yet, when conjoined with other slight grounds for suspecting that the witness was tampered with, it is ground for suppressing the entire deposition (Creamner v. Jackson, supra); for a witness'can. not be allowed to come to his examination with his an- swers all written down. (Ib.; Underhill v. Van Cortlault, 2 Johns. Ch. 339.),Thle depositiol.]-The examination of each witness must be reduced to writing, under the direction of the com- missioners, subscribed by the witness, and certified by such of the commissioners as are present at its taking. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 394].) It is not necessary that the commissioners should personally reduce the tes- tilony to writing. They may employ a clerk for that purpose (Macdonald v. Garrison, 9 Abb. 34; Keane v. Meade, 3 Peters, 8), though they are not bound to do so. (2 Har. & Johns. 442.),The deposition should be read over to the witness, or he should be allowed to read it, and requested to subscribe his name thereto. (See 2 R. S. 394.) If, however, he refuses to sign it, it is none the less valid (Clarke v. Saw. yer, 3 Sands. Ch. 351, 378, 414); but, of course, if he makes any objection in good faith to the report of his testimony, it should be corrected if erroneous, or if not 396
Execution of the commission. Deposition. Return. erroneous, he should be allowed to add any explanations that le may desire to make. Exhibits produced at the examination, and proved by any witness, must be annexed to his deposition, sub- scribed by the witness, and certified by the commissioners. (3 R. S. (5thL ed.) G76; 2 id. 394].) It is suflicient, how- ever, to produce an original document at the examination, to have it thus marked, a copy verified by the witness, and to annex such copy to tile deposition. It is not rea- sonable to require any one to part with valuable original documents, and to expose them to the risks of a journey with a commission. (ALLEN, J., Commercial Banl7 of Penn. v. Union Bank, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 209; see Jackso)n v. Shepherd, 6 Cow. 444; but see Jacklsol v. Hobby, 20 Johns. 357.),The commissioners must subscribe their names, or initials (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249), to eatc sheet of the depositions. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 394].) They must annex all the depositions and exhibits to the commission (ib.), which may be done in any convenient manner, as by wafers or by tape. (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.) Return or report.]-The examination being concluded, the commissioners must make a written return (or report) of their proceedings, on the back of the commission (3 1. 8. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 394] ); or of any of the documents annexed to the commission, such as the depositions or interrogatories (M'Cleary v. Edwards, 27 Barb. 239; Hall v. Barton, 25 id. 274; see Pendell v. Coon, 20 N. Y. 134); and if these papers are so full as to leave no room for the return, it may be made on a separate sheet, and attached to the commission (Pendell v. Coon, 20 N. Y. 134); though it is best to write a part of the return on one of these papers, even though it should be only a few words. (See ib.) If the return is made without necessity on a separate,397
Return or report. Contents. How construed,- ~ ~ ~ ~ - piece of paper, it is void. (Fleming v. Hollenback, 7 Barb, 271; as limited in the preceding cases).,The return may vary sometimes from any regular form that can be given, but its main features will always be the same. Thus, it should state the fact of the exami. nation, the manner in which it was conducted (Bailis v. Cochran, 2 Johns. 417), showing a compliance with the directions of the commission; and if the parties appeared by counsel, it is desirable that the fact should be stated.,The return is, however, liberally construed, and if it can reasonably be inferred from its terms that the con. mission was properly executed, it is sufficient. The court will presume that the commissioners performed their duty faithfully. (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.) Thus, it is not Absolutely necessary (though proper), that the return should state that the witnesses were "publicly" sworn, for that will be presumed. (Willianms v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249; Halleran v. Field, 23 Wend. 38.) And if the commissioners certify that the witnesses were sworn by virtue of the commission, it will be presumed that they were properly sworn and examined, and their depositions reduced to writing under the direction of the commission. ers. (Bolte v. Van Rooten, 4 Johns. 130.) And though the caption states that the deposition was taken before "us," if it is signed by only one of the commissioners, it will be presumed that he alone executed the commission. (Williams v. .Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.),It is never necessary that the return should certify that it was deposited in the post office. Such a statement could not be true at the time it is made, and cannot be required even by the express directions of a judge (Br'umskill v. James, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 294, 300.),We recommend the following form of return for use, as containing desirable information, and as respectful to the court: 398
Execution of commission. Return and filing of the commission.,270. Return indorsed on Commnission. [7tle of Cause.] To the Supreme Court of the State of New York: The undersigned, [one of] the commissioners appointed by your honorable court for the examination of John Nokes and Stephen Stokes, witnesses in this cause [the other commissioners having declined to act], respectfully report: That the said witnesses attended before us, and being severally publicly sworn by us [or, by A.

[ Or state the objections raised, if any.] E F.,G. 1I. Commissioners. AnT. 8.---Return and filing of the commission. The commissioners having made and signed the return prescribed in the last article, must close up all the papers connected with the commission, and put them under seal. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 id. 394].) This is usually done by putting the papers in a large envelope of strong paper, tied securely with tape, on each crossing of which a wax seal is placed, and across which the commissioners write their names. (1 Burr. Pr. 445.) They must then address the package to the clerk of the court from which the commission issued, or if the action is in the Supreme Court, to the clerk of the trial county, athis place of residence. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675; [2 ?i. 394].) But when, by stipulation, the papers are transmitted by private messenger, imperfections in the direction are of,399

Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249.),Return) by lani7.]--A return by mail has been held allowable only when directed by tile officer who settles the interrogatories. (Riweardson v. Gere, 21 Wend. 156; see Fle),ing v. Ilol7leba7e, 7 Barb. 271; Hall v. Barton, 25 id. 274.) But this dlecision was made in a court of la(w, which hlad (o power indepen dent of the statute. In equity, the depositions could alwlays be returned by mail, without a special order (Brown! v. Solithworth, 9 Paige, 351); and tuder. the Code, which assimilates the practice at law and equity, we are decidedly of opinion that the equity rule has superseded the Ilore stringent rule of the statute, and that in every case the commission and documents may be returned by mail, unle;s a different order is made.,When the packet is to be returned by mail, the com- missioners slould put it in the nearest post office, imme- diately after sealing it. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 395].) But the deposition is not invalidated by mere delay in thus mailing it. (Ialleran v.. Field, 23 Wend. 3S.) The clerk to whom the packet is addressed must receive it from the post oflice, and open it. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 676; [2 id. 395].),Return by 9messenlger.]-If the directions with the com- mission provide for its return by an atge;t of the party who procured it, the packet must be delivered to such agent. (3 -. S.

D., Esq., [counselor-at-law], of the [city] of ........ who is a com- missioner, as deponent is informed [by him] and believes, named in the commission enclosed in the said packet. 2. That said packet has not been opened or altered since depo- nent so received it. [Jurat.] [Signature.] If the agent is dead, or from sickness or other casualty is unable to deliver the packet personally, the clerk or judge may receive it from the hands of any other person, upon such person making affidavit that he received it from the agent, that the latter is dead, or otherwise una- ble to deliver it, that it has not been opened or altered since the deponent received it, and that he believes it has not been opened or altered since it came from the hands of the commissioners. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) (;76; [2 id. 395].) This affidavit cannot be dispensed with, except by ex- press consent. And a direction, by consent, that the commission may be returned by express, does not waive the necessity for an affidavit to this effect. (Dwinelle v. Howtland, sp. t., 1 Abb. 87; criticised in Creamer v. Jack- son, sp. t., 4 id. 413.) Filing tie papers.]-The officer receiving the commis- sion and accompanying documents, must file them in the office of the clerk of the court, or if the action is pending hi the Supreme Court, in the office of the clerk of the county in which the other papers in the action are filed.

(3 R. S. (5th ed.) 677; [2 id. 395].),The depositions cannot be used as evidence unless they have been actually filed. (Jackson v. Hobby, 20 Johns. 357.),AnT. 9.-Prioceedings ib case of delay iln. return. If proceedings in the action have been stayed until the return of the colmmission, it is the duty of the party who applied for it to procure its return within such time as, under the circumstances of each particular case, may be reasonable. (See Coles v. Thomson, 1 Cai. 517.),It would be in vain to attempt to prescribe any rule as to what is a reasonable time, so much depending upon the distance, the amount of testimony to be taken, and other considerations.,If the commission was obtained by the plaintiff, the defendant, after the expiration of a reasonable time, may move to dismiss the complaint for want of progress in the action, and the plaintiff will be required to stipulate as usual. (Coles v. Thomson, 1 Cai. 517.) For the proceed- ings upon this motion, see ante, p. 340.,If the commission was obtained by the defendant (Rtsh v. Cobbett, 2 Johns. Cas. 70; Kirby v. Watkies, 1 Cai. 503), or if both parties have joined in it (S'hitter v. Ialett, 1 Cai. 115), the plaintiff, after the expiration of a reasonable time, may obtain leave, upon motion, to proceed to trial. (Soss v. Fielden, 2 Sands. 690; Pell v. Bunker, 2 Cai. 46; Boucherean v. le Guen, 2 Johns. 196.) After such a motion is granted, the defendant may obtain a postpone- ment at the trial. (Ib.),The motion on either side may be opposed by showing that a reasonable time has not elapsed, and would not elapse before the trial come on, or that the moving party has himself caused the delay (see Boucherean v. Le GukeÂ¢, 2 Johns. 196); but this must be proved by direct allega- 402
prooeedings in case of delay in return. Suppression of the deposition. tions and reasonable evidence (ib.); and on such proof, the motion should be denied. Ignorance of the location of tle witness is an excuse (Ferris v. Smith, 2 Cai. 253), and so is the accidental mis- laying of the commission (Cotos v. Thlomsont, 2 Cai. 47), but the latter excuse would certainly not save the party from the imposition of terms. If the plaintiff proceeds to trial without leave, the de- fendant may have the cause struck off the calendar, but if instead of so doing, he appears and takes part in the trial without objection, he waives the irregularity. (Brain v. Rodelicks, 1 Cai. 73.),ART. 10.-Sullpression of the depositiot. If there have been any irregularities in the issuing, execution, or return of the commission, or if there are any defects in the deposition, or in short, if there is any objec- tion to it on other grounds than the irrelevancy of the testimony, or the incompetency or incredibility of a wit- ness, the proper remedy is by motion to suppress the deposition. (See Shleldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 267; Zcllieger v, Caffe, 5 Duer, 100; Union BankI of Sandusk7y v. Torrey, 5 Duer, 626, 2 Abb. 269.)* The motion must be made before the trial, if with rea- sonable diligence it can be (ib.; see Jackson v. Hobby, 20 Johns. 362), and thus tlhe party who procured the com- mission will be enabled to cure any defects that may exist in the deposition by a new commission, or by a cor- rection of mere technical mistakes, before the trial. This is the rule of the New York Superior Court, and it is so plainly just that we think all the courts will, upon due consideration, sanction it. The omission to return a material part of the testimony *(Creamer v. Jackson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 413), so far as it maintains the con- trary, is a dictum, and not well considered.,403
Suppression of the deposition. Motion papers. of a witness is a ground for suppression. (Creamer v. Jac7son, sp. t., 4 Abb. 413.) So is any false practice with the witness, by which his testimony is moulded in a suspicious manner. (Ib.; see Commercial Bank of Peinn. v. Union Bank, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 203.) So is the want of an answer to a question (Smith v. Griffith, 3 Hill, 333; see Zelirweger v. Caffe, 5 Duer, 100; Dodge v. Israel, 4 Wash. C. C. 324), unless such question was waived, as it is, when counsel attend the execution of the commission, and do not insist upon it. (Brown v. Kimball, 25 Wend. 259.),If, by an amendment of the pleadings, the whole depo- sition becomes irrelevant to the new issue formed, it seems that a motion to suppress it would be proper. (Vincent v. Conklin, 1 E. D. Smith, 204.),A deposition cannot be suppressed on account of any error which does not vitiate the whole of it. (Commercial Bankt of PcnnG v. VUnion Bank, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 203.),Motioin pay)crs.]--The motion should be founded upon affidavits, when its grounds do not appear in the docu- meents returned. And even when they do thus appear, it will be expedient to anticipate by affidavits any possible answer to the arguments based upon the face of the papers. Thus, if the ground of the motion is the failure of the witness to answer one, or a part of one, of the interrogatories, it would be decidedly advisable to make affidavit that the moving party was not represented at the cxamination, or, if represented, that his counsel objected to the omission.,The motion must of course be made upon notice, which may be in the following form:,Â§ 272. Notice of motion to suppress deposition. [As in Â§ 38, ante, i. 412, asking] that the deposition of A. B. taken under a commission heretofore issued in this cause [with furrtherparticulars if more than one commission has been issued] 404

Rectification of execution. be suppressed. on the ground [state tlhe ground, or add] stated in the aflidavits annexed, and for such other [&c.] The motion may be opposed with or without affidavits; and where it cannot be successfully resisted altogether, it may nevertheless be possible to induce the court to send the papers back for correction, instead of suppressing them, and compelling the entire work to be done over again. (See Keeler v. Vanderpool, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 289; Creamer v. Jackson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 413.) The order when granted, should be as follows:,Â§ 273. Order suplressing deposition. [Ttle of cause.] [Caption.] On reading and filing [&c.] OBDEREI): That the deposition of C. D., taken under a coin- mission issued in this action, on the .... day of .......,18 ...., be suppressed, and be inadmissible as evidence in this cause; [with ...... dollars, costs of motion, to plaintiff.] It is advisable to serve a copy of this order upon the adverse party, but it can scarcely be necessary to do so (unless costs are allowed), as the production of the order on the trial would suffice to exclude the deposition. Nevertheless, as such a course might give the other party an excuse for a postponement, it is better to serve a copy. ART. 11.-Rectification of erroneous execution of the com-,mission. Either party may move, before the trial, to send back the commission to the commissioners, for the correction of any errors in its execution. Thus, where the party at whose instance it was issued, found that the commissioners had, under a misconception of their powers, examined witnesses not named in the commission, the papers were, on his motion, amended and returned to the commissioners for new execution. (seelor v. YVanerpool, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 289.),405
Rectification of execution. The deposition as evidence on the trial.,_________________________-Â£------------__________ __Ë So, on the other hand, where the commissioners have omitted to make a written return of their proceedings, the proper remedy of the adverse party is to move to send the papers back for correction. (See Creamer v. Jackson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 413.),When this motion is made by the party who applied for the commission, he should be careful not to ask for costs, as it is a favor to him, if granted. Even the ad- verse party, if he joined in the commission, should not ask for costs; but if he did not, he may.,ART. 12.--Te deposition as evidence on the trial. The depositions taken under a commission issued, exe cuted and returned as heretofore prescribed, or an exem- plification thereof when the originals are filed in a county other than that in which the cause is tried, may be used as evidence on the trial by either party (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 677; [2 id. 396]); and this even though the witnesses thus examined are in the state at the time of the trial. (Phenix v. Baldwiin, 14 Wend. 62.),The judge at the trial cannot go behind the commission, and require proof that it was regularly issued. (Halleran v. Field, 23 Wend. 38.) And in the absence of proof of fraud and surprise, the commission and accompanying papers are presumed to be regular and properly con- nected. (Ib.),In every respect it will be presumed that the commis- sioner (Hall v. Barton, 25 Barb. 274; Williams v. El dridge, 1 Hill, 249) and clerk (Whitney v. Wyncoop, 4 Abb. 370) have done their duty.,When the place of trial was changed, and a commission was afterwards issued, which was returned, pursuant to the directions given with it, to the clerk of the original trial county, it was held that, it not appearing affirm- tively that the place of trial was changed on account of its not being the proper county, it would be presumed 406
The deposition as evidence on the trial. Second commission. that the direction and return were correct. (Whitney v. gVyncoop, 4 Abb. 370.) Objections to the evidence.]-Every objection to the com- petency or credibility of a witness thus examined, or to the competency or relevancy of any question put to him, or answer given by him, may be made in the same man- ner and with like effect as if he was personally examined at the trial. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 677; [2 id. 396].) No other objections ought to be allowed at the trial, if there has been time to raise them, by motion, before. (Union Bank v. Torrey, 5 Duer, 726; 2 Abb. 269; see ZelTleger v. Caffe, 5 Dner, 100.) The trial is the proper place to object to interrogatories as leading (Fleming v. Hollenback, 7 Barb. 271), and they should be excluded, though allowed by the judge on the settlement (ib.), or settled under a stipulation saving all legal objections (Williams v. Eldridge, 1 Hill, 249; but see Cope v. Sibley, 12 Barb. 521), unless admitted, as they may be, in the exercise of the discretion of the court. (lall v. Barton, 25 Barb. 274; Cope v. Sibley, supra.) An objection to an answer as not responsive to the inter- rogatory, may properly be raised at the trial. (Lansing v. Coley, 13 Abb. 272.) If the parties, before the trial, stipulate as to what objections shall be reserved for it, they are precluded from raising any others, as they are deemed to have waived them. (Morse v. Cloyes, 11 Barb. 101.)*,ART. 13.-Second, commission. A second commission is sometimes allowed, but this is discretionary with the court. Thus, where a jury were unable to agree, and were discharged, the court allowed a second commission to examine the same witnesses as on the first, it appearing to the court that their testimony,* Reversed on other grounds, 5 Seld. Notes, 12. _ ______ __,407
Second commission. When allowed. could decide some doubtful points. (Fisher v. Dale, 17 Johns. 343.) And where the examination of a witness incidentally disclosed a fact to which inquiry had not been directed, a new commission was allowed for the elucidation of that fact. (Nichol v. Columbian Ins. Co, 1 Caines, 345.) And a witness having died before he could be examined, a new commission was allowed to make the same inquiries of other witnesses, as the court would not amend the first commission by inserting new names. (M' Yic7ar v. Woolcot, 3 Caines, 321.) A witness having been examined on commission while incompetent to testify, a second commission was allowed to re-examine him, he having meanwhile become competent. (Washing- ton Ban7d v. Palmer, 2 Sands. 686.),But a new commission cannot be allowed for the mere pupl)ose of enabling a witness to put his testimony into better shape, and to make it more explicit, there being no suggestion of a mistake on his part, or of his having learned new facts. Certainly such a re-examination will not be allowed when the only other witness, cognizant of the facts, is dead. (lLancy v. Weed, sp. t., 1 Barb. 220.),Newly discovered evidence, fraud, surprise or mistake, may justify the issuing of a new commission. Indeed it ought to be granted as freely as a first commission, when applied for in good faith and with due diligence. But if its necessity is caused by the applicant's own delay or negligence, he ought to have no stay of proceedings. 408
When parties may be examined.,CHAPTER XC. BXAMINATION OF PARTIES BEFORE TRIAL, UNCONDITIONALLY.,AnTicLB 1. When parties may be examined.,2. Mode of procuring attendance of a party. 3. Proceedings on refusal to attend or testify. 4. The examination; how taken and used. ART. 1.-When parties may be examined. The examination of parties is in general regulated by the same rules as that of any other witnesses. (See ante, p. 356.) But their examination before the trial is subject to one or two peculiar rules, which will be noticed here. Any party to an action may be examined as a witness, by an adverse party, at any time before the trial (Code, 5 391), after issue has been joined, but not before (Watson v. Gage, 12 Abb. 215; Suydam v. Suydam, sp. t., 11 How. 518; Chichester v. Clichester, 3 Sands. 718; Code Rcp. N. 8. 108; Balbiani v. Grasheim, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 75), unless the examination is had under the statute providing for conditional examinations, in which case it will be sub- ject to all the rules concerning such depositions. (Watson v. Gage, supra.) Any party to the record may be thus examined, even though he is merely a nominal party, e. g., the president of a joint stock company, the action being really against the company. (Woods v. De Figaniere, 16 Abb. 1.) A person for whose immediate benefit an action is prose- cuted or defended, may be examined in the same manner s an actual party to the action. (Code, Â§ 396.) No per- 9on can be considered as within this description unless his relation to the action is such that he is substantially aparty, so that he can control the prosecution or defense. (Bridges v. Hyatt, 16 N. Y. 546; see Catlin v. Hansen, 1Duer, 309.) The examination of an adverse party may be claimed m a matter of right, either at or before the trial. (Cook v.,52
When parties may be examined. Procuring attendance of a party. Bidwce77, 17 Abb. 300; Green v. Wood, 6 Abb. 277; 6Duer, 702; 15 How. 338; Leeds v. Brown, sp. t., 5 Abb. 418.),The court has no discretion as to his examination at the trial, and it is doubtful whether it has any power to pre- vent his examination before the trial (ib.), but if it has, a substantial reason nmust be given for refusing to allow such an examination (Green v. Wood, supra), and a stipu. lation on the part of the adverse party for his attendance on the trial is not a sufficient reason for such refusal. (Ib.),It is not necessary, in order to entitle a party to the examination of his adversary before trial, that the latter should be sick, or about to leave the state. (Suydam v. Sluydamn, sp. t., 11 How. 518; see Watson v. Gage, 12 Abb. 215.) But if a party is examined conditionally or on com- mission, it must be under the same circumstances and rules as in the case of any other witness. (Code, Â§ 390, 399; see WVatson v. Gage, supra.),No bill of discovery is now allowed, nor can a party be examined hi any different manner from any other witness, except as stated in this chapter. (Code, Â§ 389.),By whom examination may be required.]-The examina- tion described in this chapter may be had at the instance of the adverse party, or any one of several adverse parties. (Code, Â§ 390.) ART. 2-Mode of procuring the attendance of a party for,examination before trial. Notice.]-In order to procure the attendance of a pIrty under this mode of proceeding, notice of his examination must be served upon him and all other adverse parties, at least five days before it takes place, unless, for good cause shown, the judge before whom it is to be had, shorten the time by order. (Code, Â§ 391.) . The notice should specify the judge before whom, and the time and place at which the examination is to be had. (See Garighe v. Losche, sp. t., 6 Abb. 284, n..; 14 How. 451)
It may be in the following form:,Â§ 274. Notice of exanmilnation. [ale of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that A. B.

No affidavit is necessary to authorize the judge to issue this summons. (Woods De .Figaniere, 16 Abb. 1.) For the form of this summons, and the mode of service, eepost, chap. xci., art. 3. It is not necessary to serve the summons with the notice, though it is usual to do so, and is indeed for the advant- age of the party desiring the examination.,EXAMINATION OF PARTIES BEFORE TRIAL. 411
Procuring attendance. Order. Proceedings on refusal to attend. Order.]-No order is necessary, unless the time of notice is shortened.* (Draper v. Henningsen, sp. t., 1 Bosw. 614; Gariglhe v. Losche, sp. t., 6 Abb. 284 nl.; 14 How. 451; Taggard v. Gardne, 2 Sands. 669; 2 Code Rep. 82.) And if an order for that purpose is granted, it should be kept distinct from the summons, inasmuch as it must be served on all adverse parties.,ART. 3.-Proceedings on refusal to attend or testify. Upon the neglect of a party duly summoned, to attend, two courses are open to the party aggrieved. lie may insist upon and compel attendance, or he may simply proceed for the punishment of the recusant, as hereafter stated.,Compelling attendanice.]-The attendance of the partyto be examined may be compelled, in the same manner as on a conditional examination (Code, Â§ 392), that is by warrant, as set forth post, chap. xci., art. 3. (Garighe v. Losehe, sp. t., 6 Abb. 284 n.; 14 How. 451; Bleecker v. Carroll, sp. t., 2 Abb. 82.),Penalty for refusal.]-A refusal to attend or testify may be punished as a contempt, and the pleadings of the recu- sant party may be stricken out. (Code, Â§ 394.) ART. 4.-TThe examination; where and howl taken and used.,Wlicre.]-The party to be examined cannot be required to attend in any county except that in which he resides, or in which he is served with the summons. (Code, Â§ 391.),Before whom.]-The examination must be had before a judge of the court in which the action is brought, or the county judge of the county in which he is examined. (lb.) * The contrary rule is enforced by the judges of the Supreme Court, first district, though the point has not been passed upon at a general term. See, however, Cook v. Bidwell (17 Abb. 300), which perhaps changes, the practice.
gEamination of party before trial. Compelling attendance at the trial. _-- - . How conducted.]-The examination must be conducted, taken and filed in precisely the same manner as a condi- tional examination. (Code, Â§ 392; People v. Dyckmalt, 24 llow. 222.) For the mode of proceeding, therefore, see ante, It is in substance a cross-examination, and to be gov- erned by similar rules. (Plato v. Kelly, 16 Abb. 188.) The pariy examined may be compelled to produce, on the ex- amination, books and documents, in the same manner as a witness upon the trial of the cause. (Brett v. Bucknam, 32 Barb. 655; per DA.LY, J., 2llarilosa Co. v. Garrison, -s., April, 1864.) There is a decision to the contrary (Woods v. DeFigaitiere, sp. t., 16 Abb. 159), but it seems to us clearly erroneous.,How used.]-The deposition may be read by either party at the trial (Code, Â§ 392), and as there is no restric- tion placed upon its use, as there is in the case of a conditional examination, it may be put in evidence, not- withstanding the party examined appears and testifies at the trial,CHAPTER XCL POCURINQ TUI AITENDANCE OF WITNESSES.,AnRTciE 1. Compelling attendance at the trial.,2. Compelling attendance with documents. 3, Compelling attendanee before trial. 4. Compelling attendance of prisoner. ART. L-Compelling atteutdalee at the trial. It is always expedient to put every material witness under a legal obligation to attend the trial, even though he is friendly, as such a proceeding costs very little trouble, and, as will be seen hereafter, it is indispensable, in case of the absence of the witness from the trial, when a postponement is sought. (Deas v. Smith, 1 Caines, 171.) This is done by means of a writ of subp2tna (so called
Compelling attendance at the trial. The subpoen* from the old Latin form of the writ, which commanded attendance sub paEna, &c.), if the witness is free within the state, or a writ of habeas corlpus ad testificandtlm, if he is a prisoner.,There are no means of compelling a witness to come to the trial from another state or country, though a resident of any state may be subpenaed while passing through this state. and will be punished for non-attendance if he can ever be found here.,Witnesses may be compelled to attend before a referee by the same process as that by which they are compelled to attend in court. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 667; [2 id. 384].),Tlhe sutbalrua.]-Tle subpoena is a writ issuing of course, as an absolute right.,It must of course run in the name of the people, and must be attested with the name of a judge of the court, and also of its clerk, and subscribed by the. party issuing it, or his attorney.,It is not now, as it formerly was, necessary that it should be sealed, and no mistake or omission in the attestation, or the name of the judge or clerk, vitiates it. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 282; Laws 1847, cd. 280.) The omission of the subscription of the attorney or party would, how- over, render it void. (See id.),The language of the statute is not sufficiently clear to enable us to decide whether the total omission of an attestation by a judge and clerk would be a defect of any importance, though we think it would not. It is obviously a mere question of form, since an attestation by "John Doe and Richard Roe " will suffice. And the omission is certainly amendable. An attestation in the name of any judge of the court is not only sufficient, but perfectly regular. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 282; Lawls 1847, ch. 280.) The attestation may also, with perfect regularity, be dated at any time. (lb.)
Compelling attendanco at trial. Subpoena. Service. Any number of names may be included in one writ. (1 Burr Pr. 222.)

Service.]-The sulpoena must be served on the witness personally, as follows: 1. The original writ must be shown to him; 2. A copy thereof, or a ticket containing its substance, must at the same time be delivered to him; 3. The fees allowed by law for traveling to and from the place where he is required to attend, and for one day's attendance, must at the same time be paid or tendered. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 683; [2 id. 400].) It is indispensable to a valid service, that the original writ should be shown to the witness. (Garden v. Creswell, 2Mees. & W. 319; Smith v. Truscott, 6 Man. & Gr. 267; Wadsworth v. Marshall, 1 Cr. & Mees. 87.) When to be served.]-The subpoena ought to be served before the day named in it as the time of trial, even though the cause is not actually tried at that time (Alex-
Compelling attendance at trial. Service of Bnbpcena. Fees on Eervice.,- - -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- andcr v. Dixon, 1 Bing. 366), but if served after that date, though before the actual trial, with an accompany. ing notice that there is time to reach the place of trial, the witness is bound to attend, if such notice is true. (Davies v. Lovell, 7 Dowl. . C. 178.),It must be served at a reasonable time before the day on which the witness is required to attend, so as to allow him sufficient time for traveling (Wilk7ie v. Chiaduick, 13 Wend. 49; Mainnsell v. Ainswvorth, 8 Dowl. P. 0. 869); and the question as to what is a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. (Maunsell v. Ainsworth, supra.),Fees on service.]-The fees allowed by law are fifty cents for each day's attendance, and if the witness resides more than three miles off the place of attendance, four cents a mile each way for traveling fees. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 922; [2 id. 643]; Lacs 1840, ch. 386.),'Therefore, fifty cents and the traveling fees must be paid upon service of the subpaona. These fees must be paid to the witness, and not to the husband (Havithibury v. Harvey, Cro. Eliz. 131) or guardian of the witness. They must be paid at the time of service, or they may be re- fused a i :rwards (Bowles v. Johnson, 1 W. Blacks. 36), and must be paid in full or the service is not binding (Hardv. Swian, 4 Denio, 75; C7hapman v.Pointon, 2 Strange, 1150; 13 East, 16 n.), provided the witness objects on that ground at the time, for otherwise he is considered to have waived the defect of payment (Goff v. Mills, 2 Dowl. & L. 23; Andrews v. Andrews, 2 Johns. Cas. 109; Goodwiv v. West, W. Jones, 430; Cro. Car. 522; see Woods v. De Figaniere, 16 Abb. 1),* though he does not lose his right to recover his fees, even though he refuses to testify on the trial on account of their non-payment. (Hallett v. .Mears, 13 East, 15.),* Hurd v. Swan (4 Denio, 75), is, however, directly to the contrary.
Attendance at trial. Fees. Duty of witness. Subsequent fees.]-A witness who attends from day to day may require his fees to be paid daily, and if they are refused, he is at liberty to go home. (Courtney v. Baker, 3 Denio, 27.) It has indeed been held that he is not bound to demand payment, but may leave as soon as the term for which he has been paid expires. (Hard v. Swan, 4 id. 75.) Fees to party]--A party to the action, if sulbponaed, is entitled to the usual fees, as much as any other witness (Hewlett v. Brown, sp. t., 7 Abb. 74; 1 Bosw. 655; Ander- son v. Johnson, sp. t., 1 Sands. 713; 1 Code Rep. 95.),Who liable for fees.]-The party who procures the sub- poena is the only person responsible for the fees (Watts v. Van 2iess, 1 Hill, 76; Andrews v. Bates, 5 Johns. 351); in the absence of an express promise by another as an induce- ment to attend. (See Euvans v. Phidlpotts, 9 Carr. & P]. 270.) Return offees.]-If the attendance of the witness is not required, he may be so i:formed, and unless he has actu- ally incurred expense or loss of time in obedience to the subpcena, he must repay what he received. (Mlartin v. Andrews, 7 Ell. & Bl. 1.) And though he makes the journey which the subpoena requires, yet if he makes it for a different purpose, and there is no trial, he cannot retain his traveling fees. (lb.) Duty of witness.]--A witness, on being subpoenaed, must use the most convenient and expeditious means of conveyance, and cannot limit his daily travel to any par- ticular number of miles. (Wilkic v. Chladwvick, 13 Wend. 49.) He must use the utmosst exertion to attend the trial, and mere inconvenience is no excuse for absence (Peolle v. Davis, 15 Wend. 602); nor is it a good excuse,-at any rate, in the case of a lawyer subpcenaed,-that he made a call on the way which he thought he had time to make,,53
Attendance at trial. Compelling attendance with docnment. but which in fact delayed him until it was too late. (Jackson v. Seagecr, 2 Dowl. & L. 13.),A witness can never be required to travel on Sunday (Willie v. C7adwick, 13 Wend. 49), and need not there. fore set out on his journey, if he cannot complete it without traveling on that day. (Ib.),We presume that the same rules apply to a regular public holiday, such as the 4th of July, new year's day, election days (where the witness is qualified to vote on such day), &c. AnT. 2.-CÃ³ompelling attendance at the trial with documents.,If it is desirable that the witness should be compelled to produce any documentary evidence at the trial, this can be done, if the document is in his possession, by means of a sulbpcea duces tecun. This subpoena is to be prepared and served in the same manner as the ordinary one.,Its form may be as follows:,Â§ 276. Suebpwna duces teceum. [As in Â§ 275, to the word "defendant," and continue] and also that you bring with you and produce in evidence [here (escribe the document as accurately as possible], and all other documents which you have under your control, concerning the premises. [Conclude as in Â§ 275.],Upon being duly served with this subpoena, in the man- ner heretofore stated, the witness is bound to produce the document required at the trial, and his mere attendance is not a sufficient compliance with the writ. (Lane v. Cole, 12 Barb. 680; Amey v. Long, 9 East, 472.),A party to the action, subpoenaed as a witness, may be compelled by this process to produce documents in his possession. (Mitcheli's case, 12 Abb. 249; People v. Dhjdc- man, 24 How. 222; Bonesteel v. Lynde, sp. t., 8 id. 226, overruling Trotter v. Latson, sp. t., 7 id. 261.)
. .~--- -- - Attendance with documents. Excuses for withholding. Excuses for withholding documents.]-The witness has a right to submit to the court any excuse which he may have for withholding the documents mentioned in the subpoena. But the court, and not the witness, is the judge of the sufficiency of the excuse. (See Amey v. Long, 9 East, 485; Pearson v. Fletcher, 5 Esp. N. P. 90.) Nor has the witness a right to have the question argued by his own counsel. (Doe v. Egremonot, 2 Moo. & R. 386; see Doe v. Date, 3 Q. B. 621.) An erroneous decision of the judge, in overruling a witness's privilege in this respect, is no ground for excep- tion or appeal by a party. (Doe v. Date, 3 Q. B. (09; Mlarsto, v. Downes, 1 Ad. & El. 34.) But an erroneous refusal to compel the production of a document may be reviewed (see Doe v. Date, 3 Q. B. 609), and so certainly may an improper compulsion of such production when the privilege appertains in fact to a party to the action and not to the witness. (See M'Plherson v. Rathbonc, 7 Wend. 216; Jackson v. Denison, 4 id. 558.) The fact that the document belongs to another person is no excuse if it is in the actual possession and control of the witness (Amey v. Long, 1 Campb. N. P. 14; 6 Esp. N. P. 116; Corsen v. Dubois, Holt N. P. 239), but if it is not really under his control, the rule is otherwise. Thus a clerk (Bank of Utica v. Hillard, 5 Cow. 158), or cashier of a bank (S. C., 5 Cow. 419), or clerk in a public office (Austin v. Evans, 2 Man. & Gr. 430), cannot be required to produce a document belonging to his principal without ihe consent of the latter. (lb.) Neither can the attorney or counsel of a party to the action be compelled by this process to produce documents with which he has been intrusted by his client (M'Plerson v. Rathbone, 7 Wend. 216; Jac7soat v. Denison, 4 id. 558; Jackson v. Burtis, 14 Johns. 399), or which were given to him by a third per- son for the use of his client. (Jackson v. Burtis, 14 Johns, 399.) The witness is not bound to produce a paper which
Attendance with documents. Excuses for withholding. contains matter which he would be privileged from testi. fying to on the ground of its tendency to criminate him.,A witness will not be compelled to produce a document upon which he has a lien for a debt overdue from the party asking its production. (Kemp v. King, 1 Carr. & . 396.),The immateriality of a document is not a sufficient excuse for withholding it. (Doe v. Kelly, 4 Dowl. P. o. 273.),Some English decisions in relation to title deeds (1 B. & C. 263; 8 iD. & . 726; 1 CalT. & P. 161; 7 M. & W. 102, and others), are inapplicable to this state, where title is matter of public record.,The originals of records which may by law be proved by certified copies, cannot be procured by this process. A special order of the court, made in open court and entered on the minutes, stating the production of such originals instead of the transcripts, to be necessary, is the only means of obtaining them. (1 R. 8. (5th ed.) 868; Laws 1838, ek. 129.),If the witness is intercepted by a party ad rse to the one who subpoenaed him, and is induced to give up the papers to him, secondary evidence may be given of their contents, without serving any notice to produce them (Leeds v. Cook, 4 Esp. N. P. 255), or the party who thus took the papers may be compelled to produce them by means of a subpoena. (Bonosteel v. Lynde, sp. t., 8 How. 226.),A witness may be required to produce documents, without being sworn (Summers v. Moseley, 4 Tyrwh. 158; 2 Or. & M. 477; Davis v. Dale, 4 Carr. & P. 335; Perry v. Gibson, 1 Ad. & E. 48); and, even though sworn, he cannot be cross-examined unless he gives evidence in chief. (See Rush v. Smlith, 1 CO. M. & P. 94; 4 Tyrwh. 675; Simpson v. Smith, cited 2 Cr. & M. 482.),A witness being sworn, and having a document in his possession, material to the cause, will be compelled to

How issued.]-This summons must be issued and signed by the judge before whom the witness is to be examined. (See 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 675, 682; [2 id. 393, 399].) Form.]-The summons should be substantially in the following form:,Â§ 277. Slummons to testify. You are hereby summoned to attend before me, at [dc.] on [&c.] to be examined as a witness [or, as a party] before trial, on behalf of the plaintiff [or, delendant], in an action between A.

And for a failure to attend [cCc., rus in Â§ 275, ante, p. 415].,Witness my hand [&c J.],[J 7ge's Signature.] Service and fees.-The mode of serving this summons, and the fees to be paid a party or witness therewith, are precisely the same as in the case of a subpoena. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 684; [2 id. 401].) See therefore ante, p. 415. Warrant.] -In case of the failure of a witness to attend after being duly summoned, the officer issuing the sum- mons, upon due proof of its service, and of the failure of the witness to attend, must issue his warrant to the sheriff to apprehend and bring him up for examination. (3 R. S. (5tt ed.) 684; [2 id. 401].)
Compelling attendance of a prisoner. Issuance of the writ,AnT. 4.-Compelling attendance of a prisoner. If a witness is in prison at the time his testimony is needed for any purpose, his attendance can be procured by a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, unless he is imprisoned under a sentence for felony. (3 R. 8. (oth ed,) 876; [2 id. 559].),By whom granted.]-This writ may be granted by the court, or by any justice of the Supreme Court, or by any officer authorized to perform the duties of such a justice. (Ib.),Mode of application.]-Though the statute does not expressly require it, yet we suppose it is usual to apply on petition. Such petition must be verified by affidavit, and must state:,1. The title and nature of the proceeding in regard to whicl the testimony of the prisoner is desired; and,,2. That his testimony is material and necessary to the party applying, on the trial or hearing of such proceeding, as such party is advised by counsel, and verily believes. But when the application is made by the attorney-general, or a district attorney, this clause is not necessary. (3 R. S. (5th edl.) 876; [2 id. 559].) This petition, or affidarit, must be made by a party to the action, or some good excuse for his absence must be given, in which case it might be made by his agent or attorney.,Issuance of the writ.]-The writ should be prepared and presented, with the petition, to the judge, who, if he grants it, must indorse it as " allowed," with the date of allowance (3 1. S. (5th eel.) 893; [2 id. 574]); and it must then be sealed by the clerk of the court in which it is returnable. (Ib.) It may be made returnable forthwith, or at any day named therein. (Ib.) It may be attested on any day, and in the name of any judge of the court (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 282; Laws 1847, ch. 280.)
Attendance of prisoner. The writ. Service of the writ. It should state in some form the purpose for which it is issued, and this may be most effectually done by stating that the prisoner is required " to testify," but these par- ticular words are not essential. (Wattles v. Marsh, 5 Cow. 176. And the sheriff or jailer must obey it, notwith- standing any formal defects which do not render it void. (lb.) Service of the writ.]-The writ must be served by an elector of some county in this state, who must deliver it to the person to whom it is directed, or, if he cannot be found, to any under officer or other person at the jail, having charge of the prisoner. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 893, 894; [2 id. 574].) The service is not complete until the party at whose instance the writ is issued gives a bond to the sheriff or jailer, in a penalty double the amount for which the prisoner is detained, if lie is detained for a specific sum of money, and if not, then in the penalty of $1,000, con- ditioned that he will pay the charges of carrying back the prisoner, and that the prisoner will not escape by the way, either going or returning, nor, except in the city of New York (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 895; Laws 1844, ch. 315), until he has paid the lawful fees for bringing up such prisoner (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 893; [2 id. 574]); which are $1.50 for bring- ing him up, 121 cents per mile each way (Utica Bank. v. Kibbe, 7 Cow. 424), for traveling, and one dollar per day, with necessary expenses, for attending in court with him. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 925; [2 id. 646].) The last fee is not perhaps payable in advance. The attorney-general and district attorneys need not pay any fees. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 894; [2 id. 574].) Upon the writ being thus served, the officer in whose custody the prisoner is must obey it, whether it is directed to him or not. (Ib.)

A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between the parties, whether they are issues of law or of fact (Code, Â§ 252.)*,There cannot be any trial until issues have actually been formed (Pardee v. Scheinec, 11 How. 500; Cwaplnan v. Lemon, sp. t., id. 235); and, therefore, an assessment of damages on failure to answer is not a trial (Raniilollih v. Foster, sp. t., 4 Abb. 262; 3 E. D. Smith, 648), nor is an application to the court for judgment in like cases (Chap- mana v. Le2non, sp. t., 11 How. 235, 340), though the prac- tice is said to vary in this respect. (Yoorh. Code [6th ed.] 435 e.),A motion for judgment on a pleading as frivolous is not a trial, inasmuch as the question raised is not upon,* For an account of the various issues, and their formation, see ante, p. 166. 424

Jacobson, sp. t., 22 How. 470; Marquisee v. Brigham, sp. t., 12 id. 399; Roberts v. Clark, sp. t., 10 id. 451; Gould v. Carpenter, sp. t., 7 id. 97; see Wesley v. Bennett, sp. t., 6 Abb. 12.* And a motion to dismiss the complaint for want of progress in the action is not a trial, as the issues are not examined. (Tilspaugh v. Dick, sp. t., 8 How. 33.) ,The regular argument of a demurrer is, of course, a trial. (Small v. Ludlow, 1 Hilt. 307.) ART. 2.-When and nj whonm the action may be brought to,trial. W hen.]--The action must not be brought to trial until all]the defendants, whose presence is necessary to a proper decision of the cause, have been served with the sum- mons or have appeared in the action (Morris v. Craw- ford, 16 Abb. 124; Powell v. Finch, 5 Duer, 666; see Shaver v. Brainard, 29 Barb. 25); nor until they have all answered, or their time for answering has expired (Ward v. Dewey, sp. t., 12 How. 193; see Morris v. Crawford, supra); nor until it is in a situation for final judgment between all the parties. (See Ward v. Dewey, supra; Burnham v. De Bevoise, sp. t., 8 How. 159.) It is unadvisable to bring on the trial until the time allowed for parties to amend their pleadings has expired: it is not necessary (Cusson v. Whalon, sp. t., 5 How. 302); and in case of an amendment made after notice of trial, the notice would be useless. (Morgan v. Leland, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 123; see Washburn v. Herrick, sp. t., 4 How. 15; Shultyis v. Owens, 14 Johns. 345; Hawley v. Hanchett, 1 Cow. 152.)

fact, without waiting for a decision upon the demurrer. (Palmer v. Smedley, sp. t., 13 Abb. 185.),By whomn.]-An action may be brought to trial by any party thereto, who has given notice of trial (Code, Â§ 258); provided he is the sole party plaintiff or defendant. (Ward v. Dewcey, sp. t., 12 How. 193.) And even if he is not such sole party, yet the court may, in its discretion, permit any single party, who has given notice, to bring the action to trial. (Gurnce v. Hoxie, 29 Barb. 547.),ART. 3.-Preference of issues. Certain causes are by law given a preference upon the calendar. Thus, actions against corporations upon their notes or other pecuniary obligations are to be preferred (3 R. S. (5th7 ed.) 756; [2 id. 459]); and so are actions brought by the attorney-general. (Laws 1848, i. 582; Laws 1850, eh. 128; Laws 1858, c7. 37.),Apart from these exceptional cases, the court has entire control over the calendar, and may give preference to any issue over others of the same species, which, however, it rarely does, unless by way of restoring a cause to a place which it has accidentally lost.,As between issues of fact and of law, the court is obliged, from motives of convenience, to give a preference. The Code contains two sections upon the subject, which are directly in conflict with each other. Â§ 255 prefers issues of law, and Â§ 257 issues of fact. This is the result of an amendment to Â§ 255, enacted in 1852, and that, being the latest enactment on the subject, carries as we think, the greatest weight, notwithstanding it left the inconsistent provision of Â§ 257 unnoticed. As both sections unite in giving the court control over the whole subject, their incongruityin theformer respect is of little real importance.,Where there are issues of law and of fact joined in one action, the issue of law must be first tried, unless the court otherwise directs (Code, Â§ 251), and it is not necws 426,TRIAL IN GENERAL.

If an issue of fact is tried before an issue of law in the same action, it will be presumed, in the absence of any objection at the trial, to have been so tried by direction of the court. (Fry v. Bennett, 9 Abb. 50; Warner v. Wigers, 2 Sands. 635.),There is good reason for giving a preference to an issue of law over an issue of fact in the same action. On deciding the former, it is usual for the court to allow the unsuccessful party to plead anew, and thus to raise a new issue of fact. If, therefore, a previous trial has been had upon an earlier issue of fact, the number of trials would be unnecessarily increased.,ART. 4.-Howu issues are to be tried. Issues of law.]-Issues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred. (Code, Â§ 253.),Issues of fact.]-An issue of fact in any action which was formerly known as a common law action must, under the Constitution of this state, be tried by a jury, unless a jury is waived, or a long account is involved. (Fire Depart- ment v. Harrison, 9 Abb. 1; 2 Hilt. 455.) Though the Code prescribes a narrower limit for jury trials, it is uncon- stitutional in that respect. (Ib.),The actions in which a jury trial is thus a matter of right are: 1. Actions for the recovery of money only; 2. For the recovery of specific real or personal property; 3. For divorce on the ground of adultery (Code, Â§ 253); 4. So; the abatement of a nuisance, and the recovery of damages or a penalty, no injunction or other equita- ble relief being demanded. (Fire Department v. Harrison, 2 Hilt. 455; 9 Abb. 1.)* * The judgment in this case takes no notice of Van Bergen v. Van Bergen, (2 Johns. Ch. 272), in which on the authority of Coulson v. White (3 Atk. 21,) East Iid. Co. v. Vincent (2 id. 83), the abatement of a nuisance is recognized as a branch of equitable jurisdiction, concurrently with law.,427.
How issues are to be tried. Waiver of right to jury,,I---- - ~~~~~~~~~~------ In some respects the Code extends the right of a jury trial to new cases. Thus, an action on an agreement to insure, brought after a loss has occurred, though essen. tially an equitable action, yet requiring a judgment for money only, is triable by jury (Rockwell v. Hartford Ils. Co., sp. t., 4 Abb. 179); and so, perhaps, is an action to compel the surrender of a chattel, though not demanding judgment in the usual form. In the equitable action for this purpose, however, an injunction is almost invariably demanded, and in such case, it is tried by the court.,The issues in every other action are triable by the court (Code, Â§ 254); which may, however, order the whole issue, or any specific question of fact involved therein, to be tried by a jury, or may refer it, as provided here. after. (Id.) But this must be done, if at all, before the cause has been actually tried by the court. (O'Brien v. Bowes, 4 Bosw. 657; 10 Abb. 206.),As to when a trial by the court must be suspended, to be brought before a jury, see post, chap. xciv., art. 1.,Waiver of right to jury.]-Actions properly triable by a jury, may be tried before a judge without a jury in the following cases:,1. Where one of the parties fails to appear at the trial, and the others do not ask a jury;,2. Upon the written consent of the parties or their attorneys, filed with the clerk;,3. Upon their oral consent, in open court, entered upon the minutes. (Code, Â§ 266.),By going to trial without objection, the parties waive the right to claim a different form of trial. Thus, if they so proceed to trial without a jury, they cannot afterwards object on that account, although they might be entitled to a jury (Greason v. Keteltas, 17 N. Y. 491; aff'g. S. 0. sub. nom. Newcombe v. Keteltas, 19 Barb. 608), and in like manner, after proceeding to trial by a jury, without objection, neither party can avail himself of the fact that 428
Selarate trials between different parties. How ordered. the court had no power to summon a jury. (Dayharsh v. Elos, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 531.) ART. 5.-Separate trials between different parties to one,action. A separate trial between a plaintiff and any of several defendants may be allowed by the court whenever, in its opinion, justice will thereby be promoted. (Code, Â§ 258.) But the discretion conferred by this clause of the Code is, in effect, limited by Â§ 274 to cases in which a several judgment would be proper. And AIr. Van Santvoord, with justice, considers that there can be very few actions other than for money, land, or chattels only, in which separate trials could properly be allowed. (ranS Santr. Eq. Pr. 466; and see Cobb v. Thornton, sp. t., 8 How. 66.) It is not absolutely necessary that there should be any formal order for this purpose. The judge, at circuit or trial term, may, in his discretion, permit separate trials to be had. (Gurnee v. Hoxie, 29 Barb. 547.) Nevertheless, it is better to apply for a separate trial, if it is desired, in a more formal manner, and at the special term (see Ward v..Dcewey, sp. t., 12 How. 193), especially as the judge at circuit would most properly give the benefit of every doubt to the party.opposed to the application for a separate trial. If the application is addressed to the special term, it should be made upon the same notice and in the same manner as other motions. For forms of notice of motion and order, see ante, i. 412, 422.,429

If the action is one in which a trial by jury is a matter of right, no order of the court, and therefore no applica- tion, is necessary for the purpose of securing such trial.,If it is not of right triable by jury, yet the court may order the whole issue, or any specific question of fact, to be tried by a jury. (Code, Â§ 254.)
When such an order is desired, notice of motion there- for must be served within ten days after issue joined. The motion is made upon the pleadings, and with the notice must be served a copy of the questions of fact proposed to be submitted to the jury, in proper form to be incorporated in the order; and the court or judge may settle the issues, or refer them to a referee for settlement. (Rule 33, Supreme Ct.) It is in the discretion of the court to grant or refuse this order. (See Churclh v. Freeman, sp. t., 16 How. 294; Apthorle v. Constock, 2 Paige, !82.) And it may, in a case which seems eminently proper for the consideration of a jury, allow the motion to be made after the lapse of the ten days fixed by the rule. (Clark v. Brooks, sp. t., 26 How. 285.) The court is not prevented by Rule 33 from referring the cause to a jury, without any formal motion, when it comes on for trial (see O'Brien v. Bowes, 4 Bosw. 657; 10 Abb. 206; Cltrc7h v. Freeman, sp. t., 16 How. 294; Clnrk v. Brooks, sp. t., 26 How. 285; New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Dudley, 8 Paige, 452); and it has been said that it is better to leave the motion to be made when the cause comes on for trial (Church v. Freeman, supra); but this is contrary to the spirit of Rule 33, and objectionable also as leaving the settlement of the issues to the time of trial, when they cannot receive proper attention, unless they are very simple. The order, if granted, must state distinctly and plainly the questions of fact to be tried (Code, Â§ 72); and such order is the only authority necessary for a trial. (Id.) Divorce.] -In an action for divorce, when issue is joined upon the question of adultery, the issue to be tried must be settled in the same manner as in actions in which a jury trial is obtained as a favor, before the cause is tried by a jury. (Rule 33, Slupreme Ct.) If the action is tried in any other manner, the issues need not be settled.,431 TRIAL BY JUBY.

Form of the issztes.]-Each issue should be stated in the form of an interrogatory, in such manner, if possible, that the jury can answer simply, " Yes" or No.",AIT. 2.-Notice of trial. Notice of trial must be given in all cases, even though the cause may have been set down for a particular term or day by consent (Ifield v. Weeks, 1 H. Blacks. 222), or by special order of the court. (Jacks v. SMiayer, 8 T. R. 245; see Ellis v. Trizsler, 1 W. Blacks. 798.),By whom given.]-Either party may give notice of the trial. (Code, Â§ 256.) But on the part of the defendant this is only a privilege, and not a duty; while it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to give prompt notice, and to bring the cause to trial; a duty enforced by dismissing his com. plaint in case of his unreasonable neglect to do so. (See ante, p. 336.),To whiom given.]-Notice of trial is not required to be given to any but the adverse party on the record. A defendant is not bound to give notice to a co-defendant, even when their interests are adverse. (Semble, Gurnee v. Hoxie, 29 Barb. 547.),When giren.]--The notice may be given at any time after issue, but at least fourteen days before the term of the court commences (Code, Â§ 256), except where the service is by mail, in which case, notice must be given at least sixteen days before the dlay of trial, including the day of service. (Code, Â§ 412.),The defendant may serve notice of trial with his answer; but if it contains a counterclaim, the plaintiff will nevertheless have it in his power to nullify the notice, by serving a reply, after which notice must be given anew.,In like manner the plaintiff may serve notice of triai with his reply, subject to the risk of the defendant's 432,TRIAL BY JURY.

And on either side the effect of a notice of trial, served witlin 20 days after issue joined, nmay be destr-oyed by an amendlmclnt of the pleadlings mlade( in good faith within that timle. (3Iorg)a v. Le7lad, sp. t., 1 Code Rcl). 123; see lfaslburnL v. ITvrrick, sp. t., 4 How. 15; Ctsson v. Wt7le(on, sp. t., 5 1 !w. 302.) The 1pl)intiff mnay, there- fore, very properly . -serve his notice of trial until the time for demurring to or amending the pleadings is past. (Cussot v. Whalon, supra.) If either party has moved to amend or strike out the whole or a part of the pleading of tlle adverse party, he cannot notice the cause for trial while such motion, or an appeal from the decision thereon, is pending. (Truistees of Penlln Ya v. Sorbes, sp. t., 8 How. 285.) Of course, no notice of trial can be served with effect, while a stay of proceedings is in force, and the defendant cannot, therefore, notice the cause for ten days after making an offer to compromise. (Walker v. Jo7hnson, sp. t., 8 low. 240.) Nor can the cause be noticed for trial after the death of one of the parties, until it has been properly revived. (See Jarvis v. Felc7, sp. t., 14 Abb. 46.) The notice.]-Notices of trial are subject to tile same rules as other notices. (See ante, i. 434.) Unless an affidavit of merits has been filed by the defendant, or unless he sets up a counterclaim alone as his defense (Potter v. Smith, sp. t., 9 How. 262), the plain- tiff may take an inquest, that is, he may take up the the cause out of its order on the calendar, and have it disposed of in a sunmmarv manner. (Rule 29, Sup(remje Ct.) But lie cannot do this unless, in his notice of trial, he,55,433 TRIAL BY JURY.
Notice of trial. Form and contents of notice. has expressed his intention to take an inquest. (Ib.) It is therefore usual to express such an intention in all notices of trial by jury.,In the Yew York Superior Court, either party, at the time of giving notice of trial, and, we presume, as part of the same, lmay also give notice that he will move on the first day of the term for ju(dgent on the pleadings alone, with or without such admissions as he may specify; and may bring on the cause accordingly. (Ante, i. 229.),Where there is more than one cause pending between the salme parties, one of which (only is noticed for trial, the notice must specify which cau.-e is to be tried. (Lis7ier v. Parmele, 1 Wend. 22.),In determining the sufficiency of the notice, the court will inquire whether the party has really been misled by any defect complained of. (Bander v. Covill, 4 Cow. 60; see Dotuw v. Rice, 11 Wend. 178.) Thus, a notice for the third Monday, instead of the third Tuesday, where the party was not misled, was held sufficient for the latter day. (Bander v. Covill, 4 Cow. 60; S. P., N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. Kelsey, sp. t., 13 H-ow. 535.) A notice for "the 4th ----day of April," instead of the 4th Monday of April, is sufficient to inform him that the cause would be brought to trial at the April circuit, and is therefore good, especially when the party served does not return it. (Silliman v. Clark, sp. t., 2 How. 160.) So where a notice was for the right day of the month, hbt the day of the week was stated incorrectly. (Wolfe v. Iorton, 3 Cai. 86.) And so where the notice was for the circuit in the county generally, without naming the time or place. (Jac7son v. Brownson, 4 Cow. 51.) A mere misnomer of one of the parties, e. g.-giving Jeunis for Tennis-was held suffi- cient, the party served not being misled. (Quick v. Mer- rill, 3 Cai. 133.),In all such cases of obvious errors, it is the duty of the party served to return the notice to the party serving it, if he intends to rely on the fact of the defect. (N.

[Date and address.] [Sigiatuie.] 1ileewintg notiee.]-A new notice of trial must ie served before every circuit, until the cause is tried, for it cannot be tried at any circuit for which it is not specially noticed; except in actions triable in the city of New York, in which only one notice and one note of issue are neces- sary, after which the cause remains on the calendar until disposed of. (Code, Â§ 256.) A notice for a particular circuit, and that if not then tried, the c i'se would be continued on the calendar, from circuit to c*tcuit, until tried, is of no avail for any sub- sequent circuit. (Beek7cmaL v. Reed, 5 Cow. 23.) A notice, however, may be served for a subsequent circuit, before the close of the circuit at which the cause was noticed and put on the calendar, though a reservation should be inserted to the effect that the notice is to take effect only in case the cause is not tried at the present circuit. (Faulkner v. Mayor &c. of Brooklyn, sp. t., 2 How. 151; approved, Carpenter v. Tuffs, sp. t., id. 166.) Countermanding notice.]-No provision is made by the Code for countermanding a notice of trial, but there is nothing in it prohibitory of such a proceeding. The old practice therefore remains in force (Code, Â§ 469), and under that, the party giving such notice may counter- mand it by a notice in writing, served in the usual,435 TRIAL BY JURY.

[D]te and ((I.nidS.] [Sigt(tulre.],The other party is entitled to all the costs which he has actually incurred in preparing for trial, between the service of notice of trial and notice of countermand. (2 R. S. 618, Â§ 36.) Payment of these costs could formerly be enforced by an interlocutory order (1 B'frr. Pr. 214); and perhaps this may still be done, or, in case of their non-lpaymilent, an order may be obtained setting aside the countermand.,ART. 3.-Placing the cause on, the calendar. The notice of trial informs the adverse party that the cause is to be tried, but is not sufficient to inform the court of the fact. For that purpose a note of issue miust be filed, and a calendar of causes prepared.,A notice of trial is entirely unavailable, unless the cause is placed on the calendar. (Brown ing v. Paige, sp. t., 7 How. 487.),Note of issue.]-The party giving the notice of trial must furnish the clerk of the court, at least eight days before the opening of the court, with a note of the issue. (Code, Â§ 256.),This note of issue must state the title of the action, the names of the attorneys, and the time when the last plead- ing was served (id.); and it is obviously advisable to state also the nature of the issue, as whether of law or of fact, 436
placing cause on calendar. Note of issue. Calendar. and if of fact, whether to be tried with or without a jury. Such a statement is required by positive rules in all the courts in the city of Nvew York. It is also desirable (and has been sometimes required) that tle note of issue should state by what party it is filed. Preferred causes should be so distinguished on the note of issue! It is best to file the note of issue as soon as possible after serving notice of trial ; for where an attorney was suddenly iaken ill on the last day for filing a note of issue, and the filing was thereby delayed three (lays, the court refused to place the cause on the calendar, on the ground that the attorney ought not to have left this duty to the last moment.

Calendar.]-From the notes of issue filed with him, the clerk of the court prepares a calendar, in which causes are numbered according to their date of issue, and which regulates the order in which causes are tried. Where there are several issues of the samie date, they are entitled to priority according to the time when the notes of issue are filed. (1 Burr. Pr. 228.) Under the former practice, causes were placed on the calendar according to the first issue joined in an action (Griswold v. Stewart, 3 Cow. 16), but under the Code, it seems to follow, from the language of Â§ 256, that the last issue furnishes the date for the calendar.,437
Calendar. , Preferences. Correcting calendar. Prefercnces.] -Every action to which the people of the state are a party, and in which the attorney-general is the attorney on record, is entitled to a preference over all others, upon the attorney-general giving notice, at the time oi sorvice of notice of trial or argument, of the day upon which he will move for the trial or argument of the action. Upon the day thus specified, either the peo- ple or the defendant may move for trial or argument, but not on any other day, unless by direction of the court. (Laws 1858, oh. 37.),Next to such cases, actions against a corporation upon notes or other instruments for the absolute payment of money only, are entitled to a preference. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 756; [2 id. 459].) This enactment is still in force. (Ct. of Appeals, Brainard v. N. . & Harlemn R. R. Co., 23 How. 491.) An action upon a policy of insurance is not entitled to a preference under this statute. (Anon., 6 Cow. 41.),Actions to which the commissioners of pilots in the city of New York are parties, are preferred in all courts except the Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals. (Laws 1853, ch. 412.),Other preferences (see Laws 1850, 200; Laws 1854, 606), are practically obsolete, besides being included under the statute of 1858.,Correcting calendar.]--If any error is perceived in the calendar, application must be made to the circuit, or other branch of the court in which the trial is to be had, for its correction. No other branch of the court will interfere with it. (North v. Sargeant, sp. t., 14 Abb. 223; Allen v. Calhoun, 6 Cow. 32.),Motions to correct the calendar are usually heard at the opening of the court, before causes are called. (1 Van sSaantv. Eq. Pr. 462.),Rules in New York city.]-The calendars being pre- pared on a different principle in the city of New York, 438
Caleudara. Rules in New York city. Short calendars. from that which prevails in the rest of the state, certain peculiar rules are provided in relation to causes triable there. Only one notice of trial, and one note of issue are required in New York, after which the cause rema ns onthe calendar until disposed of (Code, Â§ 256); though at the end of every year, for the purpose of clearing the calendars, the courts in that city require a fresh note of issue to be filed, as an evidence that the cause is actually on foot. This annual note of issue is required to state the number of the cause on the last calendar, and if the cause has been marked down during the year, it must state when it was so marked, which forms the date of issue on the new calendar. If these rules are not com- plied with, the cause will be dropped from the calendar.,When a cause, placed on the calendar of a court of record in New York city, is regularly called and passed, without a postponement by the court for good cause shown, it is thereafter entered on the calendar as dating issue from that time (Ante, i. 221; Laws of 1849, 708), and the party placing the cause on the calendar for a subsequent term, must state the date of the issue accord- ingly; and if he omits to do so, by reason whereof the cause retains its priority on the calendar, the court may, on application of the adverse party, or of its own motion, strike the cause from the calendar. (lb.),ART. 4.-Short calendars. In order to expedite the trial of actions in which there is no substantial defense, the courts in the first and second judicial districts have provided a special calendar for the trial of short causes. The rules of the courts concerning this short or "railroad" calendar, as it is often called, being somewhat different in details, although nearly uni- form in substance, we state them separately.,439
Suprelme Court, City of New York-.]-At any circuit of this court, any causes belonging to either of the two fol. lowing classes may be placed on a special circuit calendar, unless the trial is likely to occupy more than one hour:,1. Where the action is on contract, and the answer merely denies the allegations in the complaint, without setting up any new matter;,2. Where the action is on contract, and new matter is set up in the answer, and there is reason to believe that the defense is made only for the purpose of delay.,To entitle the cause to be placed on such calendar, the plaintiffs' attorney must give notice four days before any Monday in tlie circuit, that he will move on such Monday to have the cause placed on such calendar; and the mo. tion will be heard on such Monday, and, if granted, the cause may be heard on the following Friday. If the mo. tion is founded on the belief that the defense is for delay, affidavits must be served at the time of notice.,The plaintiff's attorney must also deliver to the clerk of the circuit a like notice four days before such Friday, containing also the number of the cause on the general circuit calendar.,The same motion may be made on any day before the judge at chambers on notice of four days.,If the cause actually occupies more than one hour on the trial, the trial may be suspended at the discretion of the court, and the same be put down at the foot of the calendar. (Ante, i. 220.),Supreme Court, Second District.]-The following rule was adopted in this district, Oct. 24, 1856:,"At each circuit to be held after the first day of Janu- ary, A.

Short calendars. Affidavit of merits. When to be made. Should the trial occupy more than one hour, it may be suspended, in dhe discretion of the judge holding the court, and the cause will thereupon be placed at the foot of the general calendar, unless otherwise specially ordered.,ART. 5.-Affidavit of merits. Necessity.]-In common law actions, it is necessary to make, file and serve an affidavit of merits on the part of the defendant in order to prevent the plaintiff from tak- ing an inquest, a proceeding explained in our next chap- ter. (Riule 29, Supreme Ct.; Anderson v. Hough, 1 Sands. 721; 1 Code Rep. 50; Jones v. Russell, sp. t., 3 How. 324; lode Rep. 113; Sheldon v. Martin, sp. t., id. 81.) A verified answer does not supply the place of an affidavit of merits for this purpose. (Ib.) An inquest was allowed by rule of court in all common law actions, in 1808 (see 3 Johns. 542), and no subsequent rule appears to have limited the class of cases in which it might be taken. The plaintiff is never required to file an affidavit of merits, for an inquest cannot be taken against him. (Began v. Priest, 3 Denio, 163.) When to be flade.]-The affidavit may not be made be- fore the complaint has been served or filed, or at least read by the defendant (Geib v. Icard, 11 Johns. 82; see Phillips v. Prescoit, sp. t., 9 How. 433); for it is impossible that the defendant should know that he has a good defense, unless he knows the nature of the claim made against him. It may be made at any subsequent time prior to the time at which it is to be filed and served, as to which, see |ifra.,The affidavit must be made for this purpose only, and an affidavit of merits made for any other purpose <as for uxample, upon a motion to change the place of trial) will not suffice to prevent an inquest (Cutler v. Biggs, 2 Hill,,1
Affidavit of merits. When to be made. By whom to be made. 409; see Colegate v. Marsh, sp. t., 2 How. 137; Alberti v. Peck, sp. t., 1 How. 230; Popham v. Baker, sp. t., 1 How. 166; Robinson v. Sinclair, sp. t., 1 How. 106); but the affidavit, being once made for this purpose, and duly fled and served, is sufficient for the whole time in which the cause may be pending, though it may be on the calendar for several terms (Prescott v. Roberts, 6 Cow. 46; see Yan Rensselaer v. Hamilton, 4 Cow. 539, 540), and even though the place of trial is subsequently changed to another county. (Prescott v. Roberts, supra.),By whom to be made.]-The affidavit must be made by the defendant himself (Roosevelt v. Dale, 2 Cow. 581; John- son v. jLnch, sp. t., 15 How. 199; Mason v. Bidleman, sp. t., 1 How. 61), unless some sufficient excuse is given for his not doing so (ib.), such as absence fiom the county, sickness, &c. Where such excuses are offered, they must be fully set forth in the affidavit (see Rooseveltv. Dale, 2 Cow. 581), and it must be shown that the defend- ant's disability continued down to the opening of the court (see Johnson v. Lynch, sp. t., 15 How. 199), for if it did not, he ought to make the affidavit.,Where there are several defendants, they must all swear to merits, or an inquest may be taken against those who do not, if it is a case in which separate trials maybe had (Clark v. Parker, 19 Wend. 125), unless they have a common ground of defense, in which case one of them may make the affidavit, stating that fact, and it will suffice for all. (Ib.),Upon a valid excuse being given, the defendant's attorney or counsel (see Phillips v. Blagge, 3 Johns. 141; Scott v. Gibbs, 2 Johns. Cas. 116), or any person whose interest makes him the substantial defendant, though not such on the record (Miller v. Hooker, sp. t., 2 How. 124), or probably any real agent of the defendant, acquainted with the facts, may make the affidavit. 444
Affidavit of merits. What it must contain.,--~- -- _me affidavit.]-The affidavit must allege that the de- fendant has, unless he is himself a counselor of the court (Cromwell v. Van Rensselaer, 3 Cow. 346), in which case the clause as to the statement of the case to counsel, and lis advice thereon, may be omitted (ib.), fully (ante, i. 183, Iule 21; Cary v. Livernore, sp. t., 2 How. 170; Brown v. Tousey, 19 Wend. 617), and fairly (ib.; Bleecker v. Storms, Ã³p. t., 2 How. 161), stated the case (Fitzheugh v. Truax, 1 Hill, 644; Ellis v. Jones, sp. t., 6 How. 296; Tomnl)kins v. Acer, sp. t., 10 How. 309;. Rickards v-. Swet- zer, sp. t., 3 How. 414; Richnmold v. Cowles, 2 Hill, 359; Brownell v. Marsh, 22 Wend. 636), to his counsel, giving the name and residence of such counsel (ante, i. 183, Rule 21), and that he is advised by such counsel (M'Murray v. Gifford, sp. t., 5 How. 14; Swartcout v. lIoage, 16 Johns. 3; Canlnonl v. Titus, 5 Johns. 355; Bruen v. Adams, 3 Caines, 97), and believes (Lynch7 v. Mosher, sp. t., 4 How. 86; Wharton v. Barry, sp. t., 1 How. 60; Brittan v. Peabody, 4 Hill, 61), that he has a good (Bk. of Utica v. Boot, 4 Hill, 535), and substantial defense on the merits (Tomlpkins v. Acer, sp. t., 10 How. 309; Meech v. Calkins, 4 Hill, 534; Priangle v. Marsack, 1 Dowl. & Ryl. 155; Bower v. Kemp, 1 Cr. & Jer. 287), in (or to) the action. (Tate v. Bodfield, 3 Dowl. P. C. 218; see Mason v. Moore, sp. t., 2 How. 70; Howe v. Hasbrouclk, sp. t., 1 id. 67; Durant v. C pJk, sp. t., id. 45.) For the form of an affidavit of merits, see ante, i. 403, 34. That form should be strictly followed, as the least deviation therefrom may be fatal, and in no case can it be advantageous. For examples of the danger of such deviations in apparently trivial points, see ante, i. 535. Even the addition of any matter is dangerous, if it changes the sense in the least degree. Thus whore, after swearing to a defense "in this cause," the defendant added " to the note on which the action was brought",445
(Durant v. Cook, sp. t., 1 How. 43), or " to the complaint therein" (Howe v. Hasbrouck, sp. t., 1 How. 67), the affl. davit was held ineffective to prevent an inquest. But it may be questioned whether these decisions are not super. seded by Supreme Court rule 92 of 1847.,Nothing more can be required than is above stated Thus it is not necessary to state expressly that the advice of counsel was given after the case had been stated to him (Brown v. Seys, sp. t., 2 How. 276), although it is of course necessary that such should be the fact.,Filing and service.]--The affidavit must be filed, and a copy thereof served upon the plaintiff's attorney. (Rule 29, Supreme Ct.; Baker v. Ashley, 15 Johns. 536; Cannon v. Titus, 5 id. 355); with a notice of the original being on file. (See Cannon v. Titus, supra..),This may be done, with full effect, at any time before an inquest is actually entered upon (see Anon., sp. t., 6 Abl). 512; Brainard v. Hanford, 6 Hill, 368), though, if it is left until the very day upon which an inquest is taken, notice of the service must be actually brought home to the plaintiff's attorney or counsel (Brainard v. Hanford, 6 Hill, 368), and for this purpose, the service may be made upon the counsel having charge of the cause at the circuit, though not the attorney of record. (Ib.) If, how- ever; the plaintiff's attorney has good reason to expect that an affidavit of merits will be served, and endeavors to anticipate such service by an. inquest, he will be held to strict practice, and service at his office, without his actual knowledge, at any time before the inquest, makes the latter irregular. (Anon., sp. t., 6 Abb. 512.),Service on the second day of the circuit, upon a clerk of the plaintiff's attorney, was held sufficient to prevent an inquest, it appearing that the clerk might, with due diligence, have notified his employer thereof before the inquest was taken. (Smith v. Aylesworth, 24 How. 35.) 446,TRUAI BY JURBY.
Disputing the afidalit.]-In general, the plaintiff is not allowed to dispute the truth of the affidavit, in order to sustain his right to an inquest (Hanford v. M'l'air, 2 Wend. 286; Phillips v. Blagge, 3 Johns. 141), but if it is made by some one else than the defendant he may show that the excuse assigned for its being so made was untrue. (Johnson v. Lynch, sp. t., 15 How. 199.),ART. 6.-Calling and reserving causes. Calling the calendar.]-On the opening of the circuit, after some preliminary matters have been attended to, which do not require notice here, the judge proceeds to call off the calendar. In some districts, it is usual to call the whole calendar on the first day, in order to ascer- tain what causes are or will be ready for trial during the term. In other districts, a day calendar is made up at the beginning, and in all, such a calendar is prepared for every day after the first of the term. This day calendar consists of a limited number of causes, taken in their order from the general calendar, subject to such change in the strict numerical order as may be made by statutory preferences, or by the reservation of causes for trial on particular days. Both parties must appear and answer when the cause is called, otherwise the default of the absent party may be taken by the other, or, if all parties to the cause are absent, it will be passed, and go to the foot of the calendar. The cause cannot, however, be called, except by consent, before the time for which it was noticed, according to the true time of the place where the court sits. (Curtis v. March, 3 Hurlst. & N. 866.) leserving causes.]-In the city of New York, any cause may be reserved generally by the consent of all parties, or their attorneys, in writing, filed with the clerk of the court at any time before the cause is placed on the day calendar. Causes so reserved may be placed upon the,TBUUL BY iny.,447
448,-- Reserving causes. Inquest. In what cases allowed.,_ - I-- ---- day calendar on two days' notice, on the application of either party to a judge of the court at chamnbes, upon two days' notice of such application to the adverse party. This is prescribed by express rule in the Superior Court, and by the Common Pleas (ante, i. 234), and it is also the practice of the Supreme Court in the first district.,It is usual to allow causes to be thus reserved by oral consent in open court at the commencemer' of the term, for which purpose the attorney on one side only is often left in charge of the case; but this is entirely in the discretion of the judge.,AnT. 7.-Inquest. The Code did not abrogate the practice of taking inquests. (Anderson v. Houghl, 1 Sands. 721; 1 Code Rep. 50; and see ante, p. 443.),Inlquest, wihat.]-An inquest is a proceeding by which a cause is taken up out of its regular order by the plaintiff, and a trial had, in which no affirmative defense is admitted.,In what cases allowed.]-Inquests may be taken in the cases authorized by the practice before the Code, provided an intention so to do is expressed in the notice of trial, and no sufficient affidavit of merits is filed and served. (Rule 29, Supreme Ct.) This practice was always confined to the common law courts, and as it is not extended to new cases by the rule, it is applicable now only to actions for ordinary relief.,In the New York Superior Court, causes will be taken up at the opening of the court on the day on which they are placed on the day calendar, and inquests taken therein, on application of the plaintiff, notwithstanding an affidavit of merits has been filed, unless the defendant in such an action appears and states that a defense will be made. (Ante, i. 228; Bule 17, Superior Ct.)
IqUwst. Against whom. Notioe. When to be taken. Who tmay take.]-Only the plaintiff can take an inquest, even though the action has assumed such a shape that the defendant has the affirmative of the issue, and the most interest in the prosecution of the suit. (See Regan v. Priest, 3 Denio, 163.),Against whom.]-An inquest cannot be taken against a part of the defendants, without serving all, as to whom issue is joined, with notice of trial and inquest (Living- ston v. McIntyre, sp. t., 2 How. 41); but when all are served, an inquest may be taken against a portion of them, if the action is severable (Clark v. Parker, 19 Wend. 125), as in the case of separate parties to a bill or note, sued together. (Ib.) And where some of the defendants fail to answer, an inquest may be taken against the rest. (Bank of Rochester v. Boulton, 5 Wend, 106.*) Notice.]-The plaintiff cannot take an inquest unless he gave notice of his intention to do so (Rule 29) to all the defendants who have joined issue with him (Livingston v. Mclntyre, sp. t., 2 How. 41); and this notwithstanding he has received a notice of trial from the defendant. (Potter v. Davison, sp. t., 8 Abb. 43.) As to the requisites of the notice, see ante, p. 433. When to be taken.]-An inquest may be taken on any day after the first day of the term, at the opening of the court (Rule 29, Supreme Ct.); but cannot be taken (or if taken, is irregular) on the first day (Smith v. Brown, 1 Duer, 665), nor on any day after the court has taken up other business (Anon., sp. t., 6 Abb. 512; Newconzb v. Johnson, 9 Wend. 451), nor after the jury are discharged for the day. (Haines v. Davis, 6 How. 118, 120; Dicken- lon v. KimbaU, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 83.) * The distinction made in Cuddeback v. Sandy (2 Wend. 624), and recog- ized in the principal case, is obsolete under the Code.,57,449
Inquest. Defendant's rights. Defal Defendant's rights.]-The defendant may appear on the inquest, and has a right to cross-examine witnesses, object to evidence, and except to rulings of the court (Gree v. Willis, 1 Wend. 78), but cannot introduce testimony on his part (see ib.), nor, even by cross-examination, prove an affirmative defense. (Kerker v. Carter, 1 Hill, 101; Hartness v. Boyd, 5 Wend. 563.),If the cause is called in its order on the calendar, the proceeding is necessarily a trial, and not an inquest, and the defendant has all the rights which he would have if he had made an affidavit of merits (Starkwveatker v. Cars. well, 1 Wend. 77.),Mode ofproceeding.]-Subject to the limitations before stated, the course of proceeding on an inquest is precisely the same as upon an ordinary trial.,ART. 8.-Default. WhIo can take.]-No one can take a default against the adverse party, who has not served a notice of trial (Code, ' 258), and filed a note of issue. (Browning v. Paige, sp. t., 7 How. 487.),Plaintiff's dlefault.]-If the plaintiff fails to appear on the trial, the defendant may move to dismiss the com- plaint, or for such judgment as the case may require. (Code, Â§ 258.) And one of several defendants, having a separate defense, and having appeared separately, may take the plaintiff's default, notwithstanding the other defendants do not appear. (Gurnee v. Hoxie, 29 Barb. 547.),If the answer controverts the allegations of the com- plaint, the defendant is entitled to a judgment of dismissal, upon the proof of service of the notice of trial. But if the defendant relies upon a counterclaim for his defense, he must prove his case, in like manner with a plainti, upon the default of a defendant, and all the remarks unde that head apply to the case of such a defendant. 450
Default. Form of proceeding. Postponement. Defendant's default.]-If the defendant fails to appear, the plaintiff may proceed with his case (Code, Â§ 258, which however he must prove by competent evidence unless the defendant's answer contains no valid defense, or con- sists entirely of new matter, in which case the burden of proof is on the defendant, and therefore the plaintiff can- not be required to disprove it. By his default, the defendant waives his right to a jury (Code, Â§ 266), and as a general rule, no jury should be impanneled in the cause, after a default. (Goodyear v. Baird, 11 How. 377.) If the judge undertakes the trial without a jury, he must assess the plaintiff's damages, if any; for he cannot send the cause to a sheriff's jury for that purpose (Giber- ton v. Pleischel, 5 Duer, 652), though he may order a reference to take an account, if necessary. (Code, 5 271.) Fort of proceeding.]-If a jury is impanneled, the pro- ceedings are similar to those upon ordinary trials by jury, except that they are carried on by one party only. If there is no jury, the proceedings are, to the same extent, similar to those upon an ordinary trial of a question of fact by the court, and the decision must be rendered in like manner. Opening default.]-For the mode of application to open a default, see post, chapter xevii,ALT. 9.-Postponement. If either party is not ready to proceed when the cause is ealled, he should apply to the judge for a postponement to a subsequent day or term. Cases for postponement.]-The trial ought to be put off, in ease of the absence from the state (People v. Termilyea, 7 lowr. 383; Ogden v. Payne, 5 id. 15; Vermilyea v. Rogers, 4:Ril, 567; Brown v. Murray, -4 Dowl. & Ryl. 830), or iheas (Hoolar v. Rogers, 6 Cow, 577; see Fermihea v.,451 TBIAL BY JUBY.
Postponement. For absence of withesse Rogers, 4 Hill, 570) or absence from the court, after being duly subpoenaed (Hooker v. Rogers, 6 Cow. 577), of a material (Brill v. Lord, 14 Johns. 341; Rex v. D'Eo, I W. Blacks. 510; 3 Burr. 1513; see People v. Vermilyea, 7 Cow. 383) witness; even if he is the attorney for the applicant (Ogden v. Payne, 5 Cow. 15), and a fortiori, if he is an adverse party. (Vermilyea v. Rogers, 4 Hill, 567; see Bosworth v. Perhamis, 20 Wend. 611.) So the trial should be put off when time is required to procure doe- mentary evidence from a distant place. (Mackenzie v. Hudson, 1 Dowl. & Ryl. 159.),But if the witness is not likely to return to the state (Rex v. D'Eon, 3 Burr. 1513; 1 W. Blacks, 510; see Pm. pie v. Yerrnilyea, 7 Cow. 383), or if there has been full opportunity to subpoena him, and it has not been done (Bourne v. Church, Barnes, 442; see Saunders v. Pittman, 1 Bos. & Pul. 33), or if he is not a resident of the state,* and the applicant for a postponement has had an oppor- tunity to take his testimony do bete esse (McKaig v. Marine Ins. Co, 2 Caines, 384; see Hays v. Berrymw, sp. t., 6 Bosw. 679), or if the applicant has unfairly delayed the cause, so that it is his own fault that the trial comes on during the absence of the witness (Sunders v. Pittman, 1 Bos. & Pul. 33), or if the adverse party will admit the facts which it is expected the witness will prove (Brilv. Lord, 14 Johns. 341), and not merely that the witnes will swear to those facts (People v. Yermnilyea, 7 Cow. 369, 387; see Bank of Commeree v. Michel, 1 Sands. 687), or if the applicant's defense is an odious one (Robinson v. Smyth, 1 Bos. & Pul. 454), no postponement will be granted.,The neglect of a witness to attend, after being duly * Otherwise, where the adverse party is the witness on account of whm absence the postponement is sought, provided he has been requeste to attend.

postponement. The motion. Affidavit. subpcenaed, seems to us cause for a postponement only until the return of an attachment against him. probably a very substantial excuse for the absence of the party himself must be shown, when it is sought on his behalf to delay the trial on that account. His arrest, while on the way to the trial, is a sufficient reason for postponement, even when he is not a material witness, though not without payment of costs. (Solomon v. Under- hill, 1 Campb. 222). The unavoidable absence of all the counsel for a party is good ground for a postponement (Hayley v. Grant, Sayer, 63; see Koy v. Clough, 2 Caines, 381), but the absence of a part of the counsel engaged is not (M'lay v. Jarine Ins. Co., 2 Caines, 384; Post v. Wright, 1 id. 111), even though the absentee is the principal counsel. (l'Kay v. Marine Ins. Co., supra.) And the absence of counsel must, in general, to justify a postponement to another term, be caused by sickness or some equally im- perative necessity, and n, merely by engagements in another court (see Jacl;son v. Wakeman, 2 Cow. 578), though such engagements are usually received as an ex- cuse for a few days' delay. (See Fake v. Edgerton, sp. t., 6 Duer, 653.) The fact that the cause has been once before tried by the same judge, is no reason whatever for postponing it. (Fry v. Bennett, 3 Bosw. 200, 231; Willis v. Farrer, 3 You. & Jer. 381.) The nwtion.]-The application for a postponement may be made to the judge at the circuit (Darke v. Dick, 1 Price P. . 38), and without notice to the adverse party. (1 B~rr. Pr. 423.) Affdavit.]-As a general rule, the affidavit on which. the motion is made must be sworn to by one of the par- ties asking the postponement (Carter v. Uppington, Barnes, 437), but if none of them are within reach, it may be,453 TBIAL BY JURY.
made by their attorney (Duberley v. Gunning, Peake i. p. 97), or by the managing clerk of the attorney, upon his stating in the affidavit that he has the management of the cause and is particularly acquainted with its circum- stances (see Sullivan v. Magill, 1 H. Blacks. 637), but not otherwise. (Sullivan v. Magill, supra; Chase v. Edward, 2 Wend. 283.),When the application is made on account of the absence of a witness, the affidavit must always distinctly show: (1.) That the witness is really material; (2.) That the applicant has been guilty of no neglect in securing his attendance; and (3.) That the witness can probablybe had at the time to which the trial is deferred. (Rez v. D'Eon, 1 W. Blacks. 510; 3 Burr. 1513; approved, People v. Vermilyea, 7 Cow. 384; see Onderdonk v. RarJett, . Hill, 328.),On the first application of this kind, the affidavt need not state anything more than this (People v. Vermnly, 7 Cow. 385; Hooker v. Bogers, 6 Cow. 577; Ogden v. Payne, 5 Cow. 15; Pulver v. Hiserodt, sp. t., 3 How. 49), unless circumstances appear which cast suspicion upon the good faith of the application (ib.; see Onderdonk v. Ranlett, 3 Hill, 328), in which case the applicant may be required to disclose the nature of the testimony, and its bearing upon the case. (See ib.) It seems to be the practice in this state to require the absent witness to be named, as it will be found was done in all the reported cases, though it has been held in England not to be necessary on the first application. (Smith v. Dobson, 2 Dowl. & 3ryl. 420; Buckingham v. Banks, 4 id. 832 n.),On a second or subsequent motion for postponement, the facts must be very fully stated, and the necessity of the postponement more clearly shown. (Anon., 1 Chittg Rep. 686 a.) But a previous postponement which did not really prevent the cause from being tried, no issue sb young being tried at that circuit, is not to be taken into 454,TRULLI BY ~UY.
postponement. Affidavit on motion. Opposing motion. account at all under this rule. (Pulver v. Hiserodt, sp. t., 3 How. 49.) The advice of counsel as to the materiality of the wit- ness should, we think, be stated in like manner as upon a motion to change the place of trial, though we find no decision to that effect. It is not necessary to swear again to merits. (Att'y Gen. v. Hull, 2 Dowl. P. 0. 111; Cookson v. Simpson, 1 Chitt. Rep. 686 n.),Â§ 281. Affidavit on motion to put off trial.

Bdgerto, sp. t., 6 Duer, 653), or by showing that their statements are untrue, or by raising a suspicion as to the good faith of the -application, or showing in any other way that the case is not a proper one for granting a post-,455
ponement. But the court will not, in general, discuss the completenlcy of the evidence which is made the basis of the motion (Mackenzie v. Hiudson, 1 Dowl. & Ryl. 159), provided it is material if competent.,7The decision.]-It rests very much in the discretion of the judge to grant or refuse the application, and his de- cision will rarely be interfered with, at any rate where he grants the motion (Yermilyea v. Rogers, 4Hill, 567); though if the motion is denied without sufficient reason, and the applicant is prejudiced thereby, a new trial will be granted. (People v. Vermilyea, 7 Cow. 369; Hooker v. Rogers, 6 Cow. 577; Ogden v. Payne, 5 Cow. 15.) Such an error cannot be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment, for it cannot be made the subject of an exception. (Rapelye v. Prince, 4 Hill, 119.),Imposition of terms.]-When the motion is granted, it is usual to impose, as a condition, the payment of costs (1 Burr. Pr. 423; Grak. Pr. 287), which cannot, however, exceed ten dollars, and the fees of witnesses in addition (Code, Â§ 314.),Other terms may, however, be imposed. Thus, where the defendant was in failing health, he was required to stipulate that the action should not abate in case of his death, and this stipulation was enforced (Ames v. Web- bers, 10 Wend. 575; see Grifith v. Williams, 1 Cromp. & Jer. 47), and a defendant in a libel suit was required to admit the publication of the libel (Brown v. Murray, 4 Dowl. & Ryl. 830), and in an action of debt, the payment of the sum claimed into court has been required. (1 Burr. Pr. 423; 2 Archb. Pr. 237.) But terms of this nature should be imposed in none but extreme cases. (See Ha1 v. Dwinell, 10 Wend. 628.),Payment of costs.]-If the order does not fix any time for the payment of the costs, the party moving for it has 456,TBUL B'it JMBH.

Incidents of trial. twenty days within which to pay them, if the amount is adjusted by the order (Rule 57, Supreme Ct.), or if not, he has fifteen days after the adjustment by the proper officer. (Id.) But it is his duty to seek out the adverse party, and offer the costs, without waiting for a demand. (Jack- bM v. Pel, 19 Johns. 270.) The order.]-An order should be drawn up, in case the motion is granted, stating the time to which, and the terms on which, the trial is postponed. It should be made conditional on compliance with the terms prescribed (see Bagley v. Ostrom, 5 Hill, 516), and may very properly direct that in case of non-compliance therewith, by a certain time, the trial shall proceed, or even that judgment absolute shall be rendered against the party in default. (Booth v. Thitby, 4 Hill, 446.),Â§ 282. Order postponing trial. [tkle of cause.] On the annexed affidavit, let the trial of this action be put off until ............., on payment to the ............ 's attorney of ....... dollars costs [this day.],[Judge's signature.] ART. 10.-Incidents of the trial. Papers for the court.--It is the duty of the plaintiff to furnish the court with a copy of the summons and plead- ings, and of any offer made by the defendant (Code, Â§ 259), and no doubt if he should refuse to do so, the court might refuse to try the cause. But if the defendant brings on the trial, he may furnish the necessary papers. (Id.) Stenographer.]-In the city of New York a stenographer reports the proceedings in each court. (Code, Â§ 256.) Demurrer to evidence.]-This proceeding is practically obsolete. It is a matter of discretion with the judge to,58,457
allow it to be taken or not (Colegrove v. N. . & N. X. R. R. Co., 20 N. Y. 492), and it has not been allowed for many years. The practice upon such demurrers is stated in i Burrill's Practice, 240; Graham's Pr. (2d ed.) 308.,JReference.]-Frequently, upon its becoming apparent that the trial will involve the examination of long ac- counts, or that for other reasons the cause should be referred, the trial is suspended and a reference ordered. This is sometimes done upon motion, but often also with. out any application by the voluntary action of the judge. No notice of the motion (if one is made) is necessary when both parties are present (see M'Coun v. Romvlei, 19 Wend. 85), nor when one of the parties fails to appear on the cause being regularly called; but notice must be given of a motion to refer made at any other time. (M'Coun v. Rowley, 19 Wend. 85.),Jurisdiction of the court.]-The judge at circuit retains jurisdiction of the causes on the calendar, even after they have been called and passed.,Thus, where on a cause being called, the plaintiff offered to discontinue and pay costs, and thereupon the cause was passed; the defendant, ten days afterwards, upon showing that the costs had not been paid, obtained an order from the judge dismissing the complaint with costs and an allowance. On appeal, the order was held valid and right. (Moffat v. Ford, 14 Barb. 577.),Admissions.]-Admissions in a pleading cannot be con- tradicted by evidence on behalf of the pleader. (Crosbi v. Leary, 6 Bosw. 312.) And after a cause has been sub- mitted upon certain admissions, they cannot be retracted' gvithout leave of the court, and a re-opening of the case so as to give the adverse party full opportunity to prove the facts. (Kohler v. Wright, 7 Bosw. 318.),I:i: 458,TRIAL BY JURY.
Judgnmet on tho pleadings. The jury.,ART. 11.--Jdgment on the pleadings. Either party may, at the opening of the trial, move for such judgment upon the pleadings as he may be entitled to. (Budd v. Binghatn, 18 Barb. 494; Burmham v. De Bevoise, sp. t., 8 How. 159.) In the New York Superior Court, as we have seen (ante, p. 434), this motion may be made on the first day of the trial term, upon giving due notice for that purpose. On such a motion, the truth of the adverse party's pleading is admitted for the purpose of the motion. The only questions raised are such as are involved upon a demurrer for want of jurisdiction, or for want of facts oonstituting a cause of action or a defense. Such admission is not, however, deemed binding upon the moving party, if his motion is denied, but he is al- lowed to go to trial upon the issues formed by the plead- ings.,ART. 12.-TlwejUry. Qualifications ofjurors.]--None are qualified to serve as jurors, who are not,1. Citizens of the United States (Borst v. Beecker, 6 Johns. 332; see Co. Litt. 156); 2. Male inhabitants of the county; 3. Over 21, and under 60 years old; 4. Owners of real property worth $150, or of personal property worth $250, for which (except in the city of New York) they are assessed; 5. In the possession of all their natural faculties, and not infirm or decrepit; 6. Free from all legal exceptions, of fair character, of approved integrity, of sound judgment, and well informed. (3.. S. (5th7 ed.) 695; [2 id. 411].),_ .* ;*The statute recognizes ownership in a wife's right as a qualification. Bat this species of ownership is nearly extinct,459
The fact that a person offered as a juror ought to be assessed, is not sufficdent to qualify him, if he is not actu. ally assessed, and owns no real property. (Valton y. National Loan &c., Ins. So., 17 Abb. 268.),In the counties of Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Catta. raugus, Allegany, Genesee, Orleans, Monroe, Livingston, Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence, Steuben and Franklin, any person who is assessed for land in his possession under a contract to purchase the same, upon which im. povements to the value of $150 have been made, which he owns, is deemed to own $150 of real estate, within the meaning of the foregoing rule. (Ib.),Certain exemptions are allowed by statute, but as such exemptions are the privilege of the jurors personally, and form no ground of challenge, we omit them here. They will be found stated in 3 R. ,S. (5th ed.) 695-716; [2 id 411].,Summoning jurors.]-The mode of summoning jurors is prescribed by various statutes, so fully that no judicial decisions appear to have been since made upon the sub- ject; and we therefore refer to these statutes, as embodied in 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 695-716; [2 id. 411].,Alien juries.]-No one is now entitled to claim a jury of part aliens or strangers. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 718; [2 id. 419].),Calling and swearing the jury.]-At the opening of the court, the clerk must prepare ballots, each bearing the name and address of a juror summoned by the proper officer, folded so as to conceal the names, and deposit them in a box. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 718; [2 id. 420].) When any issue is brought on for trial, the clerk must draw out of the box, without looking at them, a number of ballots, one after another, sufficient to form a jury (ib.), which is to consist of the twelve whose names are first called and 460.,TRIALL BY AMY.
approved as indifferent jurors. (Id. 719; [420].) The ballots thus drawn are to be placed in a separate box until the jury is discharged, after which they are to be replaced in the general box. (Ib.) When a juror is called, but does not answer, or is set aside, the ballot bearing his name must be folded up, and, as soon as the jury is sworn, replaced in the general jury box. (3 R. S. (sth ed.) 720; [2 id. 421].) These provisions are, however, merely directory, and though the clerk will be required to conform to them, yet an unintentional deviation therefrom cannot be made the ground of a motion for a new trial, unless a party has been actually prejudiced thereby. (People v. Ransom, 7 Wend. 417; Cole v. Perry, 6 Cow. 584.) As each successive juror is called, he takes his seat in the jury box, unless challenged; and when the jury is fully made up, all the jurors are sworn in the usual form, " well and truly to try the issue between A. B. and C. D., and a true verdict to give according to the evidence.",Talesmen.J-If the panel of jurors is exhausted, the court may direct the sheriff, or, if he is a party to the action, any other person, to summon jurors from the by- standers or others, from whom, after they are duly returned and sworn, a jury may be selected. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 719; [2 id. 421].) And a jury may be either partly or wholly composed of persons thus summoned (ib.), who are called talesmen. Special jury.]-The Revised Statutes (3 IB. S. (5th ed.) 716; [2 id. 418]), authorize the court to summon a special or struck jury, on motion, when it appears that a fair trial cannot be had without such a jury, or when the impor- tance or intricacy of the cause demands it. But such juries are practically obsolete in this state, as the courts do not esteem them to be conducive to the prompt and fair administration of justice. We are not aware of any,461 TRIALI BY JURLY.
The jury. Special jury. Foreign jury. Challenge to array. reported case in the last fifty years, in which such ajury has been ordered, while the latest decisions) Walsh v. Sum Mut. Ins. Co., sp. t., 17 Abb. 356; Nesmitl v. Atlanti Ins. Co. sp. t., 8 Abb. 423; Patchin v. Sands, 10 Wend. 570), seem to settle the practice of the courts against them. ,,We therefore omit all account of them here, referring those who may desire information upon a subject appa. rently so unprofitable, to the statute already cited, and to 1 Burrill's Practice, 440.,Foreign ji'ry.]-The court would formerly, in very rare and peculiar cases, order a jury to be drawn from a county other than that in which the trial was had. (See Stryl;er v. Tulrnbull, 3 Caines, 103.) This proceeding s, however, even more obsolete than struck juries. The last reported application for a foreign jury (Patchin v. Sands, 10 Wend. 570) was denied, in terms which leave no room to suppose that any circumstances could eist which would induce the court to grant it. The provi- sion made by the Code of Procedure for changing the place of trial for the purpose of securing an impartial trial (ante, i. 530), appears to remove all possible reason for retaining this proceeding, inasmuch as all the relief which it contemplates may be had by means of an appli- cation under the Code. We therefore omit all account of the proceedings upon an application for a foreign jury, referring the reader to Burrill's Practice, vol. i. 442, for information on the subject.,ART. 13.-ChÂ¢allenges to the jury. On the appearance of a full jury, but not before (see Rex v. Edmonds, 4 Barn. & Aid. 471; Brunskill v. Giles, 9 Bing. 13), either party may challenge them, or any of them, for cause.,Challenges are either to the array, or to the polls. Challenge to the array.]-An objection may be made to all the jurors collectively, on account of some partiality 462
.Cl.Uelnges. To the array. To the polla. or default in the officer who summoned the jurors, or diew their names. This is called a challenge to the array. (1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 305; 1 Burr. Pr. 453; 3 Blacks. ~o.i 359.) This species of challenge is so much restric- ted by statute (3 B. 8. (5th ed.) 718; [2 id. 420]), as to have gone entirely out of use in civil actions. No grounds of such challenge appear to be now sufficient, unless they involve positive misconduct on the part of one of the officers concerned in arraying the jury. (See 1 Burr. Pr. 454; 1 Monell Pr. 660.) A challenge to the array cannot be made after the jury has been impanneled and sworn. (Mayor &c. of N. Y. v. Mason, 4 E. D. Smith, 142, 152.),ihallenge to the polls.]-Each juror may be objected to, on grounds personal to him. Such objections are called challenges to the polls. These challenges consist of three classes: 1. Challen- ges for principal cause; 2. Challenges for favor; 3. Per- emptory challenges. A challenge for principal cause is one in which the reason assigned is so strong that, if the facts alleged are true, it necessarily follows that the juror is not fit to try the issue. (1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 308;. 1 Burr. Pr. 454; see Freeman v. People, 4 Denio, 36.) A challenge for favor is one in which the facts alleged establish only a probability that the juror may not be impartial in his judgment (ib.), and upon consideration of which the triers are at liberty to reject or admit the juror, according as they deem him impartial or not. (People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 308.) (Challenge for disqualifiation.]-If any of the jury are not possessed of the qualifications prescribed by law (see ante, p. 459), they may be challenged for principal cause on that grouund (1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 306; 1 Burr. Pr. 454); but not on account of any exemption accorded to them by law (ib.; Rex v. Edmonds, 4 Barn. & Aid. 471), for that is the personal privilege of the juror.,463
Challenges. Challenge for orime. Challenge for bla, Clallenge for criine.]-A conviction for an infamous crime is conclusive evidence of bad character, and, of course, disqualifies a juror, unless he has been pardoned. A challenge for this cause is substantially a challenge for disqualification, though it is usually treated of as a sepa. rate species. (See 3 Blacks. Corn. 363; 1 Burr. Pr. 454; 1 Arclib. Pr. 7th ed. 308.) It is, of course, a challenge for principal cause.,ClIllengefor bias.]-A bias or partiality in the mind of a juror, in favor of either party, is a good cause of chal- lenge, either for principal cause or for favor, according to the circumstances.,Consanguinity to the ninth degree, affinity (1 Burr. Pr. 454), interest in the event of the suit (ib.; Wood v. Sod. dard, 2 Johns. 194; Heskethl v. Braddock, 3 Burr. 1847), or in a controversy which depends upon the same principles or evidence (1 Burr. Pr. 454), are grounds of principal challenge.,So, if a juror is in the employment of either party (Co. Litt. 157); or is his tenant (Hathaway v. Helmer, 25 Barb. 29; Gilb. C. B. 95); or has a lawsuit pending be tween himself and either party, of such a nature as to imply ill feeling, as for defamation, assault, &c. (see Peo- ple v. Bodise, 1 Denio, 305); or has expressed a positive, and not merely a hypothetical (F;reeman v. People, 4 Denio, 9; Durell v. Mosher, 8 Johns. 445; see People v. Sachez, 18 How. 72; 4 Park. Cr. 535; but see Rogers v. Rogers, 14 Wend. 131) opinion on the merits of the controversy (Cawcemi v. People, 16 N. Y. 501; 7 Abb. 271; Peoplev. Matlwr, 4 Wend. 231; Ex parte Fermilyea, 6 Cow. 54, and Ms. case cited; Blakne v. Milspaugh, 1 Johns. 316); or even if he has formed a decided opinion, though not ex- pressed (see People v. Rathbiu, 21 Wend. 542); but not where the juror has simply received a mere impression from what he has heard, not sufficient to affect his judg- ment upon the evidence. (People v. Sanchez, 18 How. 72; 464
Challenges. Challenge for bias. How made, 4 Park. Cr. 535; see Rex v. Edmonds, 4 Barn. & Aid. 490.) The mere testimony of the juror that he could render an impartial verdict, notwithstanding the opinion he had formed, is, however, not enough to make him competent (Canlwmii v. Peo2le, 16 N. Y. 501; 7 Abb. 271; People v. Mather, 4 Wend. 244), and this, although he denies that hehad formed afixed opinion. (Cancemi v. People, supra.) A challenge for favor, but not for principal cause, will lie where any circumstances exist which may possibly, but do not necessarily, prejudice the juror. Thus, the challenge can only be for favor, where the objection is that the juror is indebted to one of the parties (see Mechanics &c. Bank v. Smith, 19 Johns. 115; People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 306); or that he is his fellow-servant (Co. Litt. 157; see People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 305); or a mem- ber of the same club or society, even though they are both freemasons (Putrple v. Horton, 13 Wend. 9, 22, over- ruling 3 Blacks. Corn. 363); or is on terms of intimacy with him (Anon., 3 Salk. 81); or that he is, by the nature of his business, likely to be often involved in controversies of the same nature (see Steinbach7 v. Columbitla Ins. Co., 2 Caines, 133); or that he has a dispute of any kind with one of the parties (see Co. Litt. 157); or that he has expressed or formed a hypothetical opinion on the case. (People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 308; Freeman v. People, 4 id. 9; People v. Stout, 4 Park. Cr. 71, 109, 132.) How made.]-A challenge to the array must be made in writing (1 Cow. 439, note; and see forms there given); but a challenge to the polls may be made orally. (1 C'ow. 441, note; 1 Burr. Pr. 454.) The ground of challenge must be stated (Freeman v. People, 4 Denio, 9, 31; Mann v. Glover, 2 Green, 195*), *To the contrary, see 1 Burr. Pr. 454; Trialsper pais, 143.,59,465
and it is not enough to say that it is "for principal cause" or "for favor." (Ib.),How tried. ]-The mode of trial upon a challenge to the array lies in the discretion of the court. (1 Cow. 441, note.),Challenges to the polls for principal cause must always be tried by the court (Pringle v. Huse, 1 Cow. 432; pe Canceeni v. People, 16 N. Y. 501; 7 Abb. 421), and its decision thereon is reviewable upon exceptions. (Cancemi v. People, supra; People v. Rathibun, 21 Wend. 546; see People v. ernmilyea, 7 Cow. 108; 6 id. 555.),Challenges for favor must be tried by triers (see Peopl v. Mather, 4 Wend. 239), who consist of the first twojurors allowed as impartial (1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 309; 1 Burr. Pr. 455; 1 Cow. 441, note), and until two jurors are allowed, two impartial persons and no more (M'Cormick v. Brook- field, 1 Southard, 69), must be appointed by the court for the purpose (1 Burr. Pr. 455; 1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 309), who must be sworn well and truly to try whether the juror challenged is indifferent between the parties to the issue. (Anon., 1 Salk. 152.),As soon as one juror is admitted, he joins the two triers in trying the next (Co. Litt. 158; 1 Blacks. Corn. 363), and as soon as two jurors are accepted, they supersede the triers altogether, and assume their functions. (1 Black Com. 363; see Anon., 1 S.alk. 152.),The parties may, however, by consent, authorize the court to act as sole trier of the issue (People v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 509, 542; Stout v. People, sp. t., 4 Park. Cr. 132; People v. Mather, 4 Wend. 240), and by giving evidence thereon before asking for the appointment of triers, they are deemed to waive tleir right to have triers appointed. (People v. Mather, 4 Wend. 239, 240; People v. Ratlbun, 21 Wend. 541.),No exception lies to the decision of the triers (Smith v. Floyd, 18 Barb. 522; Purple v. Horton, 13 Wend. 23; see People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 308), nor to that of the court 466,TRIAL BY JJURY.
when acting by consent in the place of triers on a chal- lenge for favor. (Sanchez v. People, 22 N. Y. 147; Costigan v. Ctuyler, 21 id. 134; compare Stout v. People, sp. t., 4 park. Or. 132.) The triers should be instructed by the court as to the principles which should govern them. And an exception will lie to the instructions of the judge to the triers (Peo- pie v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 309; Freeman v. People, 4 id. 9), and to his decisions in regard to the admission of evidence for their guidance (ib.); but not to his refusal to receive evidence of a particular kind, when he is himself acting as trier. (Costigan v. Cuyler, 21 N. Y. 134.) Perhaps er.ors of the triers may be reviewed on a motion for a new trial upon a case made. (See Purple v. Horton, 13 Wend. 23.) The challenges of the party who challenges first, must be first tried. (1 Burr. Pr. 455; 1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 308.) Jurors might always be examined under oath in regard to the matters for which they are challenged (People v. Christie, 2 Abb. 256; Pringle v. Huse, 1 Cow. 432), unless they tend to disgrace them (3 Blacks. Corn. 364; Rex v. Ednonds, 4 Barn. & Aid. 471), an exception which, we think, is superseded by the spirit of the Code in regard to witnesses generally. If the triers are in doubt as to the impartiality of the juror, they should find him not impartial. (4 City H. Rec. 81; see Freeman v. People, 4 Denio, 9.) Peremptory elzallenges.]-Each party may make two peremptory challenges, without any cause shown (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 719; Laws 1847, clt. 134), and no more. A peremptory challenge waives all prior challenges to the same juror. (F.eemnan v. People, 4 Denio, 9.),AMT. 14.-Right to begin. It is often of great practical advantage to possess the ight to begin on the trial, inasmuch as the party who,467 TBIAL BY JUBY.
Right to begin. When plaintiff to begin. begins has the right to make the closing address to the jury, which may, in a doubtful case, exercise an impor. tant influence upon them. (See Ashby v. Bates, 15 Mees. & W. 594.),The party upon whom the affirmative of the issue lies, is entitled to begin (Huntington v. Conkey, 33 Barb. 218; Geach v. Ingall, 14 Mees. & W. 95; Mercer v. WhaTi, 5 Q. B. 447), and may be compelled to begin, against his will (Slauson v. Englehart, 34 Barb. 198; Brandford v. Freeman, 5 Exch. 734; Coxhead v. Huish, 7 Carr. & P. 63; Sandford v. Hunt, 1 id. 118); although, in general, for the reasons before stated, it is considered a privilege to be allowed to open the case. The substance of the issue, and not merely the form of the pleadings, is to be con- sidered, in determining upon whom the affirmative of the issue rests (Ashby v. Bates. 15 Mees. & W. 589); and the test for this purpose is, to ascertain which party would, if no evidence were given, be entitled to a verdict (Geach v. Ingall, 14 Mees. & W. 100; Leete v. Greshiam Ins. Co., 15 Jur. 1161; see Booth v. Millns, 15 Mees. & W. 669; Chapman v. Rawson, 8 Q. B. 673), for the full amount of his claim; for if his cause of action only stands admitted, and the amount of his recovery may be disputed, the plaintiff has always the right to begin. (Huntington v. Conkey, 33 Barb. 218; Fry v. Bennett, 3 Bosw. 200, 232; Mercer v. Whall, 5 Q. B. 447; overruling some nisi prius cases.),When plaintiff to begin.]-In the great majority of cases, the plaintiff has the right and ought to begin. For he has this right whenever he has anything whatever to prove affirmatively, in order to obtain the judgment which he seeks. (Mercer v. Whall, 5 Q. B. 447; Ayerv. Austin, 6 Pick. 225.) Nor can the defendant gain the right to begin by waiving at the trial all his negative defenses. (Pontifex v. Jolly, 9 Car. & P. 202.),In all actions for unliquidated damages, the plaintif 468

B. 447; Littlejohn v. Greeley, sp. t., 13 Abb. 41; Fry v. Bennett, 3 Bosw. 200, 232), unless the defendant is willing to liquidate the damages at the sum demanded by the plaintiff, in case the latter recovers anything at all, and the plaintiff's right to begin arises solely from the action being for unliquidated damages. (Burrell v. Nichol- son, 1 Moo. & Rob. 304; see Harnett v. Jolhson, 9 Carr. & P. 206; Chapman v. Rawson, 8 Q. B. 673; Morris v. Lotan, I Moo. & Rob. 233; Lacon v. Higgins, 3 Stark. 178.),Whten defendant to begin.]--When the defendant admits, in his answer (see Pontifex v. Jolly, 9 Carr. & P. 202; Ayer v. Austin, 6 Pick. 225), the whole of the plainrtiff's case (see ante, p. 468; Doe v. Wilsonl, 1 Moo. & Rob. 323; Doe v. Ttcker, Moo. & M. 536; Doe v. Bray, Moo. & 6M. 166), and relies for his defense solely upon new matter in avoidance (Cannam v. Farmer, 3 Exch. 698; Lambert v. Hale, 9 Carr. & P. 506; Barker v. Malcolm, 7 id. 101; Coxhead v. tuish, 7 id. 63; Sandford v. Hunt, 1 id. 118), he is entitled to begin (ib.), unless the plaintiff in his turn confesses and avoids such defense. Thus, where the sole defense is payment (Coxhead v. Huish; Sandford v. Hunt, supra; Smnart v. Rayner, 6 Oarr. & P. 721), release, discharge in bankruptcy or in- solvency, want of capacity to enter into the contract sued upon (Cannam v. Farmer, 3 Exch. 698), want of considera- tion (Mills v. Oddy. 6 Carr. & P. 728; see Faith v. M'Intyre, 7 Carr. & P. 44; Bing7ham v. Stanley, 9 id. 374), alteration of the instrument sued upon (Barker v. Malcohl, 7 Carr. & P. 101), nonjoinder of a necessary party (Fowler v. Cos- ter, 3 Carr. & P. 463), ora counterclaim of any kind (CQx- head v. Huish, 7 Carr. & P. 63), or any of these defenses combined (ib.), the defendant is entitled to begin. The defendant may begin, even in an action for unliqui- dated damages, if the plaintiff will not engage, upon the,469
opening of the trial, to give evidence of substantial dam. age, and if the case is otherwise within the rules here stated. (Chapman v. Rawson, 8 Q. B. 673.),It has been held, that in an action for land, where the plaintiff claims as heir, and the defendant as devisee of the same person, the defendant may begin. (Goodtitle v. Bra. ham, 4 T. R. 497; see Sutton v. Sadler, 3 0. B. [N. S.] 87;),Renzedy against erroneousdecision.]t-The rule in England is that no exception will lie to the decision of the judge as to the order in which the respective parties shall take part in the trial (see Geach v. Ingal, 14 Mees. & W. 99; but see Doe v. Brayne, 5 C. B. 669); but such an error will be reviewed on motion for a new trial upon a case (Ashby v. Bates, 15 Mees. & W. 589; Doe v. Brayne, 5 C. B. 355; see Geach v. Ingall, 14 Mees. &. W. 95; Huckman v. Per. nie, 3 id. 517), provided clear and manifest wrong had been done thereby and not otherwise. (Brandford v. Free man, 5 Exch. 734; Edwards v. Matthews, 16 L. J. [Exch.] 291; see Geach v. Ingall, 14 Mees. & W. 95.),But in this state, it has been held that an error in this respect is a good gound for exception and appeal (HBnt- ington v. Conkey, 33 Barb. 218), unless it is clear that no injury has resulted therefrom. (Ib.),We apprehend that the English doctrine is the more correct, and that such an error is not a proper subject of exception, but only to be brought before the court for review upon a case; for the importance of the question arises solely from the fact of the opening party having the last word with the jury; and a refusal to allow counsel to address the jury at all is not a ground of exception. (People v. Cook, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 67.) But we think, a it is said in Huntington v. Conkey, that the error should be disregarded only when it is clear that it has done no injury. 470,TRIAL BY JURY.
statement of the case to the jury. Plaintiff's evidence.,ART. 15.-Statement of tlie case to t7hejury. By plaintiff.]-Assuming that the plaintiff is to begin, as he generally does (see ante, p. 468), his counsel will proceed to open the case to the jury, stating the substance of the issue and the nature of the evidence which he expects to adduce (1 Burr. Pr. 234; 1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 271); and he may state the nature of the defense so far as it is necessary to show the precise issue (see Ayrault v. Chtamberlain, 33 Barb. 229), but he need not, and ought not, in this state, to state the facts which he intends to prove in rebuttal of the defendant's case (ib.), as he is, perhaps, required to do in England. (See 1 Arcl7b. Pr. 7th e. 271.) By defendant.]-After thi plaintiff has put in his evi- dence and rested, the defendant, unless lie moves for and obtains a nonsuit (as to which, see post, art. 18), or a dis- missal of the complaint, states briefly the nature of the defense to the jury. Generally.]-Counsel will not be allowed to state in their addresses, facts which they do not expect to prove. (Stevens v. Webb, 7 Carr. & P. 60.) Though the opening address ought of course to state the nature of the case and of the evidence correctly, yet evidence cannot be excluded on the sole ground that it is not within the case stated in the opening (Nearing v. Bell, 5 Hill, 291.) Nor will admissions, inadvertently made in the course of the opening, be treated as evidence of facts against the client. (Machell v. Ellis, 1 Carr. & K. 682.),ART. 16.-Testimony. The general rules of evidence must of course be sought for in works devoted to that special subject. But the rules of practice which govern the examination of wit- nesses are proper to be stated here, in a brief manner.,471
Testimony. Plaintiff's evidence. Evidence in reply. Plaintiff's evidence.l--The party beginning, whom we shall assume to be the plaintiff, call his witnesses as soon as he has finished his address to the jury. The witness, if not objected to and set aside as incompetent, which can now be rarely the case is sworn by the clerk, in one of the forms prescribed by statute (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 692; [2 id. 407]), and is then examined in chief by the plaintift cross-examined by the defendant, and re-examined, if necessary, by the plaintiff.,The party who begins must, regularly speaking, exhaus all his testimony in support of the issue on his side, before resting his case (Ford v. Niles, 1 Hill, 300; Leland v. Bennett, 5 Hill, 286; Hastings v. Palmer, 20 Wend. 225), and cannot introduce new evidence of an affirmative nature in his reply to the defense (ib.), unless by permis- sion of the judge. (See ib.; Wright v. Henry, 4 Hill, 205, note.) The fact that a witness left the court without per. mission, does not entitle the party who summoned him to examine him on matters belonging to the affirmative of the issue, after resting his case. (Ford v. Niles, 1 Hill, 300.),Defendant's evidence.]-After the plaintiff has rested, and the defendant has stated his case to the jury, he calls his witnesses, and goes through the same process with them, as the plaintiff has done, subject to the same rules,Evidence in reply.]-The plaintiff may, after the defend- ant has rested, produce evidence in negation or avoidance of the testimony for the defense. But, as already men- tioned, he cannot, as matter of right, introduce evidentc in support of the affimative of the issae, even to supply a defect in his former'evidence. (Leland v. Bennett, 5 Hill, 286; Rex v. Hilditch, 5 Carr. & P. 299; Briggs v. Ayis- worth, 2 Moo. & R. 168, note.),Rebttting evidence.]--If the evidence in reply is partly in avoidance of the defendant's evidence, it may in 0s far be rebutted by new evidence, but no further. 472
TEstimony. In general. Examination of witnes.ee. In general.]-It lies in the discretion of the court to permit a party to introduce further evidence after he has rested his case (Peckhamn v. Leary, 6 Duer, 494), or even after the testimony of all parties has been declared closed (Anlthony v. Smith, 4 Bosw. 503; Burger v. Wiite, 2 Bosw. 92; Kalle v. People, 4 Park. Cr. 591; Harpell v. Curtis, 1 B. D. Smith, 78; Mercer v. Sayre, 7 Johns. 306), or to refuse such permission (Williams v. Hayes, 20 N.Y. 58; see Ci7ancel v. Barclay, 1 E. D. Smith, 384); and no exception will lie to the decision of the judge on this subject (ib.*), though it may be reviewed on motion for a new trial upon a case. (Anthony v. Smith, 4 Bosw. 503; Mercer v. Sayre, 7 Johns. 306.),But if, when a party rests, the judge recalls one of his witnesses, and elicits evidence unfavorable to him, his case is thereby re-opened, and he has an absolute right to introduce new evidence to strengthen it. (Shelard v. Potter, 4 Hill, 202.),The judge may, in the exercise of a like discretion, limit the number of witnesses to be examined as to one par- ticular point. (Anthony v. Smith, 4 Bosw. 503.) Examination of witnesses.]-Only one counsel on each side is allowed to examinelor cross-examine any one wit- ness, unless by special permission of the judge (Rule 30, Stpreme Ct.), but successive witnesses may be examined by different counsel. (See 1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed. 272.),Unless by special permission of the judge, counsel are not allowed to sit while examining witnesses, nor may the examining counsel take down their testimony, but that must be done, if at all, by one of the other counsel. (Rule 30, Supreme Ct.) Direct examination.]-On a direct examination, i. e., the examination of a witness by the party calling him, lead- * Lewis v. Ryder (13 Abb. 1), was a case of appeal from a justice's court, in which the appellate oourt can, perhaps, review matters of discretion.,60,473
ing questions are not usually allowed (1 Greenl. Et. Â§ 434), unless the witness is plainly an unfriendly one, in which case they are generally allowed (Bank of N. Liberties v. Davis, 6 Watts & S. 285; Clarke v. Saffery, Ry. & Moo. 126, Reg. v. Clapman, 8'0arr. & P. 558; see Beg. v. Ba, id. 745), and in any case it is in the discretion of the court to allow (Budlong v. Fan Nostrand, 24 Barb. 25; CJiney v. Arnold, 18 Barb. 434;* Moody v. Rowel, 17 Pick. 490), or exclude them (Walker v. Dunspaugh, 20 N. Y. 170), and to decide what are, and what are not, leading questions (Ib.),Cross-examination.]-On cross-examination, it is usual to allow leading questions, but this also is a matter of discretion (Walker v. Dunspaugh, 20 N. Y. 170), not re viewable upon exceptions. (Ib.),A witness can be cross-examined not only with refer- ence to the subjects upon which he has been examined in chief, but generally as to any matters connected with the issue. (Jackson v. Yarick, 7 Cow. 238 ; affirmed, 2 Wend. 166; Fulton Bank v. Stafford, id. 483; see Peckham v. Leary, 6 Duer, 497.),The court may stop a cross-examination altogether, when it is perverted by counsel into a mere waste of time, by asking a succession of irrelevant and imperti- nent questions (Peck v. Richmond, 2 E. D. Smith, 380; see Plato v. Kelly, 16 Abb. 188); but this power must be very cautiously exercised, and only in a clear case. (Ib.),Re-examination.]-A witness may be re-examined by the party calling him, at the close of his cross-examina- tion, and the court may, in its discretion, permit a witness to be recalled to the stand, after he has left it (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 285; Stacy v. Graham, 3 Duer, 444;? * Affirmed on other grounds, 15 N. Y. 345. t firmed, 24 N. Y. 607. Affirmed, 14 N. Y. 492. 474,TRIAL BY JURY.
Testimony. Proceedings where parties are wanting. Breidert v. Vincent, 1 E. D. Smith, 542; Adams v. Ban- kart, 1 Cr. MI. & R. 681), or refuse to do so (Treadwell v. tebbins, 6 Bosw. 538; People v. Rector, 19 Wend. 577; Laws v. .Merrills, 6 id. 280), and no exception lies to its decision (ib.), though it may be reviewed upon a case made. (Treadwell v. Stebbins, supra.),When a re-examination is had as a matter of right, after a cross-examination, it must in general be confined to the subject of the cross-examination. (Queen's case, 2 Brod. & B. 297; see Prince v. Samo, 7 Ad. & El. 627; Blewett v. Fregonning, 3 id. 554.) ABT. 17.-Proceedings where necessary parties are wanting.,It is sometimes found, upon the trial, that no complete determination of the controversy can be made without adjudicating upon the rights of persons who are not parties to the action. If such defect of parties appeared upon the face of the complaint, and the defendant did not de- mur on that ground (see ante, p. ), or if, it not so appearing, it was, nevertheless, known to the defendant, and he did not set it up in his answer (see ante, p. ) he waives the defect so far as his own rights are con- cerned; but if the rights of the third party would be in any way affected by a judgment in the cause, the court must interfere and require such party to be brought in (Slaver v. Brainard, 29 Barb. 25; Pow'el v. Finch, 5 Duer, 666; Davis v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 2 Duer, 663), unless a final judgment can be rendered saving his rights. (Code, 122.) If the defendant has raised the objection in his answer, the complaint ought generally to be dismissed (Van Epps v. Van Deusen, 4 Paige, 64, 76), though the court may, upon terms, order the cause to stand over for amendment. (See ib.) If the defect was not set up in the answer, the complaint should never be dismissed, but the cause should stand over for the proper amendment (Davis v. Mayor of,475
N. Y., sp. t., 2 Duer, 663;* Tanderwerker v. Yanderwerker, sp. t., 7 Barb. 221; FVa Elpps v. Van Deusel, 4 Paige, 64; O'Brien v. Heeney, 2 Edw. 242; Colt v. Lasnier, 9 Cow. 334; Harding v. Handy, 11 Wheat. 163), and, ifthe defendant knew of the defect in time to set it up by de- murrer or answer, no costs should be imposed on the plaintiff. (Colt v. Lasnier, supra.) So if neither party was aware of the defect before the trial, no costs should be imposed.,When the cause is thus ordered to stand over, the plain. tiff must either procure a voluntary appearance from the party to be brought in, or must serve him with an amended summons and complaint (Akin v. Albany Northern R. R., 14 How. 337), which must also be served on all the other defendants, who have the usual time to answer anew. (lb.),ART. 18.-Nonsuit. A nonsuit may be either voluntary or involuntary on the part of the plaintiff.,Voluntary snosuit.]-The plaintiff may find it expedient to allow himself to be nonsuited, for the purpose of avoid- ing a verdict against him; as for instance when his wit- nesses are absent, and he cannot obtain a postponement, or when for any other reason his evidence is defective. For a nonsuit does not preclude him from bringing a new action.,The court may nonsuit the plaintiff of its own motion (see Treacher v. Hinton, 4 Barn. & Ald. 413); but there seems to be no precedent for granting a nonsuit on the plaintiff's application. The plaintiff, if he desires to be nonsuited, may generally secure such a result by absent ing himself when the cause is called, though this may not suffice when the defendant seeks affirmative relief.,* Affirmed, 3 Duer, i19; reversed on other grounds, 14 N. Y. 506 476,TRIAL BY JURY.
Nonsuit. Voluntary nonsuit. Compulsory nonsuit. Formerly, the plaintiff could secure a nonsuit in nearly all cases, even after the jury had agreed upon their ver- dict, by absenting himself when they returned into court (Wooster v. Burr, 2 Wend. 295; Gale v. boysradt, sp. t., 1 How. 72); but this privilege is now taken from him, and he cannot insist upon being nonsuited, after the jury have left the bar to consider of their verdict. (Rule 31, Su- preme Ct.),A plaintiff who consents to a nonsuit cannot appeal therefrom, even though he gave such consent in conse- quence of an erroneous decision of the judge, which made it useless for him to proceed. (Fan Wormer v. Mayor of Albany, 18 Wend. 169.) He may, perhaps, obtain relief by motion upon a case (ib.; Alexander v. Barker, 2 Cr. & Jer. 136); but not even in that way, when his reason for submitting to a nonsuit was because he feared the effects of the judge's comments on his case. (Simpson v. Clayton, 2 Bing. N. C. 467; Austin v. Evans, 2 Man. & Gr. 430.) Compulsory nonsuit.]-Contrary to the English practice (Dewar v. Purday, 3 Ad. & El. 166; Watkins v. Towers, 2 T. R. 281; Minchin v. Clement, 1 Barn. & Ald. 252), the plaintiff may, in this state, be nonsuited against his will. (See Labar v. Koplin, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 547; Van Wormer v. Mayor of Albany, 18 Wend. 169; Pratt v. Hull, 13 Johns. 334.). It is the duty of the court to nonsuit the plaintiff when- ever the evidence adduced by him is insufficient to warrant a verdict in his favor (Steves v. Oswego & Syr. R. R. Co., 18 N. Y. 422; Morrison v. N. Y. & N. Haven R. B. Co., 32 Barb. 568; Carpenter v. Smith, 10 Barb. 663; Doane v. Eddy, 16 Wend. 523; Wilson v. Williams, 14 id. 246; Deneyer v. Souzer, 6 id. 436; Stuart v. Simplson, 1 id. 376), as where the plaintiff establishes only a possibility of the facts which are essential to maintain his action. (Sheldon v. Hudson River R. R., 29 Barb. 226; Trew v.,477
Nonsuit. Compulsory nonsuit. In what cases. Railway Passengers' Assurance Co., 5 Hurl. & N. 211.). And a nonsuit must be ordered, even upon the defend. ant's evidence, when it is so cogent, that it is quite cleat that a verdict for the plaintiff would be set aside. (Lonle v. MIeeker, 25 N. Y. 361; Rudd v. Davis, 3 Hill, 287; affirmed, 7 id. 529; Sheldoni v. Hudson River R. R., 29 Barb. 226; Jansen v. Acker, 23 Wend. 480; Fort v. Col lins, 21 Wend. 109; see Wilks v. Hudson River R. R., 24 N. Y. 430; 23 How. 492; Bidcell v. Lament, 17 How. 357; Ernst v. Hudson River R. B. [Ot. of Appeals], 24 How. 97.),But a nonsuit should not be ordered, if the evidence shows that the plaintiff is entitled to recover anything, even though merely nominal damages (}ran Rensselaer v, Jewett, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 135); nor upon a mere conflict of evidence (Labar v. Kooplin, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.], 547), nor if the facts are in any degree doubtful (Keller v. N. Y. Central R. R. [Ct. of Appeals], 24 How. 172; Bernhlardt v. Renss. & Saratoga R. R., 32 Barb. 165; 19 How. 199;t see Austin v. Hudson River R. R., 25 N. Y. 347); nor be. cause the judge discredits some of the plaintiff's wit- nesses (Merritt v. Lyon, 3 Barb. 110), for the jury are the proper judges of the credibility of witnesses (ib.; Labar v. olplin, supra); nor unless the case is so entirely clear, that even if two successive juries should find for the plaintiff, their verdicts would be set aside. (See IHaring v. N. Y. & Erie R. R., 13 Barb. 16.),The plaintiff may be nonsuited as to one of several claims united in his complaint, and recover as to the rest (Packard v. Hill, 7 Cow. 434.)t So he may be nonsuited as to one of several defendants (Jones v. Gibson, 5 Barn. & Cr. 768); and we think he may be on the motion of a defendant whose codefendant has failed to answer, for though the decisions in this state (Yates v. Lansing, 8,* Reversed on other grounds. (6 1. & N. 839.) t Affirmed in Court of Appeals. (See 24 N. Y. 445.) t Affirmed on other grotaids. (5 Wend. 375.) 478
Johns. 289; McGregor v. Cleveland, 10 Wend. 596), and a confirmatory dictum (Beaman v. Blanchard, 4 Wend. 432), are to the contrary, yet those cases are founded upon no reasoning, but solely upon some English decisions (Han- nay v. Smith, 3 T. R. 662; Harris v. Bitterlcy, Cowl. 483), which have been overruled in all the English courts. (Haddrick v. Heslop, 12 Q. B. 267; Stuart v. Rogers, 4 Mees. & W. 649; Mutrphy v. Donlan, 5 Barn. & Cr. 178.) Since the foregoing was written, the rule has been con- clusively settled in accordance with the views here ex- pressed. (Lomer v. M1eker, 25 N. Y. 361.) The motion.]-The motion for a nonsuit is made by the defendant at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, or after all the testimony is in. If made while the exami- nation of a witness is proceeding, it may be denied on that ground alone. (Winficld v. Potter, 24 How. 466.) In moving for a nonsuit, care should be taken to state the precise grounds of the motion; and where there are several distinct grounds, they should be separately stated. A mere general motion will not bring up for review any questions of form or variance. (Castle v. Duryea, 32 Barb. 480.) And a nonsuit demanded on behalf of all the defendants generally, is properly denied if there is evi- dence sufficient to charge any one of them. (WIoodblurn v. Ckiamberlin, 17 Barb. 446.) Tile decision.]-The judge has only a limited discretion in regard to the motion. A refusal to nonsuit in a case in which a nonsuit would be proper, is good ground for an exception (Carpenter v. Smith, 10 Barb. 663; see Morrison v. N. Y. & N. Haven R. B. Co., 32 Barb. 568), and so, of course, is a compul- sory nonsuit in a case in which it should not have been granted. (See Rider v. Pond, 19 N. Y. 262.) The judge may, in his discretion, permit the plaintiff, after a nonsuit has been moved for, to give additional,479 TRIAL BY JURY.
evidence for the purpose of removing the ground of the motion (Hunt v. Maybee, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 266), or may reserve his decision until the close of the whole testi. mony; and if, after the motion is made, and thus reserved or denied, evidence is given by the plaintiff (ib.; Schenec tady & Saratoga Plankroad Co. v. Tha7tcher, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 102, 112; Kent v. Harcourt, 33 Barb. 495; Breidert v. Vincent, 1 E. D. Smith, 542; Lansing v. I an Alstyne, 2 Wend. 561), or by the defendant (Barrick v. AIstin, 21 Barb. 241; lMayor of N. Y. v. fMason, 1 Abb. 344; 4 E. D. Smith, 142; Colvin v. Burnet, 2 Hill, 620; Jaclson v. Leggett, 7 Wend. 377), which sustains the plaintiff's right of action, the defendant cannot complain of the refusal of a nonstit, even though, at the time he moved for it, the plaintiff had not shown a cause of action.,The plaintiff cannot, technically speaking, be nonslited Oil account of defects in his pleadings (Ct. of Errors, Safford v. Stcrens, 2 Wend. 158), but, under the Code, the complaint may be dismissed on the trial, if it does not state a cause of action (Bridge v. Payson, 5 Sands. 210), and the distinction between a dismissal of the complaint and a nonsuit is, practically, merely a verbal one.,ART. 18.-Wlithdrawing a juror. It sometimes happens that unexpected difficulties arise upon the trial which make it undesirable to proceed, and which are, nevertheless, not entirely fatal to the plain- tiff's claim. In such case the judge may, in his sound discretion, whether with or without the consent of the defendant, allow the plaintiff to withdraw a juror (People v. Ellis, 15 Wend. 371; People v. Jfudges of N. ., 8 Cow. 127; see People v. Olcott, 2 Johns. Cas. 301), and order the cause to be retained upon the calendar. (Ib.) But unless he so orders, the withdrawal of a juror puts an end to the action (1 Archb. Pr. 7thl ed. 285), without costs to either party (Stodhard v. Johnson, 3 T. R. 657), though it is no bar to a new action for the same cause. (Sanderson v. 480,TRIAL BY JURY.
Nestor, Ry. & M. 402; see Harries v. Thomas, 2 Mees. & W. 32; Everett v. Youells, 3 Barn. & Ad. 349.) If, how- ever, the juror is withdrawn under an agreement, express or tacit, that the controversy shall be terminated without farther litigation, a second action will be stayed. (Moscati v. Lawson, 4 Ad. & El. 331; see Harries v. T7onas, 2 Mees. & W. 32.),AnT. 19.-Submission of specific questions to t7he jury. In all cases, the court may instruct the jury, if they find a general verdict, to make a written or oral finding upon particular questions of fact to be stated in writing. (Code, (261.) The findings of the jury upon such questions must be filed with the clerk, and entered upon the minutes (ib.), and such findings control the general verdict. (Code,,AnT. 20.-Summing ap. After all the testimony is in, the counsel on both sides proceed to sum up the case to the jury, unless the court refuses to permit them to address the jury, as it may, in the exercise of a sound discretion (People v. Cook, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 77), which is reviewable only by motion for a new trial upon a case, and not upon exceptions. (lb.) i Where the evidence is such as to make it proper for the judge to direct a verdict for one or other of the parties, he will not allow counsel to address the jury. (See People v. Cook, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 77.) The party who begins on the trial is entitled to the closing address, unless the other party introduces no evi- dence, in which case the latter may sum up as soon as the former has rested, and no reply will be allowed (Faith v. Pilntyre, 7 Can'. & P. 44; Pullen v. White, 3 id. 434); though if, in summing up, counsel assert facts which are not in evidence, the adverse party may be allowed to reply. (Crerar v.

(Ib.),AI:T. 21.-The chaurge. When all the evidence is in, and tile counsel on both sides have slu:incd up, it is an invariable practice for the judge to charge the jury, without being requested to do so; thougl he is not bound to do so without request. (See IItiapt v. Pohltmalnl, 16 Abb. 301.) ie ecannot be required to instruct tile jury concerning the effect of evidence, at the time it is given. Ie has a right to reserve all his instructions until his linal charge. (Raymond v. Holwland, 17 Wend. 389.),The main purpose of the charge is to separate tle ques- tilns of law firom tlhe matters of fact, andl to present an impartial view of thle whole case to the jury, so that they shall have a clear understanding of what they are called upon to decide, and the principles upon whlich they should act,,Though tle judge may express his opinion upon any question of fact submitted to tile jury (lagyer v. IHayer, 38 Barb. 92; Althof v. iiof, 2 Hilt. 344; Bruce v. Wester- ceit, 2 E. D. Smith, 440, 461; Dur7ee v. i(ars7all, 7 Wend. 312; JTecksosl v. Packard, 6 id. 415; see Blr77cehy v. Ketcl- tas, 4 Sands. 450; Chesebrough v. Taylor, 12 Abb. 227), he must make the jury clearly understand that it is his ol)iJlionl merely, and not a direction Twhich they are bound to follow (N Y. .Firemen's Ins. Co. v. V lWalle, [Ct. of Errors], 12 Jolms. 513; Read v. Ilurd(, 7 Wend. 408), unless the proof is so conclusive tllat a verdict against his opinion would be set aside as against evidence, in which case he may and should give them positive instructions which way to find their verdict. (Iferring v. IHoppock, 15 N. Y. 409; Besson v. Southard, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 236; GocctV. Ross, 15 Abb. 251.) And he is not bound to express any 482
opinion upon a question of fact not thus conclusively determined by the evidence. (2l'oore v. Meacham, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 207.) The judge is not at liberty to state his opinion on any question, upon the supposition that it is a matter ol law, and afterwards to submit it to the jury as a question of fict. If it is a matter of fact, lie ought t not to express his conclusions thereon-if it is a matter of law, he ouglht not to leave it to the jury. ( redder v. Fellows, 20 N. Y. 12(.) Although the credibility of witnesses is a (luestion proper for the decision of the jury (Con rad v. lFillitar s, 6 Hill, 441; see S(itkelt v. ;Slncer, 29 Barb. 180), yet the ju(lge must instruct the jury as to tile principles upoln lwhich thley shluld( determine suchl credibility (Du)lol v. Patter- son, 5 Cow. 243), andl when a witness shows himnself, by his own acts, to be llalifestly unworthy of credit, the judge should so instruct the jury. (Ib.),The judge must not leave the jury to determine upon the existence of a fact, of which there is no evidence. (Nona;es v. Peolec, 25 N. Y. 380; Irhlite v. StiNli,, id. i54l; Storey v. Brelnnan, 15 N. Y. 524; Gale v, Wells, 12 Barb. 84; Umderbill v.. Y. . J Harldem R1. R1. Co., 21 id. 489.) In actions for unliquidated damages, the judge may inform the jury what amount will carry costs (Wll'ale v. Dillebeck, 39 Barb. 123; Nolton v. 3bo.ses, 3 id. 31), andl ought to do so if requested by the jury (see Elliotl v. Browl,, 2 Wend. 497), nor is it his duty to instruct the jury to disregard that circumstance. (Waffle v. Dilleibec7k, supra.) The judge may comment upon the unwillingness of a party to produce certain evidence, as raising a presump- tion that it is unfavorable to him (HIager v. HIager, 38 Barb. 92; Sutton v. Sadler, 3 0. B. [N. S.] 87), and it is a usual practice to comment upon the omission of a party to call a witness whlo clearly knows latterial facts. (Sutton v. Sadler, supra; see 30 L. J. [Mat. C.] 5.),483 TRIAL BY JURY.
The charge. Requests to charge. Form of request. Requests to charge.]-If a charge is not sufficiently fun or explicit, the party aggrieved should request the judge to give such instructions as the case may require. (Haarry v. Northern Indiana R. R. Co., 20 N. Y. 232; City of New York v. Price, 5 Sands. 549; see Springsteed v. Lawson,14 Abb. 328; 23 How. 302.) If the judge assumes to decide questions which ought to be submitted to the jury, a special request must in like manner be made for its sub. mission to the jury. (Winchell v. Hicks, 18 N. Y. 558; Bidwell v. Lament, 17 How. 357; Wilklow v. Lane, 37 Barb. 244; Dows v. Rush, 28 Barb. 157; see Hotchkins v. Hodge, 38 Barb. 117; Graser v. Stellwagen, 25 N. Y. 315.) Such requests must be specific and separate, so that the court can pass directly upon each (Winehell v. Hicks, supra), and must be in such form that the court can properly charge in the very words of the request, without qualifi. cation, or it may be denied as a whole. (Ct. of Appeals, Keller v. N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co., 24 How. 172; Carpenter v. Stilivell, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 61 ;* Bagley v. Smith, 10 N. Y. 489; 19 How. 1.) But if the points on which a charge is desired are separately stated, a single request will be sufficient to raise them all, with like effect as if a distinct request was made on each point; though if the points are numerous, and the judge fails to charge upon all of them, the party must again call his attention to the points over- looked. (Zabriskie v. Smith, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 322.),The party making such request must, if desired by the court, point out the evidence upon which he bases it. (Kiernan v. Rocheleau, 6 Bosw. 148.),When a proper request is thus made, it is the duty of the judge to charge in accordance therewith (Wilds v. Hudson Riv. R. R. Co., 24 N. Y. 430; 23 How. 492;t Underhill v. N. Y. & Harlem R. R. Co., 21 Barb. 489; Crary v. Marshall, 1 E. D. Smith, 530), unless he has * Reversing S. C., 12 Barb. 128. t Reversing S. C., 33 Barb. 503. ,484,TRIAL BY JURY.

He is not bound, however, to adopt the precise verbiage of the request. It is suffi- cient if he charges in substance in accordance therewith. (First Baptist Churcl v. Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., 23 How. 448.) But if the proposition which he is asked to charge is absolutely correct, and applicable to the casg, he may not add any qualifying words which may tend in any degree to confuse or puzzle the jury. (Wilds v. Hudson River B. R., 24 N. Y. 430; 23 How. 492.),The judge cannot be required to charge upon a hypo- thetical case, entirely unsupported by evidence. (Noakcs v. People, 25 N. Y. 380, 390; Riushmore v. Hall, 12 Abb. 420; City of N Y. v. . Price, 5 Sands. 542; Kiernan v. Roche- leau, 6 Bosw.-148; Partridge v. Gildeneister, id. 57; Clarik v. Force, 19 Wend. 232.) Unless the judge is expressly requested to submit a particular question of fact to the jury, he may decide it. (Wilklow v. Lane, 37 Barb. 244; Dows v. eusJh, 28 id. 157; see Graser v. Stellwagen, 25 N. Y. 315.) Directing a finding.]--Where the undisputed evidence is all one way (Besson v. SoLutuard, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 236; People v. Cook, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 67; aff'g S. 0., 14 Barb. 259; Porter v. Havens, 37 Barb. 343), or where there is such a preponderance of evidence on one side that a ver- dict to the contrary would be set aside as against evi- dence, the judge may direct the jury to find a verdict in accordance with his views of the evidence (Herring v. SIoppoek, 15 N. Y. 409; aff'g S. 0., 3 Duer, 20; Moore v. Westervelt, 1 Bosw. 357; * Godin v. Bank of Comnmonwealtth, 6 Dner, 76), and must do so, if duly requested. (Storey v. Brennan, 15 N. Y. 524; Goelet v. Ross, 15 Abb. 251; see,* Revcrsed on other grounds, 21 N. Y. 103.,485 TRIAL BY JURY.
--------L------ --- People v. Peck, 35 Barb. 651; 14 Abb. 158.) But unless the evidence is thus conclusive, the judge is not at liberty to give tile jury a positive direction as to their verdict. (Bridgleporit BanU v. Empire Stone Drcssing Co., 30 Barb. 421; 1]) low. S. o51; St. Jon v. Mayor of N. Y., 6 Duer, 315 ; 13 1How. 527; see Sac7;ett v. Spencer, 39 Barb. 180; B3ern ard v. ]r'nnerc, 4 Bosw. 528; Craiford v. IVilso8l, 4 Barb. 504; Rich v. Rich, 16 Wend. 663, 676.),A1'rT. 22.--Co.sul7tation of the jury. The jlg having charged the jury, they proceed to consult upon tleir verdict. Thlis they may do in their box in court, but it they cannot agrece at once, they are sient out by the court inl charge of an ollicer, who is sworn to keep theml without any intermission, refreshment, fire, or light, other than such as may be allowed by the court, and without communll ication with any other person, until they agrec upon their verdict.,Thlee jlg may, Iat the request of the jury, visit them during their retiremen;t to instruct themn upon any ques- tion of law (Tlhayer v. Toa Yklet, 5 Johns. 111), irovided lie is accompanied by the counsel for all the parties; but not otherwise, unless by express consent* (Moody v. Poni- eroy, 4 D)enio, 115; Taylor v. etsdford, 13 Johns. 487; Benson v. C!ark;, 1 Cow. 258; see BItni v. Cro1u, 10 Johns. 239), or unless counsel, being invited to attend, refuse to do so. (lioqers v. MlIoul7throp, 13 Wend. 274.) The usual and more correct practice in such cases is to recall the jury into court and there give them such instructions as they require, in the presence of counsel.,No other person than the judge or the officer in charge may visit theln during their consultation.,* A consent to the judge's visiting the jury implies a consent to his giving them instructions, since they could not well want him for any other pur- pose. (Ilancock v. Salmon, 8 Barb. 5G4.) 486,TRIAL BY JURY.
Consultation of the jury. Persuasions to agree. Of course the jury may not receive additional testimony in private (Metcalf v. Deane, Cro. Eliz. 189; see Brown v. (Cowdel, 12 Johns. 384), except by consent of the parties, which cures the error (Brown v. Cowell, supra), but they may, of their own accord, return into court and require further evidence to be giveln up1on a point of which they are in doubt. (2 Rol. Abr. 67(; see Blackley v. ASrtelon,, 7 Johns. 32.) And a witness may be taken to the jury-room to give further evidence, an opportunity being griven to all parties to be present. (IlHnlowl v. Leonar)d, 7 Johns. 200.) The court may, in its discretion, allow the jury to take with them any documentary evidence given at the trial (JIowlnad v. lFillcts, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 170); alld though they have no right to do so without permlission, it seems that even their doing so would not affeet the ver- dict. (See ib.) Nor will a verdict be set aside on account of the jury having taken with them a paper not given in evidence, if it is perfectly clear that it did not inflluence their verdict. (Ierritt v. Brinlc;rlirof; 17 Johns. 323; IHac7i/ v. llastic, 3 id. 252.) But the jury cannot be allowed (without general con- sent) to take with them the minutes of evidence lkept by counsel on one side (Duirfee v. Jc eindl, S Barb. 46), and a verdict in favor of the party to whom such minutes belonged, cannot stand, in case the jury do so, unless it is clearly shown that no injury was done. (b1.) Even the minutes of the judge may not be given to the jury without the consent of all the parties. (Ncil v. Abet, 24 Wend. 185.) Persuasions to agree.]-Tlie judge may, in case of a disagreement among the jury, use any fair arguments to impress upon them the propriety of coming to an under- standing; but he may not use any form of coercion, as by threatening them with long detention, or other inconvenience. (Green v. Teifair, sp. t., 11 How. 260.),4.87
Consultation of jury. Misconduct of jury. Mode of determination.]-The jury are not at liberty to adopt any mode of deciding upon their verdict, which avoids or abridges the exercise of their individual judg- ment.,Thus, they may not decide by lot (Mitchell v. Elle, 10 Wend. 595; Hale v. Cove, 1 Strange, 642; Phillips v. Fowler, Barnes, 441), nor by putting down, each one, such amount as he chooses, and dividing the total by the num- ber of jurors (Roberts v. Failis, 1 Cow. 238; Harvey v. Ri7elett, 15 Johns. 87; Smith v. Chteetl7am, 3 Cai. 57), though if they adopt the latter course without any previous understanding that they will abide by the result, and then individually agree to it as their verdict, such verdict may stand. (Dana v. Tucker, 4 Johns. 487; Conllin v. Hill, sp. t., 2 How. 6.),Jury to kleep together.]--The jury are not at liberty to separate from the time that they retire to consult until they render their verdict in court (see Smith v. Thom1pson, 1 Cow. 221), but if they do separate, though their conduct is a contempt of court (Exparte Hill, 3 Cow. 355), yet if there is no suspicion of abuse, their verdict will not be set aside on this ground. (Horton v. Horton, 2 Cow. 589; Smith v. Thompson, 1 id. 221.) The slightest ground for such suspicion is, however, fatal to the verdict. (Oliver v. First Presb. Church, 5 Cow. 283; see Horton v. Horton, supra.),Misconduct of jury.]-If the jurors, or any of them, eat or drink at the expense of the party in whose favor they find, their verdict cannot stand (Co. Litt. 227 b.; see Ba v. Burdett, 12 Mod. 111; 2 Salk. 645; 1 Ld. Raym. 148; Harebottle v. Peacock, Cro. Jac. 21); but not so if they eat at their own expense, or at that of the other party (i.); and the mere fact that one of them drinks intoxicating liquor during the trial is no objection to the verdict, it not appearing that he was actually intoxicated. (Wisog v. Abrahamns, 1 Hill, 207.) 488
Failure to agree.]-In case the jury fail to agree, the judge may, after keeping them for such time as to him seems reasonable, discharge them; and the case may thereupon be put again upon the calendar, for a new trial in due course. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 869; [2 id. 554].),ART. 23.-General verdict. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict, they return into court to render it. The verdict may be, according to circumstances, general, special, or subject to the opinion of the court. We consider first, the nature of a general verdict.,Generl era rdict, w(hat.]-A. general verdict is one by which the jury pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. (Code, Â§ 260.),When allowable.]-A general verdict may be allowed by the court in any case; and may be rendered by the jury, in their own discretion, without regard to the pre- ference of the court, in every action for the recovery of money, or of specific real property. (Code, Â§ 261.) Requisites of verdict.]-The verdict must pass upon all the issues in the cause (AManning v. Monaghan, 23 N. Y. 539; Bemlus v. Beekman [Ct. of Errors], 3 Wend. 667; Boynton v. Page, 13 id. 425), except such as are wholly immaterial. (Bogert v. Vermilya, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 447.) If a finding upon one issue necessarily disposes of another, it is not necessary that there should be any express find- ing upon the latter. (Law v. Merrills [Ct. of Errors], 6 Wend. 268.) It must not be argumentative. (Freeman v. People, 4 Denio, 9, 30.) When a verdict is found in favor of the plaintiff in an action for money, or in favor of the defendant on a pecu-,62,TRIALL BY JURY,,489
niary counterclaim, the jury must assess the amount of the recovery. (Code, Â§ 263.),Whlere there atre several defendants jointly liable, only one of whom answers, the jury assess damages against all at the trial. (VanL Sc7aick v. Trotter, 6 Cow. 599; see Cailin v. Billings, sp. t., 13 How. 511; 4 Abb. 248.),In an action for chattels, if the jury find in favor of the party out of possession, they must assess the value of the property (Code, Â§ 261); anl may, in any such action, assess the damages, if any are claimed by the prevailing party in his plleading, which he hlas sustained by reason of tile taking and detention of the property. (Ib.) lWhen the verdict is in favor of tlhe party in pos- session of the property at tile time of trial, the jury need not assess its value. (Archer v. Bondilet, Code Rep. K1. S. 372; see Woodburln v. Chamberlil, 17 Barb. 446.),Sererilg dna/cgs.]-lWhere several defendants are sued for a wrongful act conmmitted by them jointly, the dalma- ges cannot be severed, apd there can be only one verdict against both. (Beal v. Flinch, 11 N. . .[1 Kern.] 128; 9 How. 385; 0'S7ea v. Kircer, 8 Abb. 69; losw. .) If tlhe jury undertake to sever the damages, the plaintiff may enter up judgment against all the defendants for the largest amount assessed against aly one of them, remit- ting the rest. (O'Shea v. Kirker, supra; see Beal v. Finch, supra.)*,Slbmlission of slecific questions.]-Even in eases where the jury have a right, if they choose, to render a general verdict, the judge may submit to them specific questions of fact, in writing, and require their answer thereto also in writing. (Code, Â§ 261.) This he may do in any action, and without the consent of parties. (Partridge v. Gilbert,,* Compare Turner v. M' Carthy (4 E. D. Smith, 247). 490,TRIABL BYP JURY.
491 General verdict. Submission of questions. Sealed verdict. 3 Duer, 184; 15 N. Y. 601.) The answers to such ques- tions must be filed with the clerk. (Code, Â§ 261.),The findings upon such questions, if inconsistent 'with the general verdict, control it, and the judgment must follow the former to the disregard of tile latter. (Cod(e, Â§ 262.) But in determining this question, the court must regard all the issues, not covered by the specific questions submitted, as decided in favor of the party for whom the general verdict is rendered (U. S. Trust Co . . Harris, 2 Bosw. 75, 87), and it is only the judgmec, tand not the verdict, which can be tlurned against the party in whose favor the jury find generally. (Ib;) The general verdict will not be prejudiced by tile sub- mission of questions which, though irrelevant, cannot have any influence upon the decision of tle jury on the main question. (Forrest v. Forrest, 6 Duer, 102, 147 ; 3 Abb. 144.)* Scaled verdict.]-If the jury are unable to agree upon their verdict by the time the court adjourns, it is usual for the judge to direct the jury to render a sealed verdict. Where this is dlone, the jury agree upon their verdict, reduce it to writing, seal it up with care, and deliver it to the officer in charge of them, after which they may sepa- rate without waiting for the re-opening of court. (1 Burr. Pr. 242; 1 MIonell, 683.) This proceeding is always allowable where none of the parties expressly object to it. (Dounglss v. Tousey, 2 Wend. 352), though whether it may be done where a party objects, does not appear to be decided. The general opinion is that it may. A sealed verdict is no more binding upon the jurors, collectively or individually, than an oral one. Any of them may change their minds before it is entered, and a single dissent nullifies it. (Root v. Sherwood, 6 Johns. 68;,* Affirmed, 25 N. Y. 501.
General verdict. Alteration of verdict. Entry of verdict, see Douglass v. Tousey, 2 Wend. 352.) And such a ver. diet, like an oral one, is of no force until received and entered by the court. (Root v. Sherwood, 6 Johns. 68.),Rendition of verdict.]-The verdict must be delivered in open court by the foreman of the jury, in their pre. sence. This rule applies to a sealed verdict, as well as an oral one. (Root v. Sherwcood, 6 Johns. 68.) Upon the announcement of the verdict by the foreman, any of the jury may dissent, and it is then no verdict.,Alteration of verdict.]-Until the verdict is actually re. ceived and recorded by the court, the jury may alter and correct it at their discretion. (Blackley v. Sheldon, 7 Johns. 32; SaXunders v. Freeman, Plowd. 209.) And the judge may suggest to the jury the propriety of reconsidering their verdict (ib.), though he may not insist upon their doing so.,Polling the jutry.]-Either party may require the jury to be polled, that is, to be called over man by man, and each inquired of whether he agrees to the verdict or not. This is a matter of right, in all cases, whether the verdict be oral or sealed. (Jackson v. Hauwks, 2 Wend. 619; Foz v. Smith, 3 Cow. 23.) But the only question whlich any party can claim to have put to the jurors is simply this: "Is this your verdict?" He is not entitled to ask them, " Is this your verdict against each (or both) of the defend- ants ?" (Labar v. Koplin, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 547.) If upon being polled, any juror answers in the negative, the ver- dict cannot be recorded, but they may be sent out again to consult. (Douglass v. Tousey, 2 Wend. 352.),Entry of verdict.]-It is the duty of the clerk to enter the verdict on the minutes of the court (Code, Â§ 264), to- gether with any special findings of fact (Code, Â§ 261), and he reads it, as recorded, to the jury, calling upon them to hearken to their verdict as recorded by the court, and 492,TRIAL BY JURY.
Special verdict. When proper. Form and contents. adding, " and so say you all." This is the last opportu- nity for jurors to dissent. (Grah. Pr. 3d ed. 785.),ART. 24.--Special verdict. FW7at.]-A special verdict is one bly which the jury finds the facts only, leaving the judgment to the court. (Code, Â§ 260.) Where all the issues, both of fact and of law, are dis- posed of by admissions made at the trial, with a single exception, which is submitted to the jury, and upon which they find "in favor of the plaintiff," without stating any facts, the verdict is a general and not a special one. (Williams v. Willis, sp. t., 7 Abb. 90.),When proper.]-W5hen both the judge and jury agree upon the propriety of putting the verdict in this form, it may be so done in any action whatever, without the con- sent of the parties. (Sec Partridge v. Gilbert, 3 Duer, 184; 15 N. Y. 601.) In actions for the recovery of money only, or of specific real property, the jury have a discretion to render a general or special verdict, whicl the judge can- not control (Code, Â§ 261); but in other actions, the judge may require the jury to find a special verdict upon any or all of the issues. (Ib.),When, in an action triable by the court, particular questions are submitted to a jury, their verdict is a special verdict, and subject to all the rules which govern such proceedings.,Form and contents.]-The requisites of a special verdict are the same under the Code that they were before, (Eisemiann v. Swan, 6 Bosw. 668; Williams v. Willis, sp. t., 7 Abb. 90.) A special verdict must state the material facts proved at the trial, and not mere evidence of such facts. (lill v. Covell, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 522; Sisson v. Barrett, 2 id. 406; Langley v. Warner, 3 id. 327; Seward v. Jackson,493
[Ct. of Errors], 8 Cow. 40i.) It must state facts sullicient to raise, for the consideration of tlle court, a l)ur question of law (Hill v. CoVell, sllpra; .liscinlma v. Siwanl, 6 Bosw. 6(;); and 'f, instead of so doingl, it states mere matter of' .i(Clenlce, from whicl the material facts may, but can. nlot m('cs.sn'i7/, be inferred, there must be a new trial. (llill v. Corel7; Sewardr v. Tackson, supra.) But if it states facts which raise a legal l)resumll)tioll of the exis- tellnc( of all facts necessary to the judicial determination of the contrloversy, it is sullicient. (See .tof/(ers v. Iw(gsle Fire ;s. Co. [t. of Errors], 9 AWend. 011.),It must 1be direct and positive, not argumenltative in fiorm. (See 'renemnt v. lPeoiyj, 4 Denio, 9, .;0.),It Imust ldecide all the questions of ftact at issue (Eise- ma.11 v. ,Slai, 6 iBosw. 668 ; Kii: v. VJ'N.ycal, 1 1)euio, 43(,;; see Mltaii#in v.

(Bul1dey v.

Iattcrs [Ct. of Errors], 8 Cow. i(69!)), as that the deeiilanit did not appear or offer evidence (JIirla(til v.

II'o, pr(l(rd.]-- A special verdict is not usually pre- pared in its filnal shape at the trial, bnt the issues of fact are submitted to the jury in a rough form, and a ]minute of their answers taken by tile judge or counsel; and it' by the latter, such minute should be giveln by him to the judge.,The party intendling to move for judgilent upon tile verdict nmu.st prepare it in suitable fiorm, andl serve it lnpon the adverse party within ten days after tile trial. (rlie 34, Sul)re)me Ct.) Tlie lines of the original verdict and of each copy thereof must correspond, and be consecultively numbiered. (lb.) Thle adverse party may, within teln lays after such service, serve a copy of lany aimenidmelnts which he may desire onl tie moving party, and tile latter may, withiln lour (lays thereafter, serve a lnotice upon ile for- rier appointiing . p llace and a time, not less than fiur nor more tlhan twenty days after such service, at which the proposed verdict and amendments will be submitted to the judgle who tried the cause, for settlement. (lb.) By failing to take any of these steps within the time speci- sied, tile liglht to do so is waived. (Rule 35, Suptremle C(t.) Before bringing the verdict on for settlement, the party,495 TRIAL BY JURY.
Special verdict Interpretation. Bringing on argument preparing it should mark, against each amendment pro. posed, his allowance or disallowance thereof. (Rule 36, Supremen Ct.,Perhaps the rule (No. 37) requiring cases to be filed within ten days after settlement, applies to special ver. dicts, but they are not expressly mentioned in that rule. They certainly are to be filed and entered on the minutes. (Code, Â§ 261.),Interpretation of verdict.]-A special verdict is con- strued in the light of the pleadings. It is not enough that it shows a good claim or defense; it must establish that claim or defense which is pleaded, in order to author- ize judgment.upon it. (M'Carty v. Hud7sons, 24 Wend. 291.) Irrelevant matter may be disregarded. (Richlond v. Talinadge, 16 Johns. 307.) For illustrations of the mode of interpreting a special verdict, see Wright v. Douglass (7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 564); Holmes v. Lansing (3 Johns. Cas. 73.),Stay of proceedings.]-We can see no necessity for ob- taining an order for a stay of proceedings, where a special verdict is rendered. Neither party can regularly enter judgment without an order of the court upon the verdict.,Bringing on argument.]-The verdict being settled, it is the duty of the plaintiff (Rule 42, Supreme Ct.), to bring on the cause for argument, though either party may do so, on serving the ordinary notice of motion for the first day of the term (id.); and in either case the plaintiff is bound to furnish the defendant, eight days before the argument, with a copy of the special verdict, and the court, upon opening the argument, with the same, and also with a copy of the pleadings. (Ib.) If the plaintiff neglects to furnish the necessary papers in due time, the defendant may move, on affidavit and notice, that the cause be struck from the calendar, and judgment be rendered in his favor. (lb.) 496
Special verdict. Argument. Verdict subject to opinion of court. A note of issue must be filed with the clerk, in like manner as when the cause is brought on for trial (See ante, p. 436.),Tlhe argumsenlt.]-The motion for judgment on the ver- dict is an enumerated one (Rule 40, Supreme Ct.), and is to be heard at special term (Code, Â§ 265), where it will be called in its order on the calendar. The party noticing the motion opens the argument;-if both have noticed it, the plaintiff would seem to have the right of opening.,The court has no power to look into the evidence to ascertain any fact. Judgment must be pronounced solely upon consideration of the special verdict. (Eisemann v. SSwan, 6 Bosw. 668; La Frombois v. Jackson [Ct. of Errors], 8 Cow. 589, 600; see Williams v. Jackson, 5 Johns. 502.) Proceedings after argument.]-An order should be en- tered in conformity with the decision of the court, whether it be for judgment or a new trial. If judgment is or- dered, it may be entered upon the order in the usual manner.,ART. 25.-Verdict subject to the opinion of the court. When, upon a trial, the case presents only questions of law, the judge may direct a verdict subject to the opinion of the court at general term. (Code, Â§ 265.),The court has no power to direct a verdict subject to a reference. The only tribunal to which a general verdict can be made subject, is the general term. (BucJaluna v. Clesebrough, 5 Duer, 238.) A verdict of this nature cannot be ordered in' any case in which a single question of fact is in dispute under the evidence (Gilbert v. Beach, 16 N. Y. 606; Cobb v. Cornish, id. 602; 6 Abb. 129; 15 How. 407; Chambers v. Grantzon, 7Bosw. 414; see Whitaker v. Merrill, 28 Barb. 526; Brower v. Orser, 2 Bosw. 365); nor if there are any exceptions to the admission of evidence (Purchase v. Mattison, 25 N.,63,497
Verdict subject to the opinion of the court. Form. Y. 211; 15 Abb. 402; Bell v. Shibley, 33 Barb. 610; Sackett v. Spencer, 29 id. 180; Haveneyer v. Cunningham, 8 Abb. 1; Bangs v. Palmer, 16 How. 542; Beebe v. Ayres, 28 Barb. 275; see Clark v. Dearborn, 6 Duer, 309), as these are not the "questions of law" intended by the Code. (Ib.) Such a verdict cannot, therefore, be ordered where the amount to be recovered by the plaintiff, in case of judgment in his favor, is left undetermined by the jury (Btclutirzan v. Cheesebroiugh, 5 Duer, 238), nor where, in an action for chattels, the plaintiff's damages for their de. tention are not assessed (Anon., gen. term, 1st dist., May, 1864), unless the plaintiff will consent to a verdict for nominal damages.,An error in this respect is not cured by the lack of any objection at the time. It is a mistake which cannot be overlooked at any stage of the action. (Purchase v. Mat- tUson, 25 N. Y. 211; 15 Abb. 402.),But it seems not to be necessary that the facts should be agreed upon by the parties. If the jury find the facts specially, that is regarded as sufficient. (See tPuris v. Coleman, 1 Bosw. 321; Whlittaker v. Meirrill, 28 Barb. 526; Clark v. Dearborn, 6 Duer, 309.),A verdict of this nature cannot be rendered by a judge trying a cause without a jury. (Malloy v. Wood, 3 Abb. 369; 14 How. 67.),Form.]-This verdict is in form simply the ordinary general verdict, with the addition of the proviso that it is subject to the opinion of the court at a general term.,It is quite immaterial for which party the verdict pur- ports to be, as it is a mere matter of form (see Cobb v. Cornish, 16 N. Y. 602), unless the case, as made up, should leave some issue of fact in doubt, in which event such issue will be deemed to have been decided in favor of the party for whom the verdict is recorded (Slarp v. Whippl 3 Bosw. 474; Williams v. Ins. Co. of 1V. A., 1 Hilt. 345), especially where such verdict is taken by consent, upon 498
Stay of proceedings. The decision. Objections and exceptions. an admission of the adverse party that there can be no dispute about the facts. (Sharp v. Whipple, supra.),Stay of proceedings.]-Without any formal order, the necessary effect of a verdict subject to the opinion of the court is to stay proceedings until the case can be heard at the general term, and no judgment can be entered meanwhile. (Roosa v. Snyder, sp. t., 12 How. 285; Jack- son v. Fitzsimmons, 6 Wend. 486.) Bringing on for argumant.]-It is the daty of the party in whose favor (nominally) the verdict is recorded, to pre- pare the papers, and move for judgment. (See Cobbi v. Cornish, 16 N. Y. 602.) For this purpose, he must prepare a case, in the man- ner, and subject to the rules, of a case made upon a motion for a new trial. It must be settled and filed in like manner, and printed in the mode required of papers on an appeal from a judgment. (Rule 46, Suplrene Ct.) As to the manner of preparing, settling, and filing the case, seepost., chap. xcvii. Til decision.]-Jtudgment may be rendered tor either party, without regard to whom it is nominally in favor of, as that is merely a matter of form. (Chlittedleit v. Emplire Stone Dressing Co., 6 Duer, 30.) Proceedings under thte decision.]-An order for judgment upon the verdict should be drawn up and entered with the clerk; and thereupon judgment may be regularly entered.,AnT. 26.-Objections and exceptions. Exception, wtiat.]-An exception is a formal objection to the decision of the court upon a question of law, dnd is so called, in order to distinguish it from a common objection, which is made for the purpose of raising a question for the court to decide upon the spot, rather than to procure a review of such decision.,499
Exceptions. What may be excepted to. What cannot be. What may be excepted to.]-Any decision of the court upon a matter of strict legal right may be excepted to.,Thus, an exception will lie where a challenge to a juror is improperly overruled (People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 281), or to an erroneous refusal to appoint triers (ib.; see Peo. ple v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 509); to the admission of im. proper and prejudicial evidence, or exclusion of competent evidence; to an erroneous charge, or refusal to charge in accordance with a proper request.,An expressed opinion of the judge upon a question of law, which may probably influence the verdict, is subject to exception, notwithstanding the judge states that he does not think the question arises in the case. (Willson v. Betts, 4 Denio, 201.),Wlut cannot be excepted to.]-Exceptions lie only to errors of the judge, and not to those of the jury. (See Stanley v. Webb, 21 Barb. 148; Foot v. Wiswall, 14 Johns. 304.) No exception can, therefore, be taken to a verdict (ib.), nor can any question as to the weight of evidence be raised by an exception. (People v. Rathbun, 21 AWend. 548; Willard v. Warren, 17 id. 257; People v. Haynes, 11 id. 557; Walker v. Penniman, 8 Gray, 233.),No exception will lie to any decision of the judge upon a matter discretionary with him. Error in the exercise of a discretionary power is to be corrected in another way. (People v. Cook, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 67; Garner v. Hannah, 6 Duer, 275; Chancel v. Barclay, 1 E. D. Smith, 384; Roth v. Schloss, 6 Barb. 308; People v. Finnegan, 1 Park. Cr. 147; see Hunt v. Hudson Riv. B. R. Co., 2 Duer, 481; Phincle v. auglhan, 12 Barb. 215.),No exception will lie to mere expressions of the judge's opinion' as to the effect or weight of the evidence (Dows v. Bush, 28 Barb. 157,180; Lansing v. Russell, 13 id. 510; Bruce v. Westervelt, 2 E. D. Smith, 440, 461; Bulkelme v. Keteltas, 4 Sands. 450; People v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 548; Whtiton v. Old Colony Ins. Co., 2 Mete. [Mass.] 1), nor to 500
Exceptions What cannot be excepted to. When to be taken. an opinion upon a hypothetical case, not supported nor pretended to be supported by the evidence on either side (see Lyon v. Marshall, 11 Barb. 241; Haydenl v. Palmer, 2 Hill, 206; MelUede v. Boston Iron Co., 5 Cush. 158), especially when an opinion upon the point is asked by the party seeking to except to it. (Walrod v. Bull, 9 Barb. 271.) If the judge led the jury to imagine that the evidence could possibly warrant the supposition that such hypothe- sis was involved in the issue, the case would of course be different. (Storey v. Brennan, 15 N. Y. 524.),When to be tal7en.]-An objection must be taken at the first opportunity, and an exception taken immedi- ately upon the objection being overruled. (Ward v. ]Vhitnet, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 452; 3 Sands. 399; McKnigqht v. Dunlop, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 537; see 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 720; [2 id. 492.) Thus, an objection to the admission of evidence must be raised at the moment when it is first offered (Ward v. Whitney, supra, Cheesebrougl v Taylor, 12 Abb. 227) or, if its incompetency does not appear when thus offered, as soon as the ground of objection becomes apparent. (Iledy v. Barnes, 4 Denio, 73; Mitchell v. Roulstone, 2 Hall, 351.) So an exception to the charge should be made imme- diately after its delivery (Caanden &c. R. R. Co. v. Bel- knap, 21 Wend. 354), and though such an exception may be made at any time before the verdict is actually de- livered (Lanuse v. Barker, 10 Johns. 312*), it cannot be made afterwards. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 720; [2 id. 422].) It is not necessary to renew an objection duly made to the admission of evidence upon thejudge's noticing such evidence in his charge. (People v. Holmes, 5 Wend. 191.) * See dictum to the oontrary, Life & Jre Ins. Co. v. Medanics' Fbe Ins. Co (7 Wend. 31).,501
Exceptions. By whom taken. Form.,-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ By whom.I]-An objection or exception must be taken only by the individual as to whom it is valid. An excep. tion taken jointly by two persons, as to one of whom it is not well taken, is unavailing to either. (Black v. Foster, 28 Barb. 387; 7 Abb. 406.),Foarm.]--Objections are verbally taken, but exceptions must be reduced to writing (3 R. S. (5t7 ed.) 720; [2 id. 422]), though the court may allow time to put them in proper form. (lb.),An objection or exception must be accompanied with a statement of the ground upon which it is made* (Â¥alton v. National &c. Lift Ins. Co., 20 N. Y. 32; Requa v. Hobles, 16 id. 193; llabbett v. White, 12 id. [2 Kern.] 442; Caynga Bank v. Warden, 6 id. [2 Seld.] 30; Coiuperthwaite v. Sheffield, 3 id. [3 Comst.] 243; Shotwell v. Mali, 38 Barb. 445, 469; Kiher v. IKinmbal, 10 Cal. 267; Castle v. Duryea, 32 Barb. 480; Norlman v. Wells, 17 Wend. 136; see Belknap v. Sealey, 14 N. Y. E4 Kern.] 143; Morris v. Husson, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 204; Pearson v. Fiske, 7 Abb. 419; 2 Hilt. 146; Wymlan v. Hart, 12 How. 122); and it can be sustained upon no other ground than that thus specified (Durgin v. Ireland, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 322; NAetton v. Harris, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 345; Harris v. Panama R. R. Co., 5 Bosw. 312; Eteell v. Dodge, 33 Barb. 336; Cary v. Clevelaned & Toledo R. R., 29 id. 35, 41; Mann v. Eckford, 15 Wend. 502), unless the ground of objection not stated is one that could not possibly be obviated (Merritt v. Seaman, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168; see Shotwell v. Mali, supra), or unless the ruling excepted to is of a very general nature, as for example, a direction to the jury to find for a particular party (Requa v. Holmes, 16 N. Y. 193; see Adaims v. Saratoga &c. R. R. Co., 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 328), in which case a general exception is sufficient. (Ib.t) * Rogers v. lFdtcher (13 Abb. 299), seems to us erroneous on this point. t Compare Lansing v. W'swal (5 Denio, 213). 502,TRIAL BY JURY.
Bsceptions. Must be specific. Exceptions ittust be specific.]-Exceptions should be confined to the precise points which are objectionable. A single exception to a whole charge, or paragraph of a charge, any portion of which is correct (Decker v. jMathews, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern. 313; Caldwell v. Murphy, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 416; Howland v. Willetts, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 170; Booth v. Sivezey, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 276; Acker v. Ledyard, id. 62; Hart v. Rensselaer &c. R. R. Co., id. 37; Hunt v. Msaybee, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 266; Haggart v. Morgan, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 422; Cronk v. Canfield, 31 Barb. 171; see Oldfield v. . Y. & Harlem R. B. Co., 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 310), or to an entire piece of evidence, any part of which is admissible (Day v. Both, 18 N. Y. 448; Requa v. Holmes, 16 N. Y. 193; Graham v. Dunigan, 2 Bosw. 516; Beebe v. Bull, 12 Wend. 504), or to a refusal to charge several propositions, any one of which was properly refused (iYoaces v. People, 25 N. Y. 380, 389; Keller v. VN. Y. Central R. R. [Ct. of Appeals], 24 How. 172; M'Carty v. Edwards, id. 236; M3agee v. Badger, 30 Barb. 246; People v. Horton, 4 Park. Cr. 222), is unavailing. Nor will such an exception be made good, by taking it "to each and every part" of the charge or ruling of the court. (Caldwell v. Murphy, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 416; Ackcer v. Iedyard, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 62; Jones v. Osgood, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 233; Murray v. Smith, 1 Duer, 412; Potter v. Seymour, 4 Bosw. 140; Nrevins v. Bay State Co., id. 225.) But where the charge or ruling consists of but a single proposition, a single exception is of course sufficient. (Requa v. Holmes, 16 N. Y. 193.) And an exception "to each part of the charge, separately and distinctly," has been treated, with hesitation, as sufficient (Dotes v. Rlush, 28 Barb. 181), though under circumstances which scarcely warrant the case to be regarded as a precedent on this point. An objection to a deposition "that the cross-interroga- tories are not all answered," does not raise the point that,503
the answers are not sufficiently specific. (M'Carty v. Edwards, 24 How. 236.),An exception " to that part of the decision which allows $3,342 as interest," raises no question as to the length of time for which interest should be allowed, and if any interest was due, the exception is wholly unavailable. (McMahon v. N. Y. & Erie R. R., 20 N. Y. 463.),If a charge is capable of two constructions, one of which would be in conformity with law, the exceptant must specify the modification which ought to have been made to relieve it from ambiguity. (Springsteed v. Lawson, 14 Abb. 328; 23 How. 302.),An offer of evidence must be made in such terms as to leave no room for doubt as to its competency under a proper definition of the law; and if not so made, an exception to its exclusion will not be available, unless it appears that the court understood the offer to be made on the ground which in law justified it. (Ct. of Appeals Keller v. N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co., 24 How. 172.),Exceptions, how cured.J]-An exception, valid when taken, may be obviated by subsequent events in the course of the trial.,Thus, an exception to the admission of incompetent evidence is cured by the subsequent proof of same fact on the part of the exceptant (Grimm v. Hamel, 2 Hilt 434); and, of course, by an express waiver on his part (Rjendell v. Butler, 10 Wend. 119), or by an express instruction from the court to the jury to disregard such evidence (People v. Parish, 4 Denio, 153; see Travis v. Barger, 24 Barb. 614), provided it clearly appears that the evidence has had no influence upon the verdict to the exceptant's prejudice, but not otherwise. (Erben v. Lorillard, 19 N. Y. 299.),The erroneous exclusion of evidence is cured by its subsequent admission at any stage of the trial (Stephes v. 504,TRIALI BY JURY.
Exceptions. How cured. Reservation for argument. People, 4 Park. Cr. 510;* Robinson v. Fitchburg &cc. R. R. Co., 7 Gray, 92; see Crounse v. Fitch, 14 Abb. 346; 23 How. 350; Morgan v. Reed, 7 Abb. 215; Hayden v. Palmer, 2 Hill, 209), especially if it is so admitted upon a renewed offer on the part of the exceptant. (Forrest v. Forrest, 6 Duer, 102.) An erroneous refusal to nonsuit a plaintiff is cured by the subsequent reception of evi- dence on either side establishing his right to recover. (Colegrore v. N. Y. & Harlem R. R. Co., 6 Duer, 382; asf'd, Schenectady &c. Plankroad Co. v. Thatcher, 20 N. Y. 492; 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.], 102, 112; M:Cotter v. Hooker, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 497; Haupt v. Poilnmtann, 16 Abb. 301; Kent v. Harcourt, 33 Barb. 491; Westlake v. St. Lawrence Ins. Co., 14 id. 206; Hyland v. Sherunn, 2 13. D. Smith, 234.) Bill of exceptions.]-For directions as to the form, con- tents, and preparation of bills of exceptions, see post, chap. xcvii.,ART. 27.-Reservation of the cause for judgment. The judge before whom the action is tried may, after the verdict is rendered, direct the cause to be reserved for argument or further consideration (Code, Â§ 264); and though this is a matter in his discretion, when all the issues are submitted to the jury for a general verdict, it is clearly his duty to do so where only some specified questions of fact are decided by the jury. It is, however, usual to provide for the disposition of the cause in the order directing the trial of such questions; thus relieving the judge at the circuit from any control of the matter. Reservation for argumnent.]-When difficult questions have arisen at the trial, or when there is doubt as to the proper form of judgment to be entered on the verdict, it,*See 8. C. on Appeal, 19 N. Y. 571. 64,505
Reservation for argument. Reservation for general term. may be convenient to reserve the cause for argument on those points. The practice is, however, but little used, there being other means of correcting errors more expe. ditious and satisfactory.,The rules of 1849 (Rule 30), required causes thus re- served to be argued at special term. But the new rules (No. 40) make no mention of this class of cases, unless a ' case " is prepared for the argument, in which event the cause must go to the special term. Otherwise, we think the judge may direct the cause to be argued before liul at the circuit. If he cannot hear it there, it must clearly go over to the special term (Code, Â§ 265), and a case must be prepared and settled in the usual manner. (See post, chap. xcvii.),Reservation of exceptionls.--Thle judge may order the exceptions taken in the course of the trial to be heard in the first instance at a general term, and that judgment be meanwhile suspended. (Code, Â§ 265.),He cannot, however, order the whole case to be heard at a general term, but only the exceptions. (Cronk v. Can. field, 31 Barb. 171.) Whether this proceeding is allowable, where the only exception in the case is to the dismissal of the complaint, must be considered doubtful. In Hoagland v. Miller (16 Abb. 103), it was held that it is not. In La7le v. Artisans' Bank (17 Abb. 232), it was held that it is. There is no satisfactory statement of the reasons for either decision.,Upon such exceptions coming on to be heard, no ques tions of fact, or the weight of evidence (HotcEitdis v. Hodge, 38 Barb. 117), such as the excessiveness of dama- ges (Crouch v. Parker, 40 Barb. 94), can be reviewed.,Reservation for consideratio.l.]-The judge has power to reserve the cause for consideration, without hearing further argument (Code, Â§ 264), and after such considera 506,TRIAL BY JURY.

The unsuccessful party, if he proposes to move for a new trial, will d) well to apply to the court on the spot, as soon as the verdict is delivered, for such time as he may require to make a case or exceptions and for a stay of proceedings, until the decision thereon. This the court has power to grant (Livingston v. Miller, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 117), and usually does grant, where it appears probable that it is asked in good faith. By thus applying to the judge in court, the limitations of Â§ 401 of the Code are avoided. An order extending the time to serve a case or excep- tions does not operate of itself as a stay of proceedings. (Goodrich v. Downs, 5 Hill, 510.) Neither does the service of a case or exceptions so operate. (Oakley v. Aspinwall, 1 Sands. 694.),CHAPTER XCIV. TRIAL OF ISSUES OF FACT BY THE COURT.* ARTICLE 1. General incidents of the trial.,2.

General incidents of the trial. When causa must be sent to jury ble to a trial by the court, and need not therefore be re. peated here. Those articles cover the entire proceedings from the notice of trial to the submission of the cause for judgment, except such topics as are discussed in the subsequent part of this chapter.,The right to begin, which is treated of in art. 14 of the last chapter (ante, p. .167) is regarded as a matter of small importance in a trial by tile court. No appel. late tribunal would interfere with the decision of the judge who tried.the cause on that ground.,If either party desires to have a fact found which is not directly put in issue by the pleadings, he must, before the close of the trial, request the judge to pass upon it. (leroy v. Kerr, 21 How. 409.),When cause must be sent to jiury.]-An action in which equitable relief is demanded by the complaint, and in which the facts proved would justify the court in granting such relief, is triable by the court, notwithstanding that the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, deems it unnecessary to award any other relief than pecuniary damages. (Dunnell v. Keteltas, 16 Abb. 205.) But if, upon the facts proved to exist at the commencement of the action, the court has no power to award any special or equitable relief, the defendant has a right to insist upon a trial by jury (Stevenson v. Buxton, 37 Barb. 13; 15 Abb. 352; Lewis v. Varnulm, 12 Abb. 305), and the cause should be sent to the jury side of the court for trial. (Stevenson v. Bluxton, supra.),This, however, is not necessary, unless demanded by the defendant before the cause is submitted for decision (Greason v. eteltas, 17 N. Y. 491), and as soon as the ground of the demand becomes apparent. And it is neither necessary nor proper to dismiss the complaint in any such case on account of the action being brought to trial without a jury. (N. Y. Ice Co. v. Northwestern Ins.
Decision of the court. When decision to be rendered. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296; Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y. 40.*),ART. 2.-Decision of the court. The cause having been fully tried, and submitted to the court, the judge must decide it himself. He cannot, after such submission, order a reference to decide any of the issues. (O'Briein v. Bowers, 4 Bosw. 657; 10 Abb. 106.) Neither can any other judge interfere in the decision of the cause (Clhamberlain v. Depsey, 14 Abb. 241), even to order a reference to take an accounting (ib.), though this might very properly be (lone by the judge who tried the cause. (Code, Â§ 271.),What must be decided.]-Tlle whole of the issues in the action must be decided. The same principles govern in this respect as in the case of a verdict, and it any mate- rial issue is overlooked in the decision, it will be a mistrial. (See Clamberlain v. Dempsey, 14 Abb. 241; Griffin v. Cranston, 5 Bosw. 658; Butrger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11.) Decision absolute.]-The judge has no power to render a decision subject to the opinion of the general term. That mode of proceeding is confined to jury trials. (Mal- o0y v. Wood, 3 Abb. 369; 14 How. 67.) Neither has he nor any other judge power to stay the entry of judgment upon his decision. (Wright v. Delafield, sp. t., 11 How. 465.),Wlten decision to be rendered.]-The decision must be made within twenty days after the court at which the trial took place (Code, Â§ 267), and uo doubt a nandamus would lie to compel a decision at the expiration of that time, unless the judge needed further time to consider. (People v. Dodge, sp. t., 5 How. 47.) But a decision ren- * The decisions at special term in Stevenson v. Buxton (15 Abb. 352), and the cases in the note thereto, were clearly erroneous. An appeal is pending in that case.
The decision. When to be rendered. Form and settlement. dered after that period is perfectly valid, the provision of the Code as to time being directory merely. (Stewart v. Slater, 6 Duer, 83, 102; Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; People v. Dodge, supra.),The decision must be rendered before the judge's term of office expires. If no decision is rendered before that time, the whole trial falls through. (Putnam v. Crombie, 34 Barb. 232.),Form of decision.]--The decision must be made in writing (Code, Â§ 267), an oral direction to enter judgment being insufficient (see Sands v. Church, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 347; Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; Russell v. Arrui dor, 2 Cal. 305), and it must declare what judgment is to be entered. A mere opinion is not sufficient for the pur- pose (Mills v. Thutrsby [Ct. of Appeals], 12 How. 417; Thomas v. Tanner, sp. t., 14 id. 426; see Magie v. Baker, 14 N. Y. 435.),The decision must contain a statement of the facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately (Code, Â§ 267),* and if it contains no such statement, it is irregular. (See Chutrch v. Erbeln, 4 Sands. 691; Ifulce v. Sherman, 13 HIow. 411; Peck v. Yorks, sp. t., 14 id. 416; Snook v. Fries, 19 Barb. 313; De)minig v. Post, sp. t., i Code Rep. 121; Doke v.

Where this course is pursued, the successful party should prepare a draft of the decision, and submit it to his opponent. If they cannot agree upon it, it may be settled by the judge, upon notice to the adverse party, of two days. Such at least is the usual practice. Filing decision.j-The decision ought to be filed with the clerk, within twenty days after the court (Code, Â§ 267), which means, we presume, after the adjournment of the court for the term. Remedies against defects in the decision.]-The omission of any finding of facts is an irregularity, to be corrected by motion to set aside the decision or judgment (Ifikce v. Shenrma, 13 How. 411.; Chtrch v. Erben, 4 Sands. 691; see Heroy v. Kerr, 21 How. 409, 423), and not by excep- tion and appeal (ib.);* and the want of any written deci- sion is remediable in like manner by setting aside the judgment. (Thomas v. Tanner, sp. t., 14 How. 426; Blur- ger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11.) Where a written decision is made, which omits to find on a part of the issues, the remedy is by motion to return the decision to the judge for amendment in that respect (People v. Abright, 14 Abb. 305; Slajrp) v. Wright, 35 Barb. 236; see Heroy v. Kerr, 21 How. 409; Peck v. Yorls, sp. t., 14 id. 416; lttlce v. Shernan, 13 id. 411), unless that is mpracticable, in which case the decision should be set a.side. (Peck v. Yorks, supra.) A general exception to the decision, without showing an express request to pass upon such issues, and a refusal to do so, will not raise the objection for review on appeal. (Grant v. Morse, 22 N. Y. 323; Heroy v. Kerr, 21 How. 409.) *The contrary rule is established in Missouri (Ragan v. Al'Coy, 26 Mo. 166), and in California (Russell v. Armador, 2 Cal. 305).
Reservation of cause for judgment. ART. 3.-Reservation of cause for judgment. Although the court has no power, after having renlered a final decision, to suspend the entry of judgment (Malloy v. Wood, 3 Abb. 369; 14 How. 67 ; Wright v. Delafidd, sp. t., 11 How. 465), it has power to reserve the decision itself until such proceedings are had as may be necessar for a final determination of the controversy.,Thus, it is frequently tlhe case that long accounts are necessary to be taken in order to ascertain how much a plaintiff ought to recover, and yet it would be unwise to attempt to take such accounts until it is first decided whether the plaintiff is to recover at all or not, since, if the main question is decided against him, the time so spent would be needlessly lost, while if it is decided in his favor, the accounts can be taken in as little time after the decision as they could have been before. So there may be other questions of fact important to be decided in case of a judgment in favor of one party, but quite irrelevant in case of a contrary decision. Such quostions may be sent to a referee for determination (Code, Â§ 271), and the final decision on those points reserved, though the general issues in the action are decided. It does not seem to be necessary that any formal written decision should be filed until the referee's report upon such questions comes in, but it is clearly for the interest of both parties to have such a decision on record, as without it, tlle jdge's memory might mislead him, and the final decision become a different thing from what it would have been, had it been made out while his recollection was fresh. M3ore over, he might die pending the reference, and the whole proceedings fall through, whereas, if lie had passed in writing upon all the issues not referred, the successfl party would have no difficulty in obtaining judgment.
Objections and exceptions. When and how taken.,ART. 4.-Objections and exceptions. Exceptions in trials by the court are governed by the same rules as in trials by jury, as to which, see ante, pp. 499-505. The Code (Â§ 268) allows either party to except to a de- cision on a matter of law arising upon a trial by the court within tell days after written notice of the judgment; but this only applies to decisions to which there was no opportunity to except luring the course of the trial. (Htnt v. Bloomer, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 341; 12 Ilow. 567; see Jo7hson. v. Wn7dtlock, 13 N. Y. 344; 12 How. 571; Bell;kal v. Sealey, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 143; Tremiain v. Riler, 13 How. 148.) Decisions made during the progress of the trial must be excepted to on the spot; rulings contained only in the written decision may be excepted to within the ten days. (Ib.) If testimony is received subject to objection, without any positive decision upon its admissibility, and is taken into consideration in the decision, that is, in effect, a ruling after the trial that the evidence is admissible, and may thereforebeb excepted to within the ten days. (Dean v. loesler, 1 Hilt. 420.) Tlhe decision of the judge upon questions of fact, can- not be excepted to, any more than tile verdict of a jury. (Tremtain v. Rider, 13 Ilow. 148; see Maagie v. Baker, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 438.) If the judge makes only one decision on a point of law, a general exception is sufficient (Pratt v. Foote, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 4i3; 10 id. 59!), and so if all his rulings are wrong (see lMaqie v. Baker, 14 N. Y. R[ Kern.] 435), but not otherwise. (See ante, p. 503.) A general exception to the decision will not suffice to rRise the objection that no (written decision was rendered (Sands v. Chturch, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 347), or that the judge has omitted to pass upon a material question of fact. (Grant v. Morse, 22 N. Y. 323; IeCoy v. K'err, 21 How. 409.),65
TRIAL OF ISSUES OF LAW. How tried. The decision,CHAPTER XCV. TRIAL OF ISSUES OF LAW. All issue of law is always tried by the court, at special term, if ally is held in the county, and if none is so held, then at circuit (Code, Â§ 253); unless referred by consent of tlh parties. (Code, Â§ 253, 270.),It has been said (Ward v. Davis, sp. t., 6 How. 274), that an issue of law may be tried il any county within the judicial district which includes the county namled in the complaint. But the case is not entitled to the force of a positive decision, inasmuch as it was not argued, and went off upon another point; and the language of the Code is explicitly exposed to this dictum. (See also 1 Monell Pr. 700.),'The mode of noticing the cause for trial, placing it on the calendar, &c., is substantially the same as upon a trial by jury, and arts. 2, 3, and 9, of chap. xciii. (aote, pp. 432-439, 451-457), are, in general, applicable to the trial of an issue of law. Judgment may be taken by default, as upon the trial of an issue of fact (see lante, p, 450), without further p)roof on either side than of the due ser- vice of notice of trial.,The party demurring brings on the argument. He must furnish the court with a fair copy of the pleadings, alnd both the court and his opponent with a copy each, of his points, if lie has any in writing. i'lie. adverse party replies, and the demurrant closes the argument. The court will not usually hear more than one counsel on each side, and for one hour each. (Ride 54, Sutl)remle Ct.) The demurrant should not therefore occupy more tlan half an hour in opening, in order to lhave as much time in closing.,The decision.]-Tlhe decision of the court must be made in writing, stating the conclusions of law, and must befiled

(Code, Â§ 267.)* As to the mode of enforcing this provision of the Code, see ante, p. 509. The remarks there made are, to a great extent, applicable to this case. Leave to atlenid.]-It is, we believe, an almost invaria- ble practice, upon allowing a demurrer, to grant leave to the pleader to amend upon terms; and it is usual, upon overrulilg a demurrer, to allow the demurrant to plead over on terns, unless there is reason to suspect him of bad faith. (See Code, Â§ 172.) This subject is, however, more fully discussed in chap. cxxxii., ilfra. Subsequent proeedings.]-Uniiless such amendment as the decision may allow is made within the time it pre- scribes, the successful party may, provided there is no issue of fact to be tried, enter judgment accordingly. (Code, Â§ 267.) For the mode of entering judgment in such cases, see post, chap. cx. If leave is granted to amend or plead over, it will be for the advantage of the defeated party to procure an order to be entered, directing judgmenl t against him unless he so amends or pleads; for then lie can appeal from the order, whereas otherwise he could appeal only from the judglmenlt. No exceptions are necessary or proper upon the trial of an issue of. law.,*As amcnded, 1860.,515

Proceedings on interlocutory reference. 12. The report. 13. Exceptions. 14. Proceedings on the report. 15. Reviewing report. 16. Changing referees. ART. 1.-Nature of the proceeding. A reference is a substitute for trial in open court. One or more persons are appointed by the court to determine questions in litigation between the parties, and to report their conclusions to the court. If all the issues raised by the pleadings are referred, the proceeding is usually called a "reference of all the issues." If only a part of the issues or questions of fact not arising under the pleadings are referred, it is called an " interlocutory reference.",In either of these proceedings, the reference is a matter under the control of the court; but when a reference is made by consent, a very slight change in the wording of such consent may transform it into an arbitration which the court cannot review nor control. (See Bltiut v. IVdi- ney, 3 Sands. 4.),The provision of the state constitution, securing the right of trial by jury as it theretofore existed, does not interfere with the power of the courts to order a reference,
_- that power having been exercised prior to the adoption of the constitution, either of 1846 or 1821. (Lee v. TiUot- son, 24 Wend. 337.),AnT. 2.-Referekwe by consent. All or any of the issues in an action, whether of fact or of law, may be referred upon the written consent of the parties. (Code, Â§ 270.) Though in strictness the consent of the parties should be reduced to writing and signed by them or their attor- neys, yet if they consent in open court, and an order is thereupon entered by the clerk (People v. 2SGinnis, 1 Park. Cr. 387; see Keator v. Ulster &c. Plankcroad Co., sp. t., 7 low. 41; Bloore v Potter, 9 Wrend. 480), or if they appear before the referee and allow hiin. to enter their consent on the minutes (Leaycroft v. Fowler, sp. t., 7 How. 259), that is a sufficient writing of the consent. We are also decidedly of opinion that by appearing before the referee without objection on that ground, the want of a written consent, or indeed of any consent, is waived (see elnoulil v. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125; Greason v. Keteltas, 17 N. Y. 491; Andrews v. Elliot, 5 Ell. & Bl. 502), although the only positive decision on the subject is to the contrary. (Diddell v. Diddell, sp. t., 3 Abb. 167.) Where a referee is appointed by consent to take an account, the objection that no decree for an accounting has been made is waived. (Ludington v. Taft, 10 Barb. 447.) Actions for divorce.]-Actions for divorce are referable by consent (People v. M'Ginnis, 1 Park. Cr. 387; Anon., sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 139), and are now constantly so referred, notwithstanding the courts at first refused to do so. (See Whale v. Whale, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 115.) But the court will not order a.reference of such an action simply to take testimony. (Whale v. Whale, supra.),517 REFERENCE.
ART. 3.-Compulsory reference. .In what cases.l-The court nay, without the consent of parties, upon the application of either, or of its own motion, except where the investigation will require the decision of difficult questions of law, direct a reference in the following cases:,1. Where the trial of an issue of fact requires the exami- nation of a long account on either side; in which case the referees may be directed to hear and decide the whole issue, or to report upon any specific question of fact in- volved therein; or,,2. Whlere the taking of an account is necessary for the information of the court before judgmient, or for carrying a judgment or order into etlect; or,,3. Where a question of fact, other than upon the plead- ings, arises npon motion or otherwise in any stage of the action. (Code, Â§ 271.),On an application to the court for judgment upon fail- lre to answer, a reference may be ordered to take any proof required in an action for special relief or involving the examination of a long account. (Code, Â§ 246.),If judgment is given for the defendant upon an issue of law, and the taking of an account or the proofs of any fact is necessary to enable the court to complete the judg- ment, a reference or assessment by jury may be ordered as provided in Â§ 24( of the Code. (Code, Â§ 269.),A reference may be ordered to ascertain the damages sustained by a party against whom an injunction has been unjustly issued. (Code, Â§ 222.),Where any party intends to make or oppose a motion in any court of record, and it is necessary for him to have the affidavit of any person who has refused to make the same, such court may, by order, appoint a referee to take the affidavit or deposition of such person. Such person may be subpoenaed and compelled to attend and make an 518,REFERENCE.
affidavit before such referee, the same as before a referee to whom an issue is referred for trial. (Code, Â§ 401.) Whether tile court has a general power to order a refer- ence in actions not triable by jury, independent of the provisions of Â§9 270 and 271, is an important and unset- tled question. We understand that all the judges in the 8th judicial district hold that they have such power, and exercise it, partly under Â§ 254 of the Code, and partly under a supposed inherent authority of the court. In Einore v. Theomas (sp. t., 7 Abb. 70), a similar view is taken by POTTER, J., but in Draper v. Day (sp. t., 11 low. 439), it is held that the court lhas no such power. (Com- pare l1PMa7hon v. Allen, sp. t., 10 How. 384.) Reference to try issues.]-A reference to try the issues raised by the pleadings can be ordered only when the court can see that the trial must necessarily involve the examination of a long account (Freeman v. Allantic lMut. Ins. Co., 13 Abb. 124; Keeler v. Pollghkcepsic &c. Plankiroad Co., sp. t., 10 How. 11; Draper v. Day, sp. t., 11 id. 439; Graham v. Gouldi)g, sp. t., 7 id. 260), or when at least one of the issues involves such an account (h7iit- taker v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678). unless the court has tlat general inherent power to refer actions for special relief, of which we have before spoken. A reference to try the issues cannot be ordered merely upon the ground that, if the plaintiff recovers ju(ldgment, the examination of such an account will become neces- sary (Gaeroeon v. 2Freeman. sp. t., 10 Abb. 333; 18 How. 310; Keeler v. Potgh7tce2lsic &'c. P. iR. Co.; Grahamn v. Golding, supra; Slieldon vr' Weeks, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 57); though such account may be taken, if it seems advisable, by a referee, before the main issues are tried by a jury, reserving those issues forsuch trial. (Botwman v. Sheldon, 1 Duer, 607; Lewis v. Irving Fire Ins. Co., sp. t., 15 Abb. 303 n.) Where the right of either party to recover at all depends,519 REFERENCE.
upon the result of a long account, a reference, either of the whole (Mills v. T'huors)y, No. 1, sp. t., 11 How. 113), or part of the issues (Smith v. Dodd, 3 E. D. Smith, 348), is entirely proper.,What is a long acccunt.]--A account is, properly spealing, a statement of commercial or pecuniary trans. actions between two or more parties, occurring at various times. (See Freeman v. Atlantic Mhit. Ins. Co., 13 Abb. 124.),A bill of fifty different articles delivered at one time is not anl account at all (Swirft v. Wells, sp. t., 2 How. 79; see Slew art v. Elwel, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 139), and neither is a single bill of lading, containing a number of itels. (Miller v. IHoo7er, sp. t., 2 How. 171.) Nor do numerous items of damage (Dewey v. Field, sp. t., 13 How. 437; rl'Cielloi gh v. Brodic, sp. t., id. 346; see Shalo v. Miayor ofN. Y., sp. t., 9 Abb. 426; 18 How. 213), or of articles lost, in an action upon an insurance policy (Freean v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., 13 Abb. 124),* or a claim for numerous articles under a single obligation (Van Rensse- laer v. Jewett, 6 Hill, 373), constitute an account.,Not only must there be an account, but it nlust be a long one. (Parker v. Snell, 10 Wend. 577.) Four items do not constitute such an account (ib.), nor yet seven items, where all the transactions occurred on one or two days. (Harris v. _Mead, 16 Abb. 257 ; Smith v. Brown, sp. t., 3 How. 9.),Torts.]-An action of tort (e. g., upon a fraud), is refer- able under the Code, equally with an action on contract. (Shc7ldon v. Wood, 3 Sands. 739; Code Rep. N. S. 118; Atocha v. Garcia, sp. t., 15 Abb. 303; 24 How. 186.t),* To the contrary, see Lewis v. Irving Fire Ins. Co. (sp. t., 15 Abb. 303). i To the contrary are Dewey v. Field (sp. t., 13 How. 437); Sharp v. Mayor of N. Y: (sp. t., 9 Abb. 426); Freeman v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. (13 Ahb. 124). 520,REFERENCE.
Such an action, however, but rarely involves the exami- nation of a long account, and of course is not referable unless it does.,Questions ofla7w.]-A reference cannot be enforced where difficult questions of law are involved. (Code, Â§ 271.),For examples of such cases, see Ives v. Yandewater, (sp. t., 1 How. 168); Adams v. Bayles (2 Johns. 374); Low v. IIallett (3 Cai. 82); Codwtise v. Hacker (2 id. 251); Shaw v. Ayrs (4 Cow. 52.) The court must be satisfied that the questions involved are really diflicult. (inlon., 5 Cow. 423.),To e.amine title.]-Refercnces are frequently ordered for the purpose of examining into a title, as for example, in an action for specific performance, or on a motion to compel a purchase under a decree to complete his pur- chase. Such a reference will not, however, be ordered before judgment, if any other question than that of title is in dispute (Bll7th v. Elimhirst, 1 Ves. & B. 1; >Paton, v. Rogers, id. 351; lMorgan, v. Shawl , 2 MIeriv. 138; Port)man v. Mill, 2 Russ. 570; Gordon v. Ball, 1 Sim. & Stu. 178), unless all other questions raised are palpably frivolous. (W ood v. Machl, 5 Hare, 158; Boyes v. Liddell, 1 You. & Coll. Ch. 133; Boehmn v. WIood, 1 Jac. & W. 419; Withy v. Cottle, Turn. & Russ. 78.),To inrestsiyate attorney's lien.]-On an application for the protection of an attorney's lien, the court has power to refer the question without the consent of the parties. (A7;cerman v. Ackedwrman, 14 Abb. 229; but compare Fox v. Fox, sp. t., 24 How. 409.),ART. 4.-Motion for reference. Though the court may (Code, Â§ 271), and sometimes will refer a cause of its own motion (see for example, Van Zant v. Cobb, sp. t., 10 How. 348; Barron v. Sanford, sp. t., 6 Abb. 320 n.; 14 How. 443), yet, in general, such order is made upon the application of some of the parties.,66,521 REFERENCE.
When to move.]--A motion to refer the issues must not be made until issue is fully joilned between all the parties whose time to plead lhas not expired (.TJnsen v. Ta'nllen, 3 Cow. 34; Ditcher v. Wiiluts, sp. t., 2 How. 180), nor while an issue of law remains undecided which, if decided in a particular way, would disl)ose of all the issues of fact. (.TJansen v. Tappjnl, 3 Cow. 339.) In short, a lmotion to refer all or 'any of the issues raisedl by the pleadings ought not to be made until the cause is ready for trial.,It mlay be lmadel immnediately uponl joillder of issue, without waiting for a possible amenlldment of course y1 the adverse plarty (nlos v. Thomas, sp. t., 4 IIow. 290); although i' su(ch amlendmell nt is afterwards nmade, either party is entitled to have the order of reference revoked (see Beardtlshiy v. Sltorr, sp. t., 7 IIow. 2!)4), or more pro- perly, we think, to have it reconsidered as a new lquestion, for it woull seem useless to revoke it if the facts showed that it shoulld illmnediaItely be reinstated. It oughlt to be made before notice of trial has been given on either side, for if granted( after that, it will be onlyl upon payment of such costs as the adver.se party may have(l sustained in prelparing for trial. (Fish. v. Wright, 5 Cow. 2(!).) D)oubt- less, however, only such costs will be allowed as have been incurred in good faith, since one party iighilt hastily notice the cause for trial, in anticipation of a motion for referelce.,Affidavit on mnotion.]-The motion must be made upon an affidavit showing that issue is joined (Jansen v. T'ap- pen, 3 Cow. 34), in law as well as fact. (Daticher v. IVi1gus, sp. t., 2 How. 180.) But it is not necessary that it should state the place of trial (Feeter v. Jlarter, 7 Cow. 478; Cleveliand v. Strong, 2 id. 448), or allege that no difficult questions of law are involved. (Barber v. Cromwell, sp. t., 10 How. 351.),This affidavit must be made by the party himself, or must state a sifficient excuse for his not doing so. (Wood 522,REFERENCE.

Smnith, sp. t., id. 7.),Notice of 1notion1.]-In general, a notice of the motion is necessary, as upon other motions; but the court may, for its own convenience, order a reference on the hearing without any formal motion or previous notice. (Kelly v. Searing, sp. t., 4 Abb. 354.),It was formerly a rule that the notice of a motion for reference must name referees (Litsher v. WIaltlmo,, 1 Cai. 149; Bedle v. Wlillett, id. 7), but this rule is obsolete; and indeed in the first district, the judges of the Supreme Court made a rule forbidding any referee to be named without the consent of all parties in writing (13 How. 34(); a harsh rule, not now, we believe, enforced; though it is of little use to name a referee in that district, as the judges prefer to make their own choice.,Â§ 284.

Pield, sp. t., 13 How. 437; Salisbunry v. Scott, 6 Johns. 329;* Lusher v. Walton, 1 Cai. 149), for the burden of proof lies upon the opponent of the motion to show that such ques- tions will arise.

an accounting, an averment in the answer that the ac- counts had been adjusted at a certain time, and that the parties had "not taken any new contracts since," was held inot enough, even if conceded to be true, to prevent a reference. The plaintiff was, nevertheless, entitled to an accounting from the time at which such adjustment was had. (Kennedy v. S7tilton, 1 Hilt. 546; 9 Abb. 157 n.),It is not a sufficient objection to a motion for reference to show that the action was on a previous trial left to a jury. (Brown v. Bradshclw, 1 Duer, 635; 8 Iow. 176.),The opposing party may offer to admit upon the trial the items of the account, and upon such a stipulation being given, the motion will be denied. (liMullin v. Ielly, sp. t., 3 How. 12.),ART. 5.-Thic order of reference. Necessity of or(ler.]-Regularly, there should always be an order of reference entered, even when the reference is made by consent.

Biurwell, sp. t., 5 How. 341.) But in other cases, the absence of an order is waived by appearing before the referee in pursuance of the stipu- lation. (Whalen, v. Supervisors of Albany, 6 How. 278.) Where, however, the consent given is not in writing, we are disposed to think that the double omission of a written consent, and an order of the court, cannot be waived by ap)pearance. (See Andrelws v. Elliot, 5 Ell. & Bl. 502.),If no order is entered, it has been held that witnesses attending at the reference cannot be punished for false swearing (Bonner v. IcPltail, 31 Barb. 106), nor, we pre- sume, can their attendance be compelled.,Order upon consent.]-An order entered upon a stipula- tion is void if it does not conform thereto. (Haner v.

(Bennet v. Rees, 1 Keen, 405; Adonl., 3 Madd. 495; Hyde v. rrol.oiigton, id. 279; Jeinggs v. Hopton, 1 id. 211;* see Birch, v. Irtyl,(s, 2 3Mcriv. 444.) And after some conflict of decisions, it appears to be set- tled that such a clause may be inserte(l as a matter of course, unless specially refused by the court (Belnett v. lees, supra); and if not so inserted, the court will not, except in a very special case, order a new reference upon that point. (1ydie v. WVt')ltghtont, supra.),ART. 6.--The referees. Who slhould be (tl)pointtced.]-As a general rule, referees, are appointed from among the counselors or clerks of the court. But when facts are at issue which require the judgment of an expert, one of the referees ought to be selected from that class. Thus, in an action invxlvitng *Overruling Gibson v.

The referees HIow many. llow selected. questions of mechanical science, tle appointment of a practical engineer or millwright was advised (Omsted v. Loomis, 9 X. Y.

Ch. 220.),No jd(lge can act as referee in any case pending in his court, unless appointed as such before May, 1862. (Code, 2Â§ 273.)* Referees must reside in tile county in whicll the trial wouldl be had, if' the cause was tried by tle court. (ChluJLb v. Bernr, 7 Wend. 483; ,S1'erwJood v.

527 Powers and duties of referees. Adljolrlinmelt. AmolndImenlt.,ART. 7.-Powers and duties of refer'es. Administration of oaths.]-iAnyv referee may administer oaths in a proeeeding before hlimn (Code, Â§ 421), and this altlloui.l several referees are al)l)ointe( in such l)rocee(ling. (3 .1.S. (5th ed.) (;67; [2 id. 384].),The referee must himself swear all witnesses whose evidence is received by hliin (Sccurity Fire Ins. Co. v. Martin, sp. t., 15 A1b). 479), exce)t, of comuse, where the deposition of a witness is takell on ( colilissionI, or con- ditionally, & e. lie lias lno right to receive a comnlillo affidavit, sworn before a commissioner of deeds, as evi- dence for any purl)ose. (Ib.),Ad(journlment.]--Referees have tie same power to grant ad(iourllullll'ts, upoll or without terms, as the court itself. (Code, Â§ 272, 421.) Not only may they adjourn a hearing, but they na11': also, ill the exerciSe of a careful (liscrletiOln, postpone a sa;ie (see Kelly v. Israed, 11 1'aige, 147), but they have no right to postl)one action indefinitely (ib.), and in case of all unreasonalle 11and oplpressive l)ostlponemlent, the court will interfere, and require the referee to proceed. (Forrest v. Forrest, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 65.I).),The Revised Statutes (2 Ir. S. 384), authorized no a(ljolurlmnlent beyond the term of tile court, but the Code seems to remove this limitation. Amendmlent.]--teferees appointed to try a cause hl've tile same power to allow aelllell(lellts to tile pleadings and( sumlmIons, up1on or without terms, as tlhe court has upon a like trial. (Code, Â§ 272.)*,Whether or not they hav1e power to allow a new cause of action or defense to be set ull by way of amen(dment is as yet unsettled. The latest decision lho(ls that they have (VFanb Ness v. Bush7, 14 Abb. 33; 22 How. 481), but *As amended, 1859; superseding Billings v. Baker (sp. t., C Abb. 213).
other cases, of much weight, that they have not. (Unlion Bank v. MIott, sp. t., 10 Abb. 372; 18 How. 506; see TVooldrff v. Jtlrson, 32 Barb. 557; Ecerett v. Fendreyes, 19 N. Y. 539.) We are disposed to think that they have this power, but as the question turns simply upon the power of a judge at trial, and is not peculiar to references, we refer to chap. cxP., infra.,Punislhmenlt of contejmp)ts.]-Referees on a trial have like power witl the court to preserve order and punish viola- tions thereof; to conlpel the attendance of witnesses by attachment, and to punish theml as for a contempt for their non-attendance or refusal to testify. (Code, Â§ 272.);,We presume that referees appointed simply to take evidence and report the facts found are not invested with these powers, nor with the power of amendment above mentioned. Unless all the issues of fact are referred to them for decision, the proceeding is not properly a trial.,Discovery of books &(.]-A referee has no power to order a discovery or inspection of books or papers, whether under the Code or thle Revised Statutes, without a special authority from the court (Frascr v. Phelps, 3 Sandlf. 741), but such power may be conferred upon him by order of the court. (S. C., 4 Sands. G82.),When such power has been conferred, the court will leave it to the discretion of the referee to require the actual deposit of documents, or to be content with an opportu- nity for their inspection. (Henna v. Dunn, 6 Madd. 340.),Acting by depul)ty.]-A referee cannot delegate his autlo- rity. He cannot try a cause by deputy (Shitz1 v. 'Whit- ney, sp. t., 9 Abb. 71; 17 How. 471), nor when appointed to make a sale, can lie empower another person to per- form the duty. (Hceyer v. Deaves, 2 Johns. Ch. 1 5,.),* As amended, 1857; superseding Bonesteel v. Lynde (sp. t., 8 How. 22G). 528,REFERENCE.
Of course he may employ another person to perform a mere mechanical operation, as to write out his report, take notes of testimony in his presence, &c., and may employ an auctioneer or agent to effect a sale, reserving to himself the exercise of a suitable discretion. Powers on trial.]-For some account of the powers of referees in the ordinary course of a frial before them, see post, art. 10.,Duties of referees.]-Referees must keep as free fron. outside influence, or the influence of the parties, as jurors. (Dol7on v. Lewis, sp. t., 9 How. 1; Yale v. Gwinits, sp. t., 4 id. 253.) No referee can be a witness in any proceeding had be- fore him (illorss v. 3lorss, 11 Barb. 510; Code Rep. [N. S.] 374), even though he has one or more co-referees. (lb.),ArT. 8.-Control of the court over reference. The reference is considered as a proceeding in the court, and the referees as officers of the court. (See Boanler v. MePhail, 31 Barb. 10(.),The court has, therefore, entire control over the pro- ceeding until the report is filed, and may enlarge the powers of the referees (i,'raser v. Phelps, 4 Sands. 682), may enforce an adjournment of the reference (SIIdam v. Swart, 20 Johns. 476; JBird v. Sands, 1 Johns. Cas. 394), though it will now rarely, if ever, do so (Lanyglcy v. llick- man I Sands. 681; see Cookly v. Hlunltington, sp. t., 16 Abl). ;J84 1.), may compel the referce to proceed to the hearing (3 . S. (5th ed.) 667; [2 id. 384]), and will do so in case of an unreasonable delay (Forrest v. _Forrest, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 650), and may require from them a report of each or any of their decisions with the reasons therefor.

respect of errors which can be considered and corrected on a motion to set aside tle report, or on appeal. (Scher- icr7orn?; v. Derelin, 1 Code Rep. 28; Langley v. Ilick7;ial, 1 Sands. 681.),ARnT. 9.-Bringing on the hearing. Who m1a) bring it on.]-Tle order of reference being granted, either party may, if the reference is for the pur- pose of a trial, proceed to bring' on the hearing. (Thonq)- son v. Krider, sp. t., 8 How. 248; WVilliam1s v. Sagqe, sp. t. Code lRep. [N. S.] 358.),Upon an interlocutory reference (i. c., for any other purpose tlan a trial of the issues), tile path is not so clear. Undoubtedly the party at whose instance the reference is ordered has a right to bring it on, but under tile old chan- cery practice the other party was not allowed to move in the mnatter until the former was in default (Qu(tc7c;ibush v. Leolnrd, 10 Paige, 131; Hollke/ v. Grocer, 9 id. 9), whic was defined by rule (191 of Chancery) to be at the end of thirty (lays from the entry of tile order, after which the latter party was at liberty to apply to the court to have the prosecution of tile reference committed to him. This practice Mir. Van Santvoord (Eq. Pir. 52G) thinks is probably still in force, and perhaps it is; but it seems to us more in consonance with the spirit of the Code to allhv either party to prosecute the reference, giving preference of course to the party at whose instance it was or'dered.,Allppointment of 7le(iing..]-Whatever party has a right to move should first notify the referees of their appoint- ment, which is best done by serving them with a certified copy of tile order (see Boater v. MlcPhail, 31 Barb. 10G; Qutackenlb)ies7l v. Leonard, 10 Paige, 131), and get them to appoint a time and place for the hearing, which it is their duty to do. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 667; [2 id. 384].),It is not absolutely necessary that the referee's appoint- 530,REFERENCE.

Strong, sp. t., 8 id. 339), but it is highly desirable that it slould be (ib.); and a wise referee will always refuse, except iu peculiar circum- stances, to make a merely verbal appointment. When the appointment is nlade in writing, a copy thereof should be served upon) tle adverse party with or before the notice of hearing. (See Sage v. 2.losher, supra.) Place of hearing.]-On a reference ordered by a court of local jurisdiction only, the hearing must be had within the limits of such jurisdiction. (Bouner v. icl'ltail, 31 Barl. 106.) But referees appointed by tile Supreme Court may meet ill any part of the state (Newlandl( v. lrest, 2 Johns. 88), provided they do not select a place inconvenient to either party. (See ib.) And where the place of trial had beeu retained on a motion to chalnge it, by imeans of the plaintiff's swearing to twenty-five witnesses, of whoml he examined only two upon the hearing, the court directed the referees to hold a session in tile defendant's county, upon his paying tlhe expense thereby incurred. (Pierce v. Vooril'es, sp. t., 3 How. 111.) A reference ordered uponl failure to answer is, however, governed by a special rule, andl must be executed il the county specified by the complaint as the place of trial, unless otherwise ordered by the court (Rlile 24, Sulreme Ct.), and if executed in any other county, without such special order, it will be set aside. (Brush v. Mull(ny, sp. t, 12 Abb. 344.) Notice of h7e(rimg.]-Eitler party may notice tle cause for trial before the referees. ('lThomplsonl v. Krider, sp. t., 8 How. 248; Williams v. Sage, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 358.) Such notice is to be given in the same time and manner as upon a trial by tile court. (Code, Â§ 272.) A notice of hearing on an interlocutory reference should,,531
The hearing. Course of proceedings on trial we presume, be one of eight days, unless a shorter notice is permitted by the order of the court.,By appearing and obtaining an adjournment, the ob- jection that the notice was too short is waived. (Wetter v. Schlieper, sp. t., 7 Abb. 92.),ART. 10.-T-Te hearing. Al referees must neet.]-If more than one referee is appointed (which is not now often the case), all must meet together before any business can be done. (3 R. S. (5t7 ed.) 667; [2 id. 384]; Mcinroyj v. Benedict, 11 Johns. 402.) Even an adjournment cannot be ordered unless all are present. (Harris v. Norton, 7 Wend. 534; see Jackson v. Ives, 22 id. 637.),Referees to be sworn.I-Before proceeding to hear any testimony, the referees must be severally sworn faithfully and fairly to hear and examine the cause, and to make a just and tire report according to the best of their under- standing. (3 R. 8. (5thl ed.) 667; [2 id. 384].) This oath may be administered by any justice of the peace, or any officer authorized to administer oaths in the court. (Id.),The statute cited does not expressly refer to any refer- ences ither than to try a cause or take an account; but the court will doubtless require a referee in any case to be sworn.,By proceeding on the hearing without objection, the parties waive the point that the referees are not sworn. (See Keator v. Ulster &c. Plankroad Co., sp. t., 7 How. 41.),Course of proceeding on trial.]--A trial by referees is to be conducted in precisely the same manner as a trial by the court. (Code, Â§ 272.),The referees stand in place of both judge and jury. They have the same discretion as to matters of practice upon the trial as a judge. (See rinlble v. Stilwell, 4 E. D. Smith, 512; Duguid v. Ogilvie, 3 id. 527; 1 Abb. 145; 532
Beacl v. Raymond, 2 E. D. Smith, 496; Gibson v. Pearsall, 1 id. 90.) Thus they may reopen the case after it is closed for the purpose of receiving further testimony (Duguid v. Ogilvie, supra; Cleaveland v. Hunter, 1 Wend. 104), or may refuse to do so (Pearson v. Fiske, 2 Hilt. 146; 7 Abb.. 419; Schermerhorn v. Develin, 1 Code Rep. 28; Trimble v. Stilwell, supra), aid may do so even after they have an- nounced their decision (Ayratlt v. Sac7ett, 17 How. 507; affg S. 0., id. 461; 9 Abb. 154 n.), though not after they have signed their report and given notice thereof to either party (Shearmnan v. Justice, sp. t., 22 How. 241), nor after it has been filed. (Niles v. Price, 23 How. 473.),They may regulate the order of proof (Gibson v. Pear- sall, supra), and the number of witnesses to be examined on one point (Green v. Brown, 3 Barb. 119); may allow leading questions to be put (Beach v. Raymond, 2 E. D. Smith, 496), or a witness to be re-examined after he lias left the stand. (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 285.)*,In all these, and similar cases, referees have discretion to the same extent as judges at circuit, and their action thereon is reviewable only in similar cases.,But they cannot, after admitting evidence as compe- tent, exclude it from consideration in making their deci- sion (Meyers v. Betts, 5 Denio, 81; see Clussman v. Merkel, 3 Bosw. 402); nor will their report be allowed to stand in such case, whether it be against (ib.1, or in favor of the party who put in such evidence (Allen v. Way, 7 Barb. 585); unless the parties consent, expressly or tacitly, to such a course being adopted (TJOihnsoi v. M'Intosh, 31 Barb. 267); or unless the testimony thus excluded from consideration is upon a point concerning which no possi- ble evidence would be admissible, in which case the objection cannot be raised by the party offering it.

(Brooks v. Christopher, 5 Duer, 216.),Variances.]-Even before the power of amendment was conferred upon referees, it was held to be their duty to disregard immaterial variances (Hart v. Hudson, 6 Duer, 294; Harmony v. Bingham, 1 id. 209); and much more obviously is it their duty to do so, now that they have power to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof.,Dismissal of complaint.]-Referees may dismiss the complaint or grant a nonsuit in like manner with a judge at the circuit. (Rule 32, Supreme Ct.) They may not only dismiss it for failure of proof, but upon a simple default on the part of the plaintiff. (Williams v. Sage, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 358; Stephens v. Strong, sp. t., 8 How. 339.)*,What questions are to be considered.]-A referee ap- pointed to hear and decide the whole cause must take any accounts that are necessary to the final determination of the action (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211; see McMahon v. Allen, 27 Barb. 335; 7 Abb. 1; Crosbie v. Leary, 6 Bosw. 312, 327), and though he may announce his decision upon the general issues between the parties, when the taking of an account depends upon such deci- sion (see Pratt v. Stiles, supra), he must go on to take the account before making any report. (Ib.;t see Kappiv. Barthan, 1 E. D. Smith, 622.) * Mathews v. Jones (1 E. D. Smith, 429), and Holmes v. Slocum (sp. t, 6 How. 27), to the contrary, if ever sound in law, are not authority under the present shape of the Code and Rules. t Palmer v. Palmer (13 How. 363), decided by the same judge, intimated an approval of the opposite course. But the doctrine of the text is clealy right.
The hearing. Interlocutory references. The referee in such a case must also pass upon the question of costs, if they are in the discretion of the court (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211; Ludington v. Taft, 10 Barb. 447; Graves v. Blanchard, sp. t., 4 How. 300), or depend upon facts necessarily proved at the trial (&illiland v. Canmlbell, sp. t., 18 Ho*. 177), but not where they are claimed against executors or administrators personally. (Mersereau v. Ryerss, sp. t. 12 How. 300.),ART. 11.-Proceedings on interlocuttory references. The general course of proceeding is much the same upon references of all kinds. We here notice only such matters as are peculiar to references other than for a trial of the issues.,To take proofs.]-On a reference to take proofs, and report a mere opinion thereon, the referee ought to receive all the testimony offered, without regard to its compe- tency (Scott v. Williams, sp. t., 14 Abb. 70), reporting his opinion upon that question as well as upon the facts. (Ib.),He must require the personal attendance of witnesses, and has no power to receive an affidavit as evidence. (Security Fire Ins. Co. v. Martin, sp. t., 15 Abb. 479.),To take accounts.]-On a reference to take an account, the party called upon to account should be required to bring in a written account in the form of debtor and credi- tor, verified by oath (Wiggin v. Cans, 4 Sands. 646; see Palmer v. Palmer, 13 How. 363), to the effect that such account is correct on both sides, and that the deponent does not know of any error or omission therein to the prejudice of any of the other parties to the action. (Story v. Brown, 4 Paige, 112.),Although, in Wiggin v. Gans (4 Sands. 646), it was further held that the party accounting must submit to written interrogatories, as under the chancery practice. this was for reasons which no longer exist, and the examina-
tion ought to be oral in all cases in which personal attendance can be had. Indeed the examining party has a direct interest in favor of this course, and none against it.,The following example conveys a sufficient idea of the form in which such an account should be prepared:,Â§ 286. Accountfor submission to referee. I [Title of cause.],Account of the [defendant, C. D.,] of his receipts and disburse- ments from or on behalf of the personal estate of E.

D. The more tedious proceeding by charge, discharge, and surcharge, which was in use under the old equity prac- tice, and was recommended as most expedient in all strongly contested cases (1 Barb. Ch. Pr. 507; Bennett's Master, 83) is not necessary for any good purpose under the new system of oral examination. The freest scope should be given by the referee to the examination of witnesses and correction of accounts upon both sides, subject only to the ordinary rules of evidence; and where this is done, we can conceive of no occasion upon which the technical chancery practice need be resorced to. Thos 536,REFERENCE.
Interlocutory references. To examine.title. To hear claims. who may be disposed to investigate the course of proceed- ing under that practice will find it stated in 1 Barb. Ch. practice, 505-513.,It will, however, be useful to explain that a "charge" is simply a statement of the adverse party's indebtedness, a "discharge" is a counter statement on his part, and a "surcharge" is a new "charge" against him of items omitted in the account first handed in. (1 Barb. Ch. Pr. 507-509.),To examine title.]-On a reference to examine a title, it is proper that an abstract of title should be submitted by the vendor, and it may be required by order of the court (1 Barb. Ch. Pr. 520), though in general the referee can enforce its production by simply refusing to accept other evidence until that is pioduced. This, however, he should do only as against the vendor. Under the chancery practice, in which all references were made to a master, he would sometimes require that the assistance of an experienced conveyancer should be procured, and claimed the right of making his own se- lection (see Flouer v. Walker, 1 Russ. 408; Be Collard, 10 Beav. 334), and this practice seems to have been tole- rated, though not expressly sanctioned. There is no excuse for such a mode of proceeding in this state. A competent referee should be selected, or if he finds himself unequal to the task, he should send the parties to the court for a new appointment. So where necessary parties to the action are wanting, the referee ought not to report a good title upon the plaintiff's undertaking to make them par- ties. (Plumtre v. Odell, 4 Irish Eq. 602 n.),To hear claims.]-On a reference for the purpose of hearing claims upon a fund in court in a creditor's action, all claims not raised by the pleadings must be presented in writing, with an affidavit annexed to each, to the effect (either positively or upon information and belief), that the,68,537
FOLLOWING,PAGE(S) MUTILATED
amount thus claimed is justly due to the deponent as set forth in such claim; and that neither the claimant nor any person by his order, or to his knowledge or belief, for his use, has received any part of the sum thus claimed, or any security or satisfaction whatever for any part thereof. (Morris v. Mo uatt, 4 Paige, 142.) This affidavit is required, not so much as proof of the claim, as to pre- vent fictitious claims which the parties themselves know to be unfounded, though having some color of proof. (Ib.) And in addition to such affidavit, the referee must, if any objection is made to such claim, require it to be proved by competent evidence. (lb.),No such provision appears to be made in reference to claims upon the surplus moneys arising from sales under mortgages (see Rulc 76, Supreme Ct.), but a notice of the claim must have been filed with the clerk with whom the report of sale was filed, before such claimant can be heard. (Id.),To sell estates.]-For the mode of proceeding upon a sale by a referee, see post, chap. cxvi.,Divorce cases.]-For regulations concerning references in divorce cases, see Rules 86, 87, 88, 90. 91, Supreme Court.,Partition cases.]-For regulations concerning references in partition suits, see Rules 78 and 79, Supreme Court.,ART. 12.-The report. The final decision of referees must always be in the form of a report to the court by which they were ap- pointed. They are not bound by any oral decision which they may make. (Ayrault v. Sackett, 17 How. 507.),A report avowedly based upon the opinion of some other person than the referee himself, cannot be sustained. (Re Collard, 10 Beav. 334.) 538,REFERENCE.
When to be made.]-Referees are bound, unless other- wise ordered by the court or stipulated by the parties, to make and deliver their report within sixty days from the time at which the action is finally submitted; and in default thereof lose all right to their fees, and the action is to proceed as if no reference had been ordered. (Code, g 273.*),No one can object to a referee's report on account of its being made after the lapse of the sixty days, unless be has, before the report was actually made, taken some step which gives notice to the adverse party of his inten- tion to proceed in the action as though no reference had been had. (Mantles v. Myle, 26 How. 409; Foster v. Bryan, sp. t., 16 Abb. 396; 26 How. 194; Irivingston v. Gidney, sp. t., 25 How. 1.) But if, before the report is made, and after the sixty days have expired, a party moves to vacate the order of reference, a report subse- quently made should be set aside upon his motion. (Litch v. Brotherson, 16 Abb. 384.),Compelling report.]-The proper mode of compelling a report is by procuring an order that it be made within a certain time, or that in default thereof an attachment issue (see Tlwmpson v. Parker, 3 Johns. 260); but such a course is rarely pursued, the loss of fees being considered a sufficient stimulant to the energies of referees, and all which it is prudent for the parties to exercise.,How agreed upoon.]-Where there are several referees, all must have notice of the meeting at which the report is to be settled (Brower v. Kingsley, 1 Johns, Oas. 334); though if all having been consulted, a majority agree upon a report, and the dissentient tells the others that they may sign it without him, such report, though signed,* As amended, 1862, 1863. --,539 REFERENCE.
The report. Upon all the issues. Upon particular questions. on another day in his absence, is valid. (Clark v. Fraser, sp. t., 1 How. 98.) Of course the decision of the majority is controlling, and a report may be made thereon, without unanimous consent.,Report upon all the issues.]-Under a reference of all the issues, the report must pass upon all them (Rogers v. Beard, 20 How. 282; see Yan Steenbergh v. Hoffman, sp. t., 6 How. 492), except those upon which no evidence has been offered (see Ingrahamn v. Gilbert, 20 Barb. 151; Pat- tcrson v. Graves, 11 How. 91), of which it need not take any notice. (Ib.),It need not mention allegations of the pleadings which are disproved, as these are sufficiently negatived by the general finding. (Nelson v. Ingersoll, 27 How. 1.),The report must state the facts found, and the conclu- sions of law, separately. (Rule 32, Supreme Ct.;* Code, Â§ 272; Roberts v. Carter, 28 Barb. 462; 17 How. 524; Rog- ers v. Beard, 20 id. 282; Hulce v. Sherman, 13 id. 411; Yorks v. Peck, sp. t., 14 id. 416; Church v. Erben, 4 Sands. 691; see Snook v. Fries, 19 Barb. 313.),Everything necessary to support the judgment must be inserted in the statement of facts, as no fact will be in- ferred from the conclusions of law (Tomlinson v. Mayor of N. Y., 23 How. 452; see Hickok v. Bliss, 34 Barb. 321), although a finding of fact may be interpreted by the help of a finding of law. (Smith v. Devlin, 23 N. Y. 363.),Findings of fact should be direct, positive and explicit, not leaving any material question to be determined by inference or argument.,Report on particular questions.]-The report of referees appointed to inquire into questions of fact should state the facts found, and not the evidence, whether with or *In Johnson v.

without the conclusions of fact. (Re Hemiup, 3 Paige, 305.) Report on title.]-On a reference of a question of title, the report, if adverse to the title, should state the precise points in which it is deemed to be defective. (Green v. iMol7cs, 2 Moll. 325.) If it is in favor of the title, as having always been good, a general report is sufficient, but if it has been made good since the objection was taken, the time at which (see Anon., 3 Madd. 495; Hyde v. Wroughton, id. 279), and the manner in which it was made good, should be stated, if the order of reference includes that branch of. the subject.,So if it can be made good by paying off incumbrances, &c., the report should be in favor of the title (see Esdaile v. iStephenson, 6 Madd. 366), but should state the nature of the incumbrances and aver that they can be got in (1 Barb. Ch. Pr. 520), showing how it may be done.,But where there are not mere incumbrances on the land, but a superior title to any part of it vested in another person who cannot be lawfully compelled to part with it, the referee must report against the title, and has no right to give an approval thereof conditioned upon the acqui- sition of the other's title. (Esdaile v. Stephenson, 6 Madd. 356; Magennis v. Fallon, 2 Moll. 575.),Delivery.]-Referees must deliver their report to the party in whose favor it is made, and to him only (Richards v. Allen, 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 159), unless otherwise ordered by the court, or unless they file it with the clerk. They have .a right to withhold it until their fees are paid.,If the successful party refuses to take up the report, the adverse party may either procure the referee to file it, or may obtain a special order from the court, allowing him to take it up and enter judgment thereon. The latter course was pursued in Burnett v. Phalon (sp. t., N. Y. Trans., Feb. 27, 1860); and see Ric7ihond v. ranmilton (sp.,541 REFERENCE.
t., 9 Abb. 71 n.) In either case he will have to pay the referee's fees, but can tax them in his costs.,Alteration.]-After referees have signed their report, and notified the successful party thereof, they have no power to alter or withdraw it. (SihearmanL v. Justice, sp. t., 22 How. 241; Niles v. Price, sp. t., 23 id. 473.) Still less. can they do so after it has been confirmed. (Riclardson v. Ward, 13 Beav. 110.),ART. 13.-Exceptions. Exceptions may be taken to the rulings of a referee in the same cases, and the same manner, in which they will lie to the rulings of a judge. (Code, Â§ 272.) And they are as necessary in a proceeding under a reference of a mere collateral question as under a reference of the issues (Marshall v. Smith, 20 N. Y. 251); if any question as to the correctness of the decision is to be raised other than as to the mere justice of the legal conclusions upon the facts found (lb.), for which purpose no exceptions are necessary. (lb.; Kirby v. litzpatrick, 18 N. Y. 484.),Such exceptions must be taken to a report upon the issues within ten days after service of notice of the judg- ment (Code, Â§ 268) and a copy of the report (Rule 32, Supreme Ct.), and must be taken to other reports within eight days after notice of the filing thereof. (Rule 32.),Objections to any ruling in the course of the hearing, which, if raised then, might have been obviated, cannot be raised for the first time by exceptions to the report, whether such report be upon the issues (see ante, p. 513), or upon other questions. (See Belnont v. Smith, 1 Duer, 675.) Exceptions must be specific, not general. (Pearson v. Knapp, 1 Myl. & K. 312; Ward v. Fitzhugh, 7 Sim. 42; Compertz v. Best, 1 You. & 0. Ex. 114; but see Woods v. Woods, 10 Sim. 197; Moore v. Langford, 6 Sim. 323.) They should state the exact question to be decided. (Cul- len v. Dean of ildare, 2 Irish Eq. 133; Stocken v. Dawson, 2 Phil. 141.) 542,REFERENCE.
ART. 14.-Proceedings on report. Report on all the issues.]-A report made under a refer- ence of all the issues stands as the decision of the court, and judgment may be entered thereon in precisely the same manner as upon such a decision. (Code, Â§ 272; see Dana v. Howe, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 306.) It is not there- fore necessary or proper to move for the confirmation of such a report. The report must be filed, as part of the judgment roll (Code, Â§ 281); and a copy must be served with notice of the judgment. (Rule 32, Suprenwe Ct.),Report upon specific questions.]--In references other than for the trial of the issues, the report must be filed with the clerk of the court, who must enter the date of filing under the title of the cause in the proper book. (Rule 32.) Notice of such filing should be served upon the adverse party, and unless exceptions thereto are filed and served within eight days after service of such notice, the report stands absolute, and as in all things confirmed, without any special order. (Id.*) Exceptions duly filed and served may be brought to a hearing at any special term, on the notice of any party interested therein. (Id.),The delay of eight days thus provided for may be waived by the written consent of all the parties appear- ing in the cause (Somers v. Milliken, 7 Abb. 524); and where none of the defendants appear, the report may be presented to the court for confirmation at once. (Ib.),ART. 15.-Reviewing report. Appeal.]-The only mode of reviewing errors in the final decision of referees appointed to decide all the issues, * As to the practice prior to this rule, see Blmont v. Snmith (I Duer, 675); rffing v. Slate (sp. t., 5 How. 205).,543 REFERENCE.
is by appeal. (Code, %Â§ 272, 268; Dana v. Howe, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 306.),But it is not the method by which an omission to state the findings of fact is to be corrected. (Hukle v. Sherman, 13 How. 411.),Setting aside.]-The report of referees upon the whole issues cannot be set aside on the mere ground that the conclusions of law drawn by them from the facts (Dana v. Howe, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 306), or the conclusions of fact drawn from the evidence, are erroneous. (See Code, 272.) The principles which regulate the action of the courts upon a motion to set aside the report of a referee are substantially the same as upon a motion to set aside a verdict for any cause other than a simple error in deter- mining a question of fact or of law.,The report will be set aside where a referee has listened to any statements about the controversy in the absence and without the consent of the moving party (Dorlon v. Lewis, sp. t., 9 How. 1), or where he has agreed to render a decision upon the understanding that no judgment shall be entered thereon (ib.), or has assured each party pri- vately that he should decide in his favor. (Roosa v. Sauger- ties &c. Turnpike Co., sp. t., 12 How. 297.),If the report does not pass upon all the issues referred, it should be set aside (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211), and so should a report of referees appointed to decide issues, which does not contain a statement of the findings of law and fact separately (see Hulce v. Shermnan, 13 How. 511; Church v. Erben, 4 Sands. 691), especially if the referees, or any of them, have since removed from the state. (Peck v. Yorks, sp. t., 14 How. 416.),Correction.-An error in computation, obvious upon the face of the report, may be corrected by the court, without sending it back to the referee, and without ex- ceptions. (Bogert v. Furiman, 10 Paige, 496.) 544,REFERENCE.
And a clause added to the report by a referee, after his control over it had ceased, was struck out by the court. (Shearman v. Justice, sp. t., 22 How. 241.),In several cases the courts have assumed that they had the power to send a referee's report back to him for cor- rection without ordering a new trial. Thus such a course has been held proper where the report does not contain a proper statement of findings of fact and law (Hulce v. Sghernta, 13 How. 411; see Churcl v. Erben, 4 Sands. 691; Snook v. Fries, 19 Barb. 313; Pecl: v. Yorks, sp. t., i4 How. 416), or where the referee has omitted to take an account necessary to the final disposition of the cause (McMahont v. Allen, 27 Barb. 335; 7 Abb. 1; see Elmore v. Thomas, sp. t., id. 70); or to pass upon all the issues. (See Union Bank v. Mott, 13 Abb. 24' But in the only reported cases in which the subject was fully discussed, it was held that the court had no power to send back the report of a referee appointed to try all the issues, for an additional finding. (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211; Nelson v. Ingersoll, 27 How. 1); and that the only remedy was to order a new trial. (lb.),ART. 16.-Changing referees. The court which appointed a referee may of course remove him at any stage of the action, but will require a substantial reason for doing so. It will not remove him upon any ground of objection which was known to the party applying for such removal at the time of his original appointment, and not then stated. (Perry v. Moore, 2 E. D. Smith, 32.) Nor will the court always discharge him on his own application. (Seo Westbrook v. Dubois, sp. t., 3 low. 26.) The inability or unwillingness of a referee to attend promptly to his duties is good cause for his removal. (See Forrest v. Forrest, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 650.),Upon granting a new trial on the ground that the report is against the weight of evidence, a new referee,69,545 REFERENCE.
should be appointed, if the appellant desires it (Murphy v. Winchester, 35 Barb. 616, 620; Sharp v. Mayor of N. Y., 31 id. 578; 19 How. 193; Schermerhorn v. Van Alen, sp. t., 13 id. 82), but not upon granting a new trial for mere error of law. (Billings v. VYaulerbrelc, sp. t., 15 How. 295.),If the cause is referable only by consent, and the original referee was named by consent, no new referee should be appointed without the like consent. (Billings v. Yanderbrek, sp. t., 15 How. 295.),CHAPTER XCVII.,NEW TRIAL. ARTICLE 1. Of the motion in general.,2. In what cases a new trial will be ordered. 3. Motion upon the judge's minutes. 4. Motion upon a case or exceptions. 6. Motion upon affidavits or otherwise. 6. Case and exceptions. 7. Opening inquest or default. ART. 1.-Of the motion in general. When available.]-A motion for a new trial may be made, in an action which has been tried by a jury, upon any ground which affords sufficient reason for granting a new trial either on motion or appeal. The motion may be made and granted for errors in law, committed by the judge at circuit, notwithstanding the existence of a remedy by appeal. (Potter v. Chadsey, 16 Abb. 146.),But after trial by a judge without a jury, or by a referee, errors in law or in fact cannot be reviewed on motion, but only upon an appeal from the judgment (Code, Â§ 268, 272; Walson v. Scriven, sp. t., 7 How. 9.*) A motion for a new * Crist v. Dry Dock Co. (3 Cede Rep. 118, 141), and Scranton v. Bacs (4 Sands 5), were decided before the amendments now in force. 546,NEW TRIAL.
trial will not, therefore, be heard after such trial on the ground that the decision was against evidence or the weight of evidence (Watson v. Scriven, supra), or that the judge or referee erred in any of his rulings. A new trial may, however, be granted on motion upon the ground of surprise, newly discovered evidence, irregu- larity, or misconduct of the judge or referee. (See Boosa v. Saugerties &c. Turipike Co., sp. t., 12 How. 297; Dor- 0ao v. Lewis, sp. t., 9 id. 1.) Whlen to be rnade.]-A motion for a new trial cannot now be heard afterjudgment (Guruey v. Smithson, 7 Bosw. 396; Barnes v. Roberts, 5 id. 73; Jalckson v. Fassitt, 12 Abb. 281; 33 Barb. 645; aff'g S. 0., 9 Abb. 137; 17 How. 453; Peck v. Hiler, 30 Barb. 655; Ball v. Syracuse & Ustica . B. Co., sp. t, 6 How. 198; see Morange v. Morris, 12 Abb. 164; Hastings v. McKinley, 3 Code Rep. 10; An- derson v. Dickie, 26 How. 199; 17 Abb. 83; but compare Tucker v. White, 27 How. 96), unless leave to make the motion afterwards is specially given by the court (see ib.), or unless the judgment is entered merely as security. (lb.; Begwdict v. Caffe, 3 Duer, 669.) This rule does not, how- ever, preclude a motion to set aside the judgment and for a new trial as a matter of favor. It merely requires that the motion, after judgment, should combine the two objects.,The motion must be made promptly, especially if based upon the ground of surprise. (Peek v. Hiler, 30 Barb. 655; Rapelye v. Prince, 4 Hill, 119; SJnoihill ads. Knapp, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 15.),Terrs.]-As to the terms upon which a new trial is granted as a matter of favor, see post, chap. cii. In ad- dition to costs, the court some times imposes, as a condi- tion, stipulations of various kinds for the prevention of injustice. The court has no power, on awarding a new trial as a,547 NEW TRIAL.
matter of right, to direct that the evidence taken on the first trial shall stand as evidence in the second. (Bissel v. Hamlin, 13 Abb. 22; _Putnam v. Crombie, 34 Barb. 2324,ART. 2.-In what cases a newv trial will be ordered. A motion for a new trial, after a verdict, may be made upon a case, upon exceptions, or upon the minutes of the judge trying the cause. (Code, Â§ 264, 265.),If made upon exceptions alone, the principles upon which the court decides are precisely the same as upon an appeal, and the discussion of those principles may therefore as well be left for that part of our work. It is to be understood therefore that the principles here stated are applicable (unless otherwise mentioned) only to mo- tions upon a case, upon the minutes, or upon affidavits.,Discretion of the court.]-Motions for new trials are addressed to the discretion of the court, and it rests with the sound discretion of the court to grant or refuse them (Platt v. Munroe, 34 Barb. 291; People v. Dutch7ess C. P., 20 WVend. 658), unless made solely on exceptions (Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank v. Whinfield, 24 Wend. 419), or on the ground of irregularity; and even in such cases, in actions of an equitable nature. (See Clayton v. Yarrington, sp. t., 33 Barb. 145; Forrest v. Forrest, 25 N. Y. 501.),What objections nmay be raised.]-Objections, which, if they had been taken at the trial, might possibly have been obviated, but which were not taken at all (Smith v. Floyd, 18 Barb. 522; Richards v. rSadford, 2 E. D. Smith, 349; Cook v. Hill, 3 Sands. 341; N. Y. & Erie .R. R. Co. v. Cook, 2 id. 732; Stowdard v. Long Island R. R. Co., 5 id. 180; Ford v. Monroe, 20 Wend. 210; Doare v. Eddy, 16 id. 522; Burgess v. Boetefeur, 7 Man. & Gr. 481),'or not insisted upon (Jackson v. Davis, 5 Cow. 123), or not placed at the trial specifically uponi the ground on which they are urged on this motion (Merritt v. Seaman, 6 Barb. 548,NEW TRIAL.
330), will not be listened to, except, perhaps in a pecu- liar ease, where it is absolutely necessary to prevent a failure of justice (see Hastings v. MPKinley, 3 Code Rep. 10; Stoddard v. Long Island R. R. Co., 5 Sands. 180), and then only as a matter of favor, and never as a right. (Ib.),A single exception to a paragraph in a charge, con- taiinig two propositions, was sustained, where the jury appeared to have been misled by one of the propositions, though the other was correct. (Greoe v. Hudson River,Â£. . 32 Barb. 25.) An objection which could not have been obviated at the trial may be raised for the first time on this motion. (Kirby v. Sisson, 2 Wend. 550; Rich ads. Peifield, 1 id. 380; see Merritt v. Seaman, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168; Lawrence v.. Barler, 5 Wend. 301.),A formal exception is not necessary to raise an objec- tion for the consideration of the court upon this motion. (Arcler v. Hubbell, 4 Wend. 514; see People v. Holmes, 5 id. 191; Keyes v. Devlin, 3 E. D. Smith, 518.),Harmless errors.]-A new trial cannot be granted on account of an error which has clearly done no harm, even on exceptions (Ledyard v. Jones, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 550; see post, chap. cxxiv., art. 14), much less upon a case. (Vallance v. Kiug, 3 Barb. 548; Smith v. Kerr, 1 id. 155; Hunt v. Fish, 4 id. 324; Mansfield v. Wheeler, 23 Wend. 79; Benjamin v. Smith, 12 Wend. 404.) It follows as of course that the fact of a wrong reason being given by the judge at trial for a correct ruling, is no ground for a new trial. (Munro v. Potter, 34 Barb. 358; 22 How. 49.) But a verdict given upon an erroneous ground, cannot be.re- tained upon a theory not suggested at the trial. (Graham v. Larke, 12 0. B. 85.) A new trial is not granted upon a motion of this kind, * Reversed, on the ground that the objection could not have been obviated (6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168).,549 NEW TRIAL.
In what cases. Harmless errors. Trival claims. where the court can see with certainty that upon the whole case substantial justice has been done, notwithstanding some of the proceedings have been erroneous (Lansing v. Russell, 13 Barb. 510; Hunt v. Fish, 4 id. 324; Horton v. Hendershot, 1 Hill, 118; High v. Wilson, 2 Johns. 46; see Hayden v. Palmer, 7 Hill, 385; Del. & Hudsono Canal Co. v. Dubois, 15 Wend. 87), and if the decided weight of competent evidence is in favor of the verdict rendered, it should be allowed to stand, even though some incom- petent evidence to the same effect was received* (lb.; Smith v. Kerr, 1 Barb. 155; Mitchell v. Hinman, 8 Wend. 667, 672; Gardinier v. Tubbs, 21 id. 169; but see Anthoine v. Coit, 2 Hall, 40), or some misdirection was given to the jury. (Alston v. Jones, 17 Barb. 276; Depeyster v. Columbiax Ins. Co., 2 Cai. 85.),It has indeed been held that unless it was affirmatively shown that injustice had probably been done, a new trial should be denied (Crary v. 8prague, 12 Wend. 41); but other cases state a less stringent rule. (Clark v. Crandall, 3 Barb. 613; McGuire v. O'Balloran, Hill & D. Supp. 85.),If there is any reason to suspect that the admission of illegal evidence has had any effect upon the verdict, a new trial should be granted (Green v. Hudson Riier R. R, 32 Barb. 25; Gillet v. Mead, 7 Wend. 193), and if the evi- dence was conflicting, the admission of any incompetent evidence which might possibly prejudice, ought not to be overlooked. (Whiting v. Otis, 1 Bosw. 420.),Trivial clainms.-A new trial will not be ordered in favor of a plaintiff against whom there is a merely nega- tive verdict, and the proof shows that he is entitled to nominal damages only, the action being one in which be would have to pay costs upon such a recovery (Hopkin v. Grinnell, 28 Barb. 533; see M'Conihe v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., 20 N. Y. 495), and indeed it has been so held,h t is otherwise on eucption . (Wibms v. 1~th, 18 N. Y. 546.) 550
in actions in which nominal damages would carry costs. (Rundcll v. Butler, 10 Wend. 119; Hyatt v. Wood, 3 Johns. 239.) On the same principle, a new trial will not be granted in any other case where the difference between what the judgment will be, and what it ought to be, is trivial. (Fan Slyck v. Hogeboom, 6 Johns. 270; Hunt v. Burrel, 5 id. 137; Fleiing v. Gilbert, 3 id. 528.),The mere question of costs is not usually of sufficient importance to warrant a new trial (Seymour v. Deyo, 5 Cow. 289), and if the plaintiff has erroneously recovered a verdict for nominal damages carrying costs, he may be allowed to discontinue without costs, instead of going to a new trial. (Fleming v. Gilbert, 3 Johns. 528.),Errors in charge.]-A violation of any of the rules heretofore stated in regard to the judge's charge is ground for a new trial, unless it is plain that the party raising the objection was not prejudiced thereby.,Thus a new trial will le granted where the judge sub- mits questions to the jury, concerning which there is no evidence (Castanos v. Ritter, 3 Duer, 370; Small v. Smith, 1 Denio, 583; Harris v. Wilson, 1 Wend. 511; Dolsen v. Arnold, sp. t., 10 How. 528), or takes a question from the jury which ought to be submitted to them (Utica Ins. Co. v. Badgjer, 3 Wend. 102), even though it is not improbable that they would have decided it the same way (Highland Bank v. Wynkloop, Hill & D. Supp. 243), or gives them a misdirection which may have decided the verdict. (War- deli v. Hugies, 3 Wend. 418; see Sayre v. Townsend, 15 id. 647; Palmer v. Andrews, 7 id. 142; Castanos v. Ritter, 3 Duer, 370.),And a new trial should be granted, even though the charge is susceptible of a construction consistent with the law, if it was likely to mislead the jury on a vital point. (Harding v. Barney, 7 Bosw. 353.),It will not, however, be granted on account of a misdi- rection which plainly worked no practical injustice. (Alston,551 NEW TRIAL.
v. Jones, 17 Barb. 276; Depeyster v. Colunmbian Ins. Co., 2 Cai. 85.),Comments upon the evidence, indicating an opinion in favor of either party upon the facts of the case, are not usually a ground for a new trial, if the evidence was fairly stated. (Lansing v. Russell, 13 Barb. 510; Gardiner v. Picket, 19 Wend. 186; Jackson v. Tinmmernman, 12 id. 299; Petty v. Anderson, 3 Bing. 170: Davidson v. Stanley, 2 Man. & Gr. 221.) And even a recommendation to find a particular verdict is not ground for a new trial, if the evidence amply justified such a verdict, and the jury were left at liberty to decide. (Dean v. Hewitt, 5 Wend. 257.),Errors of discretion.I--On a motion of this kind, the exercise of discretionary powers by the judge may be reviewed, and if, upon an inspection of the whole case, it appears that he has erred in his judgment to the prejudice of either party, a new trial should be ordered.,Thus, a new trial has been granted on account of an injudicious refusal to permit the introduction of further evidence after the case had been closed (Mercer v. Sayre, 7 Johns. 306), although in most instances the court has refused to interfere. (Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 267; Mea- kin v. Anderson, 11 Barb. 215; Ford v. Niles, 1 Hill, 300.),Irregularities of the jury.j-A new trial may be granted on motion, where the conduct of the jury has been irregu- lar, if either party has been actually prejudiced thereby (Oliver v. First Presb. Cahurch, 5 Cow. 283; Brant v. Sow- ler, 7 id. 562), but not unless prejudice is affirmatively shown. (Eager v. Hager, 38 Barb. 92.),As to what irregularities will be noticed by the court, see ante, p. 488.,Verdict against evidence.]-A new trial may be granted where the verdict, decision or report is against the weight of evidence (Conrad v. Williams, 6 Hill, 444), though this will not be done unless it is very clear that such is the 552,NEW TRIAL.
case (People v, Townsend, 37 Barb. 520; Williams v. Â¥an- derbilt, 29 Barb. 491, 504; Coddington v. Carnley, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 528; Stodlard v. Long Island R. B. Co., 5 Sands. 180; Fleming v.-'Hollenback, 7 Barb. 271; W'inchell v. Latham, 6 Cow. 682; see Heritage v. Hall, 33 Barb. 347),* especially upon a question of fraud (People v. Townsend, 37 Barb. 520), or where the verdict is against a claim for a forfeiture, e. g., a defense of usury. (Mansfield v. Wheeler, 23 Wend. 79; Rice v. Welling, 5 id. 595.) A verdict in favor of such a claim is not thus favored. (East River Bank v. Hoyt, sp. t., 22 How. 478.),The doctrine that a new trial cannot be granted, if there is a scintilla of evidence to support the verdict, "is ex- ploded." (Mellors v. Shaw, 1 Pest & Sm. 437; see Avery v. Bowden, 6 Ell. & Bl. 953; WIheelton v. IIardisty, 8 id. 232; Tooamey v. London & Brighton, B. R., 3 C. B. [N. S.] 146.) A verdict against evidence, i. e., contrary to uncontra- dieted and unimpeached evidence, must in every case be set aside (Dunl7uin v. Waterman, 17 N. Y. 9; 6 Abb. 357; Ma7cey v. N. Y. Central R. . Co., 27 Barb. 528), and a verdict without evidence is treated as if against evidence. (Ward v. Woodburn, 27 Barb. 346.) If the plaintiff's evidence, though uncontradicted, establishes only a possi- bility of the facts upon which his claim is based, a verdict in his favor should not stand. (Sheldon v. Hudson River B. R., 29 Barb. 226; Trewi v. Railway Pass. Assur. Co., 5 Hurl. & N. 211.t) But a verdict will not be disturbed on the mere ground that the evidence was not strong. (Williams v. Yanderbilt, 29 Barb. 491, 504; see Mackey v. N. Y. Central R. R., 27 id. 528, 540.),Where a verdict has been rendered on a second trial contrary to the rule of law decided by the court in grant- ing a new trial, a third trial will be ordered (Wilkie v. * This case, being an appeal from the judgment, was not one in which the court had a right to consider the weight of evidence. t Reversed on other grounds, 6 H. & N. 839.,70,553 NEW TRIAL.
Roosevelt, 3 Johns. Cas. 206; Silva v. Low, 1 id. 336; see Gilligan v. N. Y. &d Harlem R. R. Co., 1 E. D. Smith, 452), but this will not be done where the verdict is merely against the weight of evidence. (Fowler v. .ztna Ins. Co., 7 Wend. 270; Talcot v. Commercial Ins. Co., 2 Johns. 467.),Penal actions are, however, an exception to the general rule. A new trial is never granted in such actions in favor of the plaintiff, on the mere ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence (Wteeler v. Calkins, 17 How. 451; Overseers of Rochester v. Lunt, 15 Wend. 565; Baker v. Richardson, 1 Cow. 77; see Lawyer v. Smith, 1 Denio, 207), or even against uncontradicted evidence. (Comfort v. Thompson, 10 Johns. 101; Ranston v. Ettcr- idge, 2 Chitt. 273.),Actions for libel, slander, or malicious prosecution, are also exceptions to the general rule, though not to the same extent as penal actions. A verdict for the defend- ant in such an action will not be set aside on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence (Ex parte Baily, 2 Cow. 479; Hurtin v. Hopkins, 9 Johns. 36; Jarvis v. Hatheway, 3 id. 180; see Rundell v. Butler, 10 Wend. 119), unless it is palpably the result of prejudice, partiality, or corruption, in which case it should be set aside. (See Rundell v. Butler, supra; Levi v. Milne, 4 Bing. 195.),Verdict against charge.]-A verdict contrary to the charge of the judge, the latter not being excepted to, must be set aside, whether the charge was correct or not, inas- much as the unsuccessful party is thereby deprived of the opportunity of excepting. (Rogers v. Murray, 3 Bosw. 357.),Excessive damages.]-In actions other than for personal or willful injuries, it is the constant practice of the courts to grant a new trial where the damages recovered are excessive. (See Harris v. Panama R. R. Co., 5 Bosw. 312; Finch v. Brown, 13 Wend. 601; Moadinger v. Mechanics' Fire Ins. Co., 2 Hall, 490; Sherry v. Frecking,. 4 Duer, 452.) 554,NEW TRIAL.
In actions for personal injuries, the courts are more cautions in their interference, and will not grant a new trial on this ground alone, unless the damages assessed are very clearly excessive-so much so as to indicate that the jury were swayed by improper motives, or acted under a mistake. (Clayp v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 19 Barb. 461; Collins v. Albany & Schen. R. R. Co., 12 id. 492.) Where, however. this is the case, a new trial will be granted. (Ib.),In actions for willful injuries, such as libel (Fry v. Ben- nett, sp. t., 9 Abb. 45; Coleman v. SouthwiC7k, 9 Johns. 45; Southwick v. Stevens, 10 id. 443; Root v. King, 7 Cow. 613), slander (Ryckmaln v. Parkins, 9 Wend. 470; Ostrom v. Calkins, 5 id. 263; Douglass v. Tousey, 2 id. 352; Moody v. Baker, 5 Cow. 351; Cole v. Perry, 8 id. 214; see Pot- ter v. Thompson, 22 Barb. 87), malicious prosecution (Bump v. Betts, 23 Wend. 85; Marquisse v. Ormston, 15 id. 368), or assault and battery (Bluhi v. Higgins, 3 Abb. 104; MZConnell v. Hamplton, 12 Johns. 234), the court will not interfere with the damages, unless they are so exces- sive as clearly to indicate that the jury acted under the influence of passion, partiality, prejudice, mistake, or corruption.,There is said to be no precedent for granting a new trial on this ground in an action for seduction (Travis v. Barger, 24 Barb. 614), or for crim. con. (Smith v. Masten, 15 Wend. 270; Duberley v. Gunning, 4 T. R. 651), and verdicts for $3,000 (Travis v. Barger; Smith v. Masten, supra), $10,000 (Chambers v. Canfield, 6 East, 244), and even $25,000 (Duberley v. Gunning, 4 T. R. 651), have been sustained. Even where it was conceded that the daughter of the plaintiff, though debauched, had not been seduced, the court refused to interfere with the damages, saying that it could not do so unless the amount was so excessive as to shock the sense of mankind. (Sargent v. Denniston, 5 Cow. 106.) So in an action for enticing away the plaintiff's wife,,555 NEW TRIAL.
In what cases. Excessive damages. Inadequate damagse. the court will not interfere with the damages, unless it appears that the jury were actuated by improper motives. (Scherpf v. Szadeez7ky, 4 E. D. Smith, 110; 1 Abb. 366.),The courts are nearly as cautious of interfering with verdicts in actions for breach of promise of marriage. In a case tried in Illinois a few years ago, and unreported, a verdict of $100,000 was set aside.,Instead of granting a new trial absolutely, the court may, and often will, direct that a new trial be granted, unless the plaintiff will remit a specified portion of the damages assessed. (Clapp v. Hudson River R. R., 19 Barb. 461; Collins v. Albany & Schen. R. R., 12 id. 492; Potter v. Thompson, 22 id. 87; Diblin v. Murray, 3 Sands. 19.),Inadequtate damages.]-The instances in which a new trial has been granted on account of the inadequacy of damages are few, but the power of the court to do so is undoubted. It seldom occurs, except in actions for personal injuries, that any just complaint can be made of a verdict upon this ground, and in such actions, the courts are very chary of their interference. (See Howard v. Bar- nard, 11 0. B. 653; Gibbs v. Titley, 1 id. 640; Reidall v. Hayward; 5 Bing. N. C. 424).,It does occasionally happen, however, that a jury will render a verdict for a sum absurdly and obviously too small, as a compromise between the views of some of the jurors who favor a verdict for the plaintiff, and others who favor a verdict for the defendant. Where such a course has been adopted, and the evidence shows plainly that the plaintiff was entitled either to a larger sum or to nothing at all, a new trial will be ordered. (Robbins v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 7 Bosw. 1.),Thus, a verdict of a farthing damages for a broken leg (Armytage v. Haley, 4 Q. B. 917), or of $10 for severe bruises and the loss of a tooth (Richards v. Sandford, 2 E. D. Smith, 349), has been set aside.,The court may, however, grant the order conditionally, giving the defendant the option to allow the damages to 556
In what cases. Inadequate damages. Surprisa. be increased to a specified figure or to go to a new trial. (Riclhards v. Sandford; Armytage v. Haley, supra.),It is not to be supposed that a new trial will be granted in every case in which the damages awarded are too small to compensate the plaintiff for the injury suffered. If there are any circumstances in the case which show that the plaintiff is in fault, even in a mere moral sense, the jury may take them into account in estimating the dama- ges. Thus, where an avowed infidel was forcibly and illegally prevented from delivering an atheistical speech, and the jury gave him only a farthing damages, though he proved that he had been put to an actual expense of Â£7 14s., besides the inconvenience of his detention, the court refused to interfere. (Bradlaugh v. Edwards, 11 a. B. [N. S.] 377; see Apps v. Day, 14 0. B. 112.),A motion on this ground can only be made upon a case, and not upon the judge's minutes (Moore v. Wood, 19 How. 405), and of course not upon exceptions.,Sulrprise.]-A new trial may be granted where the applicant was taken by surprise at the trial. Thus, where a witness, duly subpoenaed, suddenly left the court (Tilden v. Gardiner, 25 Wend. 663;. tiggles v. Hal., 14 Johns. 112), where the plaintiff's attorney was subpoenaed to produce a material document, of which he had privately given up the control, but did not disclose the fact until the trial (Jackson v. Waiford, 7 Wend. 62), and where, in an action for seduction, the principal wit- ness swore that the seduction was effected on a certain day, not mentioned in the complaint, and on which day the defendant was able to prove an alibi by witnesses who were not present at the trial (Sargent v. Denniston 5 Cow. 106), a new trial was granted.,The surprise complained of must be on some matter of fact, and not of law. (Craig v. Fanning, sp. t., 6 How. 336.),The plaintiff cannot be heard to complain of surprise at the requirement of evidence on his part clearly called,557 NEW TRIAL.
for by the issues (Jackson v. Roe, 9 Johns. 77), even though he was led by the defendant (without fraud) to suppose that the fact in issue would be admitted. (Taylor v. Har- low, sp. t., 11 How. 285.),Application for a postponement or other relief must be made at the trial, or this motion cannot be heard after- wards. (People v. Marks, sp. t., 10 How. 261; 2 Park. Or. 673; Elmslie v. Wildman, 8 Taunt. 236; see DeLeyer v. Michael, 5 Abb. 203.),Newly discovered evidence.]-New trials are sometimes granted on the ground that, since the trial occurred, the applicant has discovered new and material evidence.,A new trial is never granted on this ground, if the existence of the new evidence was known to the appli- cant before the trial was had (Jackson v. Malin, 15 Johns. 293; Vandervoort v. Smith, 2 Cai. 155; see People v. NY Y. Sitperior Ct., 10 Wend. 285; Fleming v. Hollenback, 7 Barb. 271), even though he had forgotten it at the time of the trial (Fleming v. Hollenbac7c, 7 Barb. 271; People v. N. Y. Superior Ct., 10 Wend. 285), nor if, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, it might have been discovered (Leavy v. Roberts, 8 Abb. 310; 2 Hilt. 285; Fellows v. Emlperor, 13 Barb. 92; Best v. Starks, sp. t., 24 How. 58; People v. Mariks, sp. t., 10 How. 261; 2 Park. Cr. 673; People v. N. Y. Superior Ct. 10 Wend. 285; Floyd v. Jayiw, 6 Johns. Ch. 479), nor if the witnesses whose testi- mony is sought to be introduced are unworthy of belief (Fleming v. Hollenmback, 7 Barb. 271; Williams v. Baldwin, 18 Johns. 489; see Pomroy v. Columbian Ins. Co., 2 Cai. 2(0), nor if it is improbable that they could be obtained at the new trial (Kendrickc v. Delafield, 2 Cai. 67), nor if they could not be compelled to testify as to the facts sought to be proved by them (Sthumway v. Fowler, 4 Johns. 425), nor if the new evidence is not material (Fe/- lows v. nEmperor, 13 Barb. 92), or is merely cumulative (Adams v. Bush, 23 How. 262; Peck v. Hiler, 30 Barb. 655; Fellows v. Emperor, 13 Barb. 92; Nason v. Coclcroft, 558,NEW TRIAL.

Evans, 15 Johns. 210; Smith v. Brush, 8 id. 84; Stein- bacl v. Colhtbian Ins. Co., 2 Cai. 129; Halsey v. Watson, 1 Cai. 24), or merely in, impeachment of witnesses (Mea. kint v. Anderson, 11 Barb. 215; Fleming v. Hollenbackc, 7 id. 271; Beach v. Tooker, sp. t., 10 How. 297; Harrington v. Bigelow, 2 Denio, 109; Shumway v. Fowler, 4 Johns. 425; Bualn v. Hoyt, 3 id. 255), except in very rare cases, such as where the whole question is one of the identity of persons long deceased, in which cumulative evidence (Jackson v. Crosby, 12 Johns. 354), or new evidence in im- peachment of witnesses (Jackson v. Hooker, 5 Cow. 207; Jackson v. Kinney, 14 Johns. 186) has been admitted as a ground for a new trial. Where it clearly appears that a witness has made a mistake in his testimony, upon a material point, which probably decided the verdict, a new trial will be granted (Coddilgton v. Hunt, 6 Hill, 595; lRichardson v. Fisher, 1 Bing. 145), but not where the witness acknowledging a mistake is only one of several who testified to the same point. (Mersereau v. Pearsall, sp. t., 6 How. 293.) In an action on a note, the defense being forgery, a new trial was granted on the ground that the note, which at the time of the trial was lost, had since been found. (Platt v. Mulnroe, 34 Barb. 291.) Actions for land.]-The courts have always been more liberal in granting new trials in actions of ejectment than in any other actions. (See Jackson v. Dic7Eenson, 15 Johns. 309; Jackson v. Laird, 8 id. 489.) The Revised Statutes, however, have extended this liberality still further, giving to any party against whom judgment is rendered on a verdict in ejectment an absolute right to a new trial, on payment of all costs and damages recovered, at any time within three years after judgment. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 596;,559 NEW TRIAL.
[2 id. 309].) Within two years after the rendition of judgment upon such second trial, the court may, in its discretion, and if it is satisfied that the ends of justice will be thereby promoted, grant a third trial. (lb.),No more than two new trials can, however, be granted by virtue of this provision (ib.), and if the action is thrice tried in an inferior court, it cannot be retried in the Supreme Court upon being transferred thereto. (Brown v. Crinm, 1 Denio, 665.) Nor can a third new trial be ordered, even where one party succeeds at one of the new trials, and the other at the next. (Bellinger v. Martindale, sp. t., 8 How. 113.) But any number of new trials may be ordered, where the principles applicable to other actions justify such a course, as for error, verdict against evidence, and the like.,The time prescribed by the statute runs from the date of the judgment on the verdict, and not from the period of its affirmance on appeal. (Chaultaulqa Co. Bank v. White, 23 N. Y. 347.),Within five years after the docketing of a judgment in ejectment taken by default, the court may, on application of the defendant, his heirs or assigns, and if satisfied that justice will be thereby promoted, vacate the judgment, and grant a new trial, upon payment of all costs and damages recovered. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 596; [2 id. 309].),All these provisions apply to actions for the recovery of real property under the Code (Rogers v. Wing, sp. t., 5 How. 50; Cookie v. Passage, sp. t., 4 id. 360), but not to controversies submitted to the general term without action (Lang v. Rolp7e, 1 Duer, 701), nor to proceedings for the determination of conflicting claims to real property. (Malim v. Rose, 12 WVend. 258.),In an equitable action which, in effect, determines the title to land, the court will deal very liberally in allowing a new trial. (Clayton v. Yarrington, sp. t., 33 Barb. 146.) 560,NEW TRIAL.
Motion upon the judge's minutes. When may be made.,ART. 3.-Motion upon tle judge's minutes. The judge who tries a cause before a jury may, in his discretion, entertain a motion to be made on his minutes, to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial upon excep- tions, or for insufficient evidence, or for excessive damages. (Code, Â§ 264.) He cannot listen to a motion based on any other grounds, as for example, upon the inadequacy of damages (Moore v. Wood, 19 How. 405), newly discovered evidence, sur- prise, or the misconduct of the jury. He may hear and decide a motion upon the ground that the verdict was against an the evidence as well as on the ground that it was against the weight of evidence. (Allegro v. Duncan, sp. t., 24 How. 210.),This motion can be heard only at the same term or cir- cuit at which the cause is tried. (Code, Â§ 264.) It is usu- ally made immediately after the close of the trial, and in such case requires no previous notice. If it is not thus made, it will be better to procure an order to show cause from the judge himself, for if a time is appointed for the hearing without consulting him, he is rarely disposed to entertain the motion at all.,No papers are necessary upon this motion, but if the decision is appealed from, a case or exceptions must be settled in the usual form, upon which the appeal is to be heard. (Code, Â§ 264.) In Shipnman v. Ferris (circuit, February, 1864), the judge, after denying a motion for a new trial on his min- utes allowed a re-argument, and granted the motion.,AnT. 4.-Motion upon a case or exceptions. -,.Where to be made.]-This motion must be made at a circuit or special term (Code, Â§ 265), and cannot be heard at the general term in the first instance (Clarke v. Ward,,71,561 NEW TRIAL.
Motion upon case or exceptions. Vacating order denying new tria. 4 Duer, 206), unless, being made on exceptions alone, the judge trying the cause shall so order. (Code, < 265.),How made and brought on.]-The motion is made and brought on in the same manner as any other motion, except that it must be noticed for the first day of the special term in all cases, even in the city of New York, and that it is put on the calendar as an enumerated motion.,Stay of proceedings.]-It is almost indispensably neces sary to procure a stay of proceedings until the case can be settled, and the motion heard; or else to obtain an order that the entry of judgment be without prejudice to the motion.,It is best to apply for either order to the judge at the trial, inasmuch as he, being in court, can grant a stay for any required period, whereas the powers of a judge out of court are restricted in this respect.,Motion on ground of new evidence.]-On this motion, the facts which it is expected that the witnesses will prove must be stated, so that the court can see that they are material. (Hollingsworth v. Napier, 3 Cai. 182.) The affidavits of the witnesses themselves must be submitted, or proof that they cannot be procured. (Dunn v. Monel, 1 Hall, 382; see Shutmway v. Fowler, 4 Johns. 425.),A case must be prepared upon this motion, unless it is made upon the judge's minutes. It cannot be heard upon affidavits alone. (Anon., 7 Wend. 331; see Bule 34, Supreme Ct.),Vacating order denying new trial.]-If, after a new trial has been denied, the ground of the decision is destroyed by a superior authority-as where it was based solely,* This section has been amended since the decision in Felows v. Empero (13 Barb. 92). 562,NEW TRIAL.
Motion upon affidavits or otherwise. Affidavits of jurors. upon a judgment which has been since reversed-the order should be vacated and a new trial ordered. (Giklcrist V. Comfort, 26 How. 394.),ART. 5.-Motion upon affidavits or otherwise. A motion for a new trial can be made upon affidavits alone, only when based on the ground of irregularity or surprise. (Rule 34, Supreme Ct.) The irregularities which can be brought upon this motion are such only as cannot be objected to at the trial. All questions that can be raised there must be and will be reviewed only upon a ease or exceptions. An application for a second trial in an action for land, on payment of costs and damages, requires no papers except proof of the date of the judgment. An applica- tion for a third trial must be supported by evidence show- ing some reason therefor. Affiavits of jurors.]-The affidavits of jurors are not admissible evidence to show that they made a mistake in their verdict (Exp. Caykeiuloll, 6 Cow. 53; Jackson v. Williamson, 2 T. R. 281; see Brownell v. McEiven, 5 Denio, 367), or gave it under a misapprehension of its effect 1People v. Columbia 0. P., 1 Wend. 297), or were guilty of misconduct during the trial or consultation. (Green v. Bliss, sp. t., 12 How. 428; Clumn v. SmitJi, 5 Hill, 560; Dana v. Tucker, 4 Johns. 487; Owenl v. Warburton, 4 3os. & Pul. 326; Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R. 11.) But such affidavits are admissible to show that a mis- take was made by the foreman, in delivering the verdict ,(Cogeit v. Ebdent, 1 Burr. 383), or by the clerk in recording it (Ja7ckso8n v. Dickenson, 15 Johns. 309; see Roberts v. ,Hughes, 7 Mees. & W. 399); or to show that an error was yiade by the judge in his charge (Sargent v. Denniston, 5 Bow. 106), or to prove an attempt on the part of the su:cessful party to tamper with the jury. (Re1nolds v. C12amplain Trals. Co., sp. t., 9 How, 7.),563
Motion upon affidavits. Case and exceptio,. And such affidavits are always admissible in support o the verdict (Nesmith v. Clinton Fire Ins. Co., sp. t., 8 Abb. 141; Eastwood v. People, 3 Park. Cr. 25; Dana v. Tucker 4 Johns. 487), though they are regarded as very unreliable evidence. (Eastwood v. People, supra.),Affidavits of other persons as to misconduct of the jury, containing only information derived from the jurors, are inadmissible to impeach the verdict. (People v. Hartung sp. t., 8 Abb. 132; People v. Wilson, sp. t., id. 137.),AnT. 6.-Case mdu exceptions. Necessity of case.]-Whenever a motion is made for a new trial (except for irregularity or surprise, or upon the judge's minutes), or it is sought in any other way to re- view a trial of any kind, a case or exceptions, or ca~ containing exceptions, as may be proper and the moving party may elect, must be prepared and served by such party. (Rule 34, Suprene Ct.),When to be served.]-A copy of such case or exceptiona must be served on the opposite party within ten days afte the trial, if by a jury, or after written notice of the filing of the decision or report, if the trial was by a judge oi referee. (Rule 34, Supreme Ct.) AI,If not served within such time, the right to make a case, &e., is lost. (Rule 35, Supreme Ct.),Form and contexts of case.]-A ease should contain, s much of the evidence and proceedings on the trial as an by any possibility have a bearing upon the questions raised on the motion; and as it is generally difficult to say what will not have such a bearing, it is usual to in everything of the kind, and also to incorporate the plep, ings, either bodily or by express reference. . !i,Where a case isprepared solely for use upon a, appl, from a, iudgment oni a, verdict, it shouldi be, carefi purged from all matters which are not necessary to big 564,ËNEW TBIAL.

Proutdit, 6 Bosw. 191.) Nor will the former statement be resorted to in support of a forced ,construction of the latter. (lb.),Exceptiols.]-Where a case is made, the exceptions should be invariably included, from considerations of manifest expediency. We believe that it is now the universal practice to pre- pare a case, and that a motion upon exceptions only is rarely made, unless it is desired to have the motion heard at the general term at once. 'The form in which exceptions should be taken and stated is sufficiently described, ante, p. 502. If exceptions are prepared separately, they need not be signed nor sealed by any judge. (Code, Â§ 264.) They must contain no more of the evidence than is necessary to present the questions of law upon which they are founded; and it is the dutyof the judge, upon settlement, to strike out all unnecessary matter. (Rule 36, Supreme Ct.; see Zabriskie v. Smith, 11 N, Y. [1 Kern.] 480.) But they must give so much of the evidence, and such a statement of what occurred at the tial, as will make the point in question plain, and show upon what ground the decision excepted to was made. (See Mead v. Northwestern Ins. Co., 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 530.) And the facts should be stated in a connected form, so as to present them to the court at a glance. (Price v. Powell, 8 R. Y. [3 Oomst.] 322.) iThe former practice of turning a case into exceptions,565 NEW TRIAL.
or a special verdict has no existence under the Code. (See Johnson v. Whitlock, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 344, 350.),Amendments.]-The party served with a case or excep. tions may, within ten days thereafter propose amend. ments thereto, by serving a copy thereof on the moving party. (Rule 34, Supreme Ct.),The amendments proposed must be made either on the margin of a copy of the case, or (which is most conve: nient) upon a separate paper, referring to the lines of the original case affected by the amendments. (Milward v. JIallett, 1 Cai. 344.) It is not allowable to serve an entirely new case as a substitute, by way of amendments (Ib.; Eagle v. Alner, 1 Johns. Cas. 332), except in a very extreme case. (Grah. Pr. (2d ed.) 332.),Settlement of case.]-Within four days after service of the amendments, the moving party may serve on his opponent a notice that the papers will be submitted for settlement to the judge or referee before whom the caus was tried, at a time and place to be specified in the notice, such time to be not less than four nor more than twenty days after service thereof. (Rule 34, Supreme Ct.) If no amendments are served, or no notice of settlement given, within the time here prescribed, the case is deemed to le settled, in the former case, as proposed, and in the latter case, with the amendments as served. (Rule 35, Suprem Ct.),Before submitting the papers to the judge or referee, the party proposing the original case or exceptions must mark upon the several amendments proposed his allow- ance or disallowance thereof. (Rule 36, Supreme Ct.),The judge or referee must correct and settle the eas, as he may deem to consist with the facts. (Rule 3&4 Supreme Ct.) He is not bound to settle it in a form cori trary to the facts, even though counsel on both sideo agree thereon. (Root v.Kring, 6 Cow. 569.) He may inert 566,NEW TRIAL.
Case and exceptions. Settlement. Resettlement. Case to be filed. any facts material to the case, of his own motion. (lb.; Walsworth v. Wood, 7 Wend. 483.) The judge or referee may be compelled by mandamus to settle a case or exceptions, and to make it conform to the facts. (People v. Baker, sp. t., 35 Barb. 105; 14 Abb. 19; Sikes v. Ransom, 6 Johns. 279; Delavan v. Boardman, 5 Wend. 132; People v. Washington C. P., 1 Oai. 511.),If the cause was tried by more than one referee, all must unite in the settlement. (Fielden v. Lahens, sp. t., 14 Abb. 48.),Resettlement.]-A case or exceptions may be referred back, on motion, for resettlement, on satisfactory proof that it is not in accordance with the facts. And this is the preferable mode of proceeding in the first instance (Delavan v. Boardman, 5 WVend. 132), although a manda- mus will lie to enforce a correct resettlement, when neces- sary. (lb.; Peoplev. Baker, sp. t., 35 Barb. 105; 14 Abb. 19; Sikes v. Ransom, 6 Johns. 279.*),Case to be filed.]-The case or exceptions must be filed within ten days after settlement thereof, or it will be deemed to be abandoned. (Rule 37, Supreme Ct.) And on filing an affidavit that the same has not been filed, showing the time of settlement, and that more than ten days have elapsed since that time, an order may be en- tered, as of course, declaring such case or exceptions abandoned, and the party may proceed as if none had been made. (Id.),The original case must be filed, and not a mere copy. (Parker v. Link, sp. t., 26 How. 375.),ART. 7.-Opening inquest or default. The opening of an inquest or default is a proceeding somewhat analogous to a motion for a new trial, and for , : In People on rel. Judd v. Heame (N. Y. Trans., June 22, 1864), it was held,'iat the judge could not be compelled to state the facts in any particular Way.,567
Opening Inquest or default. For irregularity. that reason is placed in this chapter. An application of this nature is of very frequent occurrence, and is based upon the ground of either irregularity or favor.,As a general rule, the court will not relieve against a default on the motion of any one not an actual party to the action, and prejudiced by the default; but the default of an insolvent corporation was opened on motion of stockholders personally liable for its debts, the attorney for the corporation having refused to move. (Peck v. N. Y. & Liverpool Steamship Co., 3 Bosw. 622.),An inquest will not be set aside (at any rate as a mat- ter of favor), where the defendant appeared, cross-ex- amined witnesses, and made a case. (Mason v. Bidleman, sp. t., 1 How. 61.),For irregularity.]-An inquest or default, taken in vio- lation of any of the rules prescribed, ante, pp. 448-451, will be set aside on motion, as irrgular. (Smith v. Brown, 1 Duer, 665; Newcomb v. Johnson, 9 Wend. 451.),And bad faith (Anon., sp. t., 6 Abb. 512), or unfair and overreaching practice (Smith v. Bowen, 2 Wend. 245), is treated as equivalent to irregularity. But errors which might furnish ground for exceptions and an appeal, are not regarded as justifying a motion to set aside a default. (Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11.*),An inquest or default taken before the defendant's time to amend his answer expires, though regular when taken, becomes irregular upon the due service of an amended answer, in good faith. (Washburn v. Herrick, sp. t., 4 How. 15.) So, where a motion to change the place of trial is argued before the default is taken, but the decision granting it is not rendered until afterward, the default is,* When it is considered that there can be no exceptions taken on a de- fault, and consequently no appeal (Pope v. Dinsmore, 8 Abb. 429), this seems a hard decision. Such errors ought certainly to have great weight on an application for relief as a favor. 568,NEW TRIAL.
thereby made irregular, the decision taking effect from the time of argument. (Willson v. Henderson, sp. t., 15 How. 90.) For favor.]-The plaintiff is not bound to waive an inquest regularly taken, even upon a tender of costs, but the defendant must resort to his motion. (Smith v. Howard, 12 Wend. 198.),Some reasonable excuse for the party's failure to attend, or to file an affidavit of merits, must be shown on this motion (Post v. Wright, 1 Cai. 111), and a sufficient affi- davit of merits must, as a rule, be served as part of the motion papers (Poplhan v. Baker, sp. t., 1 How. 166; Durant v. Cook, sp. t., id. 43; Colegate v. Marsh, sp. t., 2 id. 137), though, under very peculiar circumstances, the defendant was allowed to supply the want of such an affidavit at the hearing. (Fassett v. Tallmadge, 15 Abb. 205.),The court will not, on this motion, listen to affidavits in contradiction of an affidavit of merits, so far as the question of merits is concerned (Hanford v. McNair, 2 Vend. 286); but where the affidavit is not made by the defendant himself, counter affidavits are admissible to show that the excuse given for his not doing so is false. (Johizson v. Lynch, sp. t. 15 How. 199.),The terms upon which relief will be granted as a matter of favor are in the discretion of the judge to whom the application is made, and he will usually impose the pay- ment of costs (see post, chap. cii.), but ought not to re- quire the abandonment of the defense of usury. (Allen v. Mapes, 20 Wend. 633; see Lovett v. Cowman, 6 Hill, 223.*),This motion is closely analogous to a motion to vacate . *But compare Morris v. SlaSery (sp. t., 6 Abb. 74); Fox v.

Fees of attorneys, how regulated. provisions of law restricting or controlling the right of a party to agree with an attorney or counsel for his com- pensation, were repealed by the Code, and the measure of such compensation is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties. (Code, Â§ 303.),The -allowances called costs are not now the measure of compensation between the attorney and client. The attorney cannot claim the costs as necessarily due to him, in the absence of special agreement (Garr v. Mairet, 1 Hilt. 193; Stow v. Hamlin, 11 How. 452; see Moore v. Wvestervelt, 3 Sands. 762), nor is lie debarred from recover- ing more. If no express agreement has been entered into between them, he is entitled to such compensation as his services are reasonably worth. (Ib.),Attorneys may lawfully stipulate for a share of the proceeds of actions brought by them, as a compensation for their services (Benedict v. Stuart, 23 Barb. 420), except in actions for land, in which such a transaction would amount to a conveyance of land held adversely, which is prohibited. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 972; [2 id. 691].) The re- strictions upon the attorney's right to make such an agreement were part of the old law of champerty (see Benedict v. Stuart, supra; Re Blealdey, 5 Paige, 311; Arden v. Patterson, 5 Johns. 44; Berrien v. McLane, Hoffm. 421), which is wholly obsolete in this state, except in the single instance we have mentioned. (Sedgwick v. Stanton, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 289; Durgin v. Ireland, id. 322.),Nevertheless, the relation of an attorney to his client is a fiduciary one, governed by the general law regulating transactions between trustees and the beneficiaries of their trust. (See Ford v. Harrington, 16 N. Y. 285; Evans v. Ellis, 5 Denio, 640; aff'g Ellis v. Messerire, 11 Paige, 467; Howell v. Ransom, 11 Paige, 538; Howell v. Barker, 4 Johns. Ch. 118.) The attorney cannot therefore use his liberty of agreement as a means of extortion (Barry v. Whitnejy, 3 Sands. 696; Code Rep. N. S. 101), and his,571

(Ib.),, ART. 2.-Lien for costs. The attorney's lien for costs is not abolished by the Code. (Rooney v. Second Av. R. R. Co., 18 N. Y. 368.*),T7te lien.]-An attorney has a lien, for his general bal- lance of costs (1 Archb. Pr. 7th ed., 86; Ezx parte Sterling, 16 Ves. 258; see Lambert v. Bucnmnaster, 2 Barn. & Cr. 616; Ogle v. Story, 4 Barn. & Ad. 735), on all papers (Rez v. San7;ey, 5 Ad. & El. 423; see St. Jol7n v. Diefendorf, 12 Wend. 261) or money (Jones v. Turnbull, 2 Mees. & W. 601), or other property (Friswell v. King, 15 Sim. 191), belonging exclusively to his client (Esdaile v. Oxenham, 3 Barn. & Or. 225; Oxenham v. Esdaile, 2 You. & J. 493; see Hollis v. Claridge, 4 Taunt. 807) which may come into his hands.,He has a lien for his fees in an action (Rooney v. Second Av. It. R., 18 N. Y. 368), whether for debt or unliquidated damages (ib.; Rasquin, v. Knickerbocker Stage Co., 12 Abb. 324; overruling Exparte Hart, 1 Barn. & Ad. 660), on whatever is recovered in that action, even though it does riot come into his possession (ib.); and not only upon the judgment, but also upon all collateral securities for its satisfaction (Shackelton v. Hart, sp. t., 12 Abb. 325 n.), as, for example, an undertaking of bail in the action. (Ib.) This lien extends not merely to the taxable costs, but to the entire amount of compensation agreed upon between the attorney and his client. (Hall v. Ayer, sp. t., 9 Abb. 220; see Rooney v. Second Av. R. R., 18 N. Y. 368; *To the same effect Haight v. oklcomb (7 Abb. 210; 1G How. 173); Hall v. Ayer, sp. t. (9 Abb. 220); Sherwood v. Bufalo &c. R. R. (12 How. 136); Ward v.

Lien for costs. Effect of the lien against third parties. Ackernma v. Ackernan, 14 Abb. 229. To the contrary, Haight v. Holconb, 7 Abb. 210; 16 How. 173.) But the attorney has not a lien on a judgment for a general balance due him. (St. Joh1n v. Diefendorf, 12 Wend. 261; Watson v. Maskell, 1 Bing. N. 0. 366; Phillips v. Stagg, 2 Edw. Ch. 108, Lucas v. Peacock, 9 Beav. 177.),An attorney's lien on property in his possession is lost if he parts with its possession to his client (Dicas v. Stoc7k ley, 7 Carr. & P. 587), even by mistake (ib.), but not if it is unlawfully taken from him. (Ib.) His lien in any case is extinguished by an assignment of the claim (Chappell v. Dann, 21 Barb. 17), and is not revived by a re-assign- ment to the attorney. (lb.),The lien is suspended by the acceptance of any security for the claim (Cowell v. Simpson, 16 Ves. 275), or of a note in payment (Lambert v. BuckJmaster, 2 Barn. & Cr. 616), and the attorney cannot retain the client's property as security for the payment of the note (ib.); but if any pro- perty of the client remains in the possession of the attor- ney when the note is dishonored, his lien thereon revives. (Davies v. Lowndes, 3 0. B. 808; Stevenson v. Blakelock, 1 Mau. & Sel. 535.),Effect of the lien against third parties.]-The attorney's lien is valid against the adverse party to the action (Rooney? v. Second Av. R. R., 18 N. Y. 368), or any other third person (see Martin v. Hawks, 15 Johns. 405; Wil- kins v. Battermnan, 4 Barb. 47; Ex parte Bowden, 2 Dea. & Chit. 182; Jones v. Turnb ull, 2 Mees. & W. 601), if be- fore acquiring any claim in its derogation he has notice thereof (McDowell v. Second Av. R. R., 4 Bosw. 670; Peo- ple v. Hardenbergh, 8 Johns. 335; Pinder v. Morris, Cole. & C. Cas. 489; :3 Caines, 165; and see all cases here cited), pr information which should put him upon inquiry (Ten Broeck v. De, Witt, 10 Wend. 617; Wilkins v.

Knic7erbocker Stage Co., 12 Abb. 324); but not otherwise.,Where a judgment has been entered, on which the attorney has a lien for costs, a collusive settlement between the parties in fraud of his rights will not relieve the debtor from liability to him for such costs (Rooney v. Second Av. R. R., 18 N. Y. 368; Ward v. Wordsworth, 1 E. D. Smith, 598; 9 How. 16; Haiglt v. Holcomb, 7 Abb. 210; 16 How. 173). and if such a settlement is made before judgment, in fraud of the rights of theplaintiff's attorney, he may nevertheless continue the action, and take judgment for his costs (Rasquin v. Knic7kerbocker Stage Co., 12 Abb. 324; Keenan v. Dorflinger, sp. t., 19 How. 153; 12 Abb. 327 nt.; Owen v. Mason, sp. t., 18 How. 156; Wood v. Northwvest Pres. Church, 7 Abb. 210 n.; but see to the contrary, Sweet v. Bartlett, 4 Sands. 661; Benedict v. Harlow, sp. t., 5 How. 347), except in an action for divorce, in which the favor with which the courts look upon a.reconciliation overbalances their favor towards the attorney. (Kirby v. Kirby, 1 Paige, 565.),The attorney proceeds, however, at his own risk, and must show conclusively that the settlement was made in bad faith, with the intent of evading his claim, or his pro- ceedings, subsequent to notice of settlement, will be set aside. (McDowell v. Second Av. IR. R., 4 Bosw. 770; Francis v. Webb, 7 0. B. 731; Clarkl v. Smith, 6 Man. & Gr. 1051; Nrelson v. Wilson, 6 Bing. 568.),The plaintiff's attorney cannot, upon the action being collusively settled before judgment, have an order requir- ing the defendants to pay the costs. (Talcott v. Bronson, 4 Paige, 501.) His only remedy is to proceed in the action, as before mentioned. (Ib.),The defendant's attorney is not permitted to object to any settlement that is made before the cause is decided (Shanck v. Shoemnaker, 18 N. Y. 489; Quested v. Callis, 10 Mees. & W. 18), though after judgment or any decision which substantially determines the action, and fixes his 574

A satisfaction of judgment, entered in fraud of the attorney's lien, will be set aside on his motion (Rooney v. Second Av. R. R. Co., 18 N. Y. 368), but he is not at liberty to disregard such satisfaction, and to issue execution on the judgment before the entry of satisfaction is vacated. (Ac7cerhnjn v. Ackerman, 14 Abb. 229.) An attorney's lien cannot be enforced against the per- son of the adverse party, if his client has released him, even collusively. (Marr v. Smith, 4 Barn. & Aid. 466; Martin v. Francis, 1 Ohitt. Rep. 241.),CHAPTER XCIX. FEES OF OFFICERS OF TIIE COURT.,AaTICLE 1. Fees of the clerk.,2. Fees of the serifs. 3. Fees of referees. ART. 1.-Fees of the clerk. The old fee bill of the Revised Statutes is, as to the clerk's services in civil actions, entirely abolisled (People v. Supervisors of Monroe, sp. t., 15 How. 225), and he is entitled to no fee whatever for any such services, except, 1. On every trial, one dollar; 2. For entering judgment, fifty cents, except when he is a salaried officer, and then one dollar;,3. For copies of papers, five cents per 100 words. (Code, 5 312.),Trialfee.]-As to what is, or is not, a trial, see ante, p. 424.,The clerk is entitled to his trial fee on every trial of an issue, whether of law or of fact (Be Clerk of Albany, 5 How. 11; 3 Code Rep. 102), in court, but not on a trial,575
Clerk's fees. Trial fee. Payment of fees. before a referee (Benton v. Sheldon, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 134; see le Clerk of Albany, supra), nor when a cause is called at circuit, but referred by an order there granted. (Ib.) He is entitled to this fee on an appeal from a judgment, whether of the same court (Re Clerk of Albany, supra), or of another court, whether in an action or special pro- ceeding (ib.; Code, Â§ 318), and upon an argument at general term, of questions reserved at the trial (Wilcox v. Curtiss, sp. t., 10 How. 91); but not on an appeal from a mere order (Re Clerk of Albany, supra), nor on the dis- missal of a complaint for want of progress in the action (Tillspal(ugh v. Dick, sp. t., 8 How. 33), nor on an applica- tion to the court for judgment upon failure to answer. (Chapman v. Lemon, sp. t., 11 How. 235.),Other charges.]-The clerk can make no charge for filing or entering any paper or order (Re Clerk of Albany, 5 How. 11; 3 Code Rep. 102), nor for attending on the hearing of a motion of any kind (ib.); nor can he make any extra charge for his certificate of the correctness of copies of papers. (Ib.),Payment of fees.]-The clerk may require his fees to be prepaid (Purdy v. Peters, sp. t., 15 Abb. 160; 23 How. 328), but not until he is on the point of rendering the service for which he is entitled to the fee. (Malcomb v. Jennings, sp. t., Code Rep. 41.) Thus he cannot require payment of the trial fee until the cause is actually called in court (ib.), nor of the fee on judgment, until judgment is perfected. (Re Clerk of Albany, supra.),The clerk cannot refuse to perform an act for which he is duly paid, on account of non-payment by the party for some previous official act on which he gave credit. (Plrdy v. Peters, sp. t., 15 Abb. 160; 23 How. 328.) ),The trial fee is to be paid by the party bringing on the trial. (Code, Â§ 312.),The fee for entering judgment ischargeable to the 576
Fees of the sheriff. party in whose favor it is entered, even though the costs of the action are awarded to the other party. (Burnett v. restfall, sp. t., 15 How. 430.),ART. 2.-Fees of the sheriff. The sheriff is entitled to the following fees for his services in civil actions. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 924; [2 id. 644].),For serving a summons, fifty cents, and six cents a mile for going only, to be computed from the nearest court house of the county; for returning a writ, 121 cents; for a copy of a writ, 19 cents; for taking any bond, 371 cents; for receiving an execution and entering the same, 50 cents; for summoning common juries, 50 cents a term upon every cause on the circuit calendar; for summoning a special or foreign jury, $1.12Â½; for sum- moning and attending a sheriff's jury, and returning the proceedings, $1.50; for bringing up a witness on a habeas corpus ad testificandtmn, $1.50, and 121 cents a mile for traveling; for attendance at court with such witness, $1 per day, and actual necessary expenses.,For serving and returning service of a notice of no per- sonal claim with a summons, twenty-five (Benedict v. Warriner, sp. t., 14 How. 568), or thirty-seven and a half cents (Gallagher v. Egan, 2 Sands. 742), only should be allowed.,The fees of the sheriff upon an attachment against property have been stated heretofore. (Aite. i, 672, 673.) But since our first volume was published, the question as to the compensation which should be allowed for an attachment under which goods are only seized, and never sold, has been raised, and contradictory decisions made. LEONARD, J., holds that five per cent. and his disburse- ments should be allowed to the sheriff (Trenor v. Fachiln, sp. t., 12 Abb. 136; S. 0., 20 How. 405), while BARNARD, J., allows only a fair compensation according to the time and trouble involved, and not an absolute per centage on the property attached. (Alburtis v. Dudley, sp. t., 12 Abb.,73,577
Fees of the sheriff. What. Who liable for. 361; 21 How. 456.) The latter is in our opinion the fairer rule, inasmuch as under the other decision the sheriff would receive as much fpr merely leaving a notice of levy with a debtor, as for actually selling the goods, and pay- ing over their proceeds.,It seems to be fair that the sheriff should receive five per cent. for actually collecting and paying over small sums of money, and so it has been decided (Mlayhel w v. Wilson, sp. t., 10 Abb. 289; S. 0., 31 Barb. 87), but he ought not to receive a larger percentage on large sluns than he would under an execution.,The whole matter is, however, in the discretion of the judge who issued the attachment, and no binding rule can be laid down.,The fees upon executions, other than the mere charge of 69 cents for receiving, traveling one mile, and return- ing, which is always made, will be stated in the chapter on Execution (post, chap. cxv), inasmuch as they are not taxable, but are to be collected out of the levy.,For serving a writ of replevin, the statute allowed a fee of 50 cents. The action of replevin is abolished, but the proceedings on a requisition of personal property under the Code are a substitute therefor, and we think that the same fee should be allowed to the sheriff for such services. If we are right in this view, his fees thereon will be the same as upon service of a summons. The actual expenses of removing the goods lie is clearly entitled to claim.,In Moore v. Cockroft (9 How. 479), the court struck out of the bill of costs all the sheriff's charges for taking and delivering property, but the decision may have proceeded on the ground that the details of the charges were not stated, as was the fact in that case.,In practice, it will be found that sheriffs pay little attention to the scale of fees prescribed by law, and the legal profession generally submit to their extortions, rather than dispute with them.,Who liable for.]-The attorney of record is liable to the 578
jles of referees. What. Who liable for. sheriff for his fees. (Adams v. Hopkins, 5 Johns. 252; see Ousterwoudt v. Day, 9 id. 114; Judson v. Gray, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 408.) And if he gives credit to the attorney, and the client pays the fees to the latter, the sheriff cannot re- cover them from the client. (Ousterlwudt v. Day, supra.),ART. 3.-Fees of referees. A referee is, in the absence of a special agreement, en- titled to charge $3 per day and no more (Code, Â§ 313; Shultl v. Whitney, sp. t., 9 Abb. 71; 17 How. 471), though the parties may, by mutual agreement in writing, fix a higher rate of compensation. (Ib.) An entry upon the referee's minutes, in the presence and by consent of the parties, is a sufficient agreement in writing for this pur- pose. (Philbin v. Patrick, sp t., 22 How. 1.) The existence of a custom to pay more than $3 without a written agree- ment, does not give the referee any right to such extra sum. (ShultW v. Whitney, sp. t., 9 Abb. 71; 17 How. 471.),A referee cannot charge for time spent by his clerk or agent about the reference, unless by special agreement (Shultz v. Whitney, supra), as the statute allows him com- pensation only for his own personal services. (lb.) Nor has he a right to charge for office rent, or any other ex- penses. (Toorh. Code (6th ed.) 370 d.),Where there is any dispute as to the amount of the referee's fees, he may be required to have them taxed. (Richtmond v. Hamilton, sp. t., 9 Abb. 71 n.),The referee has a lien upon his report for his fees. He may recover his fees from the prevailing party, by action, without any express promise to pay (see Hinnman v. Hapgood, 1 Denio, 188), and where two or more referees are appointed, they may sue separately. (Ib.) But the at- torney in the action is not liable for the referee's fees (Judson v. Gray, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 408), unless he has agreed with his client to pay them. (Judson v. Gray, 17 How. 289, 296.),579
Costs, what. By what statute regulated.,CHAPTER C. COSTS IN GENERIAL. AnTICL.E 1. Costs, what.,2. By what statute regulated. 3. Final and interlocutoly costs. 4. Costs in void proceedings. AnT. 1.-Costs, what. Costs, under the Code, are the sums allowed to a party to an action as an indemnity for his expenses in the action. (Code, Â§ 303.),The term "costs," as used in the Code, generally in- cludes disbursements of all kinds in the action, and not merely those fixed sums which are allowed as a compensa- tion for the labor of the party or his attorney. (Wheeler v. Westgate, 4 How. 209; Belding v. Contklin, sp. t., 4 How. 196; Stone v. Duffy, 3 Sands. 761.),ART. 2.-PBj what statute regulated. Costs in all actions are now wholly dependent upon statute, whatever might have 1een the rule before the Code.,The right of a party to costs is, therefore, wholly de- pendent upon the statute which is in force at the time of the decision under which costs are claimed (Rich v. Husson, 1 Duer, 617; Sup'rs of Ononldaqa v. Briggs, 3 Denio, 173; Hunt v. Middlebrook, sp. t., 14 How. 300; Fisherv. Hunter, sp. t., 15 How. 156), and he acquires no vested right to final costs during the pendency of the action. (Ib.),Final costs are regulated, however, by the statute in force when the verdict is rendered (Moore v. Westervelt, 14 How. 279; Burnett v. Westfall, sp. t., 15 How. 430; Cook v. N. Y. Floating Dock Co., 1 Hilt. 556; Holmes v. Davis, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 46), that is, the final verdict, if there have been more than one in the action, some of 580

Jutdd, sp. t., id. 385), or if the cause was decided without a jury, by the statute in force at the time the decision of the court was made (Htuber v. Lockwood, sp. t., 15 How. 74; see Hunt v. Middlebrook, 14 How. 300), and are not affected by any statutes which come into force after that time, even though before the actual entry of judgment. (Moore v. Westervelt, and other cases supra.) Where the defendants failed to answer, it was held that the costs should be taxed according to the law existing at the time of their taxation, and the entry of judgment (Steward v. Lamoreautx, sp. t., 5 Abb. 14), but this decision is scarcely reconcilable with the cases before cited, and may therefore be doubted.,Where a cause is tried by a referee, it has been held that the costs are governed by the statute existing at the time the report was filed, and not by that existing when it was made and delivered (Torry v. Hadley, sp. t., 15 How. 357), but this decision is, we think, unsound. The right to costs is fixed when the report is made, and the successful party should not be allowed to increase his costs by delaying to file it until a new fee bill is enacted, as he did in the case cited.,Actions pending in 1848.]-There can be no doubt that the costs of proceedings taken up to July, 1851, in actions pending on July 1, 1848, were regulated by the old fee bill (Curtis v. Leavitt, 1 Abb. 118; Doty v. Brown, sp. t., 4 How. 429; Truscutt v. King, sp. t., id. 173), and accord- ing to the weight of authority, the costs of all proceedings in such actions, even since 1851, except appeals, are governed by the old law (Traver v. Kipp, 4 Abb. 358; McMasters v. Veroiw, sp. t., 1 Abb. 182; 10 How. 179;; 4 Duer, 625; Rich v. Husson, 1 id. 617), though a con- trary decision has been made, in a case (Curtis v. Leavitt, 1 Abb. 118) in which the subject did not receive very,581
Final and interlocutory costs. Costs in void proceedings. careful examination, the principal discussion being on another point.,ART. 3.-Final and interlocttory eosts. The distinction between final and interlocutory costs is important, inasmuch as there is a material difference between the times and modes of collecting them. (See p)ost, chaps. esvi. and cxxii.,Interlocutory costs are those which are allowed on special motion, on which an order is granted which de- cides some intervening matter relating to the cause, but not the cause itself. (M1ora v. Sun Ins. Co., sp. t., 13 Abb. 304; 22 How. 60.) All other costs are final costs, to be collected mnder and with the judgment in the action. (Ib.),Costs on a motion granting judgment for the frivolous- ness of a demurrer, are final, and not interlocutory costs (Wesley v. Bennett, sp. t., 6 Abb. 12), and this though the order grants leave to the party in fault to amend, of which leave he has not availed himself. (Ib.) So are costs on a demurrer to part of a pleading. (Mora v. Sun Ins. Co., supra; Palmer v. Smledly, sp. t., id. 185.),AuT. 4.-Costsg in void proceedigls. Actions of wlich the court has no jurisdiction.]--There is much division of opinion as to the allowance of costs on the dismissal of an action for want of jurisdiction, The New York Superior Court holds that the defendant is entitled to costs in such cases. (MTMahon v. Mutual Ben. Liss Ins. Co, 8 Abb. 297; 3 Bosw. 644; see Hunt v. Hanover, 8 Mete. 343.) So does the Supreme Court, in the second district (King v. Poole, 36 Barb. 242), and in the first district. (Culmberland C oa . v. Hoffman Coal Co., 39 Barb. 16 ; 15 Abb. 78; see also M'3Mafhko v. Mut. &c. Ins. Co, 12 Abb. 28.) The contrary has, however, been ruled in other courts or districts. (Harriott v. New Jersey R. B., sp. t., 8 Abb. 284; Gorslley v. M'Intosh, 22 Barb. 271.) 582
Costs in void proceedings. Title in question. TUnauthorized pleading.]-A pleading unauthorized by the Code (e. g., a demurrer to an answer consisting of mere denials) being a mere nullity (Richtmeyer v. Haskins, 9 How. 481), raises no issue, and no costs can be taxed for a trial had thereon. (Sleight v. Hancox, sp. t., 5 Abb. 245.) We think, however, that costs could be allowed on a motion to set aside such a demurrer, as the court would have jurisdiction of the action generally, and could pro- perly grant such a motion. (See Robinson v. Judd, sp. t., 9 How. 383.),CIAPTER CL COSTS ON JUDGMENT. ARTICLE 1. Costs in actions in which the title of land is in question.,2. Costs in actions for chattels. 3.

Full costs are allowed as of course to the successful party on a recovery in an action for the possession of real property, or when a claim of title to real property arises upon the pleadings, or is certified by the court to have come in question at the trial. (Code, % 304, 305.),What is a question of 'title.]-A question as to whether certain fixtures became part of the realty or not, is not a

Nor is a question, inci- dentally arising, as to whether a third party owned any land, a question of title within the meaning of these pro- visions. (Ib.) Thus, where a party being charged with falsely representing A. to own land, alleges or proves that A. did own the land, this is not a question of title carry- ing costs. (lb.),No question of title arises in an action upon a breach of an agreement to convey lands, where the only issue raised is whether there was an incumbrance, e. g., a right of dower, resting upon the land. (Smith v. Riggs, 2 Duer, 622.),Clani mnust be dispulted.]-A claim of title, within the meaning of this provision, is one which is in controversy between the parties, and not a claim which is conceded to be just. (O'Reilly v. Davis, 4 Sands. 722; Wicekbam v. Seely, 18 Wend. 649.*) And it must be the subject of a material issue. (Rathbone v. MeUConwell, 21 N. Y. 466.),Plaintiff must be successful on this issue.]-Notwith- standing the plaintiff may recover a verdict in the action, yet if lie fails on the issue of title, he does not establish his right to costs under this particular provision. (Squires v. Sewiard, 16 How. 478; Burhlans v. Tibbits, 7 How. 74.),Question of title on the pleadings.]-An action in which an issue upon title is immaterial, is not within this pro- vision, even though title is alleged in the complaint and denied in the answer. There must be a real issue upon the question. (Rathlbone v. McConnell, 21 N. Y. 466; aff'g S. 0., 20 Barb. 311.) An issue upon the mere fact of possession is not an issue upon title. (Ib.; Elle v. Quack- enboss, 6 Hill, 537.),* Snyder v. Beyer (3 E. D. Smith, 235), appears to be to the contrary, but if so, it is not authority. 584
Where title is in question. Questions of title on tlhe phlinLgs, A claim of title to growing trees or shrubs raises an issue of title to real property. (Powell v. Rust, 8 Barb. 567; Code Rep. [N. S.] 172.) In an action for trespass upon land, possession by the plaintiff being sufficient to enable him to maintain the action, title is not a material issue upon the pleadings (Rathbone v. .VPConnell, supra; Squires v. Seward, 16 How. 478; Brown v. Majors, 7 Wend. 495), unless the defendant sets up title in himself (Powell v. Rust, 8 Barb. 567; Code Rep. [I. S.] 172; see Rathbone v. sP Cownell, supra), or in some one under whom he claims (see ltadley v. Brice, 6 Wend. 539), even though the complaint alleges the plain- tiff's title and does not allege his possession, and the answer contains a general denial (Squires v. Seward, 16 How. 478), for it will not be inferred from such pleadings that the plaintiff was not in possession. (lb.) If, however, it appears upon the face of the pleadings that the plain- tiff was not in possession, the actual title is in question if title is denied (Niles v. Lindsley, 1 Duer, 610; 8 How. 131;* Hubbell v. Rochester, 8 Cow. 115; see Dunclcel v. Farley, sp. t., 1 How. 180), but not if admitted by the answer. (Wickhaml v. Seely, 18 Wend. 649.) A defense of leave and license does not raise an issue of title (ltathbone v. M'Connell, 21 N. Y. 466; aff'g S. C., 20 Barb. 311; Launitz v. Barnum, 4 Sands. 637; O'Reilly v. Daries, ( Sands. 722; Muller v. Bayard, sp. t., 15 Abb 449; WViekhacm v. Seely, 18 Wend. 649; People v. N. Y. Corn. Pl., id. 579; Chandler v. Duane, 10 id. 563; Otis v. Hall, 3 Johns. 450; Ezxp. Coburn, 1 Cow. 568), even though it is alleged that such license was "granted" (Rathbone v. MaConnell, supra), unless it appears that a grant under seal was made (see ib.), nor, if the grant of such an ease- ment as a right to divert water is alleged, unless some estate is shown to exist in the defendant, to which such,* As explained, 16 How. 479. 74,585

But a claim to an casement by prescription or grant, in the strict sense of the word, raises a question of title, if disputed. This was the rule under the Revised Statutes and earlier laws (Tunnicliff v. Lawyer, 3 Cow. 382; Eustace v. Tuthill, 2 Johns. 185; leaton v. Ferris, 1 id. 146; see Radley v. Brice, 6 Wend. 539), and the Code, though not so explicit, should be construed to the same effect. (Semble, Rath- bone v. SI.Conne7l, 21 N. Y. 468.) A claim to a right of way, therefore by prescription or grant, is a claim ot title (Striker v. Mott, 6 Wend. 465), even if the way claimed is a public highway (Dinehart v. Wells, 2 Barb. 432; Rand- all v. Crandall, 6 Hill, 342; Whiting v. Dudley, 19 Wend. 373), and so is a claim to common of estovers under a lease. (Rul77ey v. Brice, 6 Wend. 539.),In an action upon injuries inflicted by defendant's dog, an answer that the dog was at the time in the defendant's premises, and that the plaintiff had no right to be there, does not raise an issue of title. (Pierret v. Moler, 3 E. D. Smith, 574.),In an action for waste, where judgment for the forfeit- ure of the premises is demanded, the plaintiff's title is material. (Snyder v. Beyer, 3 E. D. Smith, 235.),The defendant cannot evade his liability for costs, by admitting the plaintiff's title on the trial, after having denied it in his answer. (Niles v. Lindsley, 1 Duer, 610; 8 How. 131; DuncEel v. Farley, sp. t., 1 How. 180; Hub- bell v. Rochester, 8 Cow. 115.),Question of title at the trial.]-The plaintiff's title may be put in issue at the trial, though not appealing to be so by the pleadings, as for example, where he alleges pos- session, and this being denied, and he not being actually in possession, he is obliged to prove title.,The plaintiff will not gain any advantage in regard to costs, by giving evidence of his title on the trial, if it has,e 586

When costs are claimed on this ground, a certificate must be procured from the judge or referee who tried the cause, of the fact that title was in issue, and that the plain- tiff proved his title. (Code, Â§ 304; see Squires v. Seward, 16 How. 478.) No other evidence of this fact can be received (Niles v. Lindsley, 1 Duer, 610; 8 How. 131), and the certificate is conclusive on the taxation of costs (SItiimford ads. Withey, 1 Wend. 279; see Barney v. Keith, 6 Wend. 555), although it may be set aside, if incorrect, on a direct motion for that purpose. (Barney v. Keith, 6 Wend. 555.) The certificate may be granted at any time iefore final judgment (FWoolley v. Whitby, 2 Barn. & Cr. 580; 4 Dowl. & Ryl. 147; Johnson v. Stanton, 2 B. & C. 621; 4 D. & R. 156; see Saratoga &c. R. R. v. M'Coy, sp. t., 9 How. 339), even after the taxation of costs. (Foxall v. Banks, 5 Barn. & Aid. 536.) But it must be granted by the court and not by the judge out of court. There appears to be no way of compelling a judge to grant a certificate of this character. He cannot be com- pelled to do so by mandamus. (Judges of Oneida C. P. v People, 18 Wend. 79.),AET. 2.-Costs in actions for chattels. Costs are allowed to the successful party as of course on a recovery in an action for the possession of personal property. (Code, Â§ 304, 305.) But if the plaintiff recovers less than fifty dollars dam- ages in such an action, he can recover no more costs (in- cluding disbursements, see p. 580), than damages, unless he recovers property, or the possession of property is ad- judged to him, the value of which, as assessed by the jury, court, or referee, by whom the action is tried, amounts, with the damages, to fifty dollars. (Code, Â§ 304.) The,587
Costs in actions for chattels. In actions for personal injuries. damages only, and not the value of the property, are to be the measure of costs in such a case. Thus, if the plain. tiff recovers property worth $25, and only six cents dam- ages, he can recover only six cents costs. (Min1;s v. Wolf, sp. t., 8 How. 238.) This rule no longer works the hard- ship complained of in Minks v. Wolf (supra), as an action can be brought in a justice's court for chattels worth $100 or less.,An action in which (1) the plaintiff demands an injuinc tion to prevent the defendant from interfering with chat. tels, and (2) damages for past interference, but in which it is admitted that the plaintiff was at the commencement of the action in possession of the property, is not an action for personal property. (Ashley v. Marslull, 30 Barb. 426; 9 Abb. 361; 19 How. 110.),ART. 3.-Costs in actions for personal injuries. Costs are allowed as of course to the successful party in an action for assault, battery, false imprisonment, ma- licious prosecution, libel, slander, criminal conversation, or seduction (Code, Â§ 304, 305.) But if the plaintiff in any such action recovers less than $50 damages, he can recover no more costs (Code, Â§ 304), including disburse- ments (Stone v. Dtqfy, 3 Sands. 761; Code Rep. N. S. 129; W7eeler v. Westgate, 4 How. 269; Belding v. Conklin, sp. t., id. 196),* than damages.,Actions in the city of New TYrk.]-In actions of this character, prosecuted in the city of New York, if the plain- tiff does not claim more than $500 damages, he can recover no more costs than are allowed in the Marine Court, nor more costs than damages. (Laws 1853, 1165, cli. 617.),The amount of the claim, and not of the recovery, is the criterion whether an action is within this statute or,* Overruling Newton v. Sweet (sp. t., 4 How. 134; 2 Code Rep. 61); /hylor v. Gardner (sp. t., 4 How. 67). 588
not. (Murray v. De Gross, 3 Duer, 668; 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 311.) And it applies only to actions commenced in the city of New York, and not to actions which are trans- ferred thither from another county (Sleight v. Hancox, sp. t., 4 Abb. 245), though we apprehend that an action which was improperly commenced in another county, for the purpose of avoiding the statute, would be held within its scope. ART. 4.-Costs in actions of which justices of the peace,have no jurisdiction. In actions of which a court of a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction, the successful party is entitled to costs as of course. (Cdde, Â§ 304, 305.) Until 1862, this clause of Â§ 304 was restricted to the actions specified by Â§ 54 of the Code. It was found that this restriction worked some injustice, inasmuch as there were some actions for the recovery of money, of which a justice had no jurisdiction, and which could not be brought in a court of record without the plaintiff incurring the risk of having to pay costs, in case he recovered less than $50 damages. (See Worden v. Brown, sp. t., 14 How. 327; Laughran v. Orser, 15 How. 281.) In 1862, this restric- tion was abrogated, without sufficiently guarding the language used, and, as the Code now stands, it seems to us difficult to avoid the conclusion that costs are a aatter of right to the successful party in every action of which a justice has no jurisdiction, including all actions in which special relief is demanded, and in which hitherto costs have beenin the discretion of the court, and all actions in which more than $200 is claimed, whatever may be really due, unless founded upon a bond for the payment of a sum not exceeding $200, a surety bond taken by a justice, for any amount, or a judg- ment of a justice, or of an inferior court in a city. It was plainly intimated, before the amendment of,COSTS ON JUDGMENT.,589
In actions of Iwhich a justice has no jurisdiction. 1862, that it would, if made, have the effect which we attribute to it. (See Laughran v. Orser, 15 How. 284.),While our views as to the effect of the Code as it now stands are as above stated, we shall not construct our work upon this basis, for the reasons that the legislature will unquestionably change the law, as soon as this oversight is brought to its notice, so as to confine the absolute right to costs to actions for the recovery of money only; and that meanwhile the courts will be disposed to strain the construction of the statute, so as to avoid, if possible, giving it this effect; as it was undoubtedly not contem. plated by the legislature.,The actions of which a justice has jurisdiction, are de- fined in i 53 and 54 of the Code. He has no jurisdiction which is not expressly conferred'upon him by statute. (lVorden v. Brown, sp. t., 14 How. 327.),The principal questions which have arisen concerning this class of actions, have been in regard to cases of mutual accounts exceeding in the aggregate $400, which are excluded from the jurisdiction of justices' courts. (Code, Â§ 54.) When such mutual accounts are proved on the trial, the plaintiff is entitled to costs, if he recovers any amount, however small. (Stilwell v. Staples, 3 Abb. 365.) And the admission of such matters of account at the trial, by the defendant, is proof thereof, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to costs in such a case. (Ib.) Such accounts, however, must consist of actual delllands on each side, for which either could sue. (Brady v. Dur'brotr, 2 E. 1). Smith, 78.) Mere payments on account of indebt- edness are not items of account within this rule. (Ib.; Crimn v. CronkItite, sp. t., 15 How. 250; lloodless v. Brutd- age, sp. t., 8 id. 263; Mills v. N. Y. Corn. Pl., 10 Wend 557 n.),An action claiming damages and forfeiture for waste, is not within a justice's jurisdiction. (Snyder v. Beyer, 3 E. D. Smith, 235.) 590
591 Action transferred from justice's court. In actions for money only. Action transferred from justices court.]--hen an action is transferred from a justice's court to the Supreme Court on a plea of title, the plaintiff is entitled to costs if a ver- dict is rendered, and the judge does not certify that title to land was in question at the trial; and this, even though the verdict was for the defendant. (Code, Â§ 61; Blake v. James, sp. t., 19 How. 321.),ART. !5.-Costs in actions for ioney only. In an action for the recovery of money (Code, Â§ 304), that is, an action in which the complaint demands judg- ment for money only (Buchanan v. Morrell, 13 How. 296), if the plaintiff recovers $50, he is entitled to costs as of course (Code, Â§ 304), but if lie does not recover so much, and the action is not one of those specified in the previous articles of this chapter, the defendant is entitled to costs. (Code, Â§ 305; Pect v. W]arth, 1 Bosw. 653; Trist v. Pirsson, 1 Hilt. 292; aff'g S. C., 3 Abb. 84; Landsbrerger v. Magnetic Telegraph Co., sp. t., 8 Abb. 33), and the plaintiff cannot recover even his disbursements. (Peet v. lirarth, 1 Bosw. 653.) The lfct that the plaintiff extinguishes a counterclaim exceeding $50, does not entitle him to costs, if lle loes not recover more than S50 clear. (Crane v. lolcolmb, 2 Hilt. 269; aff'g S. C., 8 Abb. 35 n.; overruling Kalt v. Ligot, 3 Abb. 33, 190.) Neither does it make any difference that the judgment is entered upon an offer of the defendant to allow judg- ment to be taken against hliln for a sumn less than $50, tcith costs. (.Johnson v. Saa!(r, sp. t., 10 How. 552.) In estimating the amoulnt of the plailitiff's recovery for thepurpose of determining his right to costs, the damages asessesl are alone to be taken into account. (Van Hlorne r. Petrie, 2 Cai. 213.) Thus, if a sheriff's jmry assess the plaintiff's ldamages at $49.99, and his costs at six cents, in an action within the scope of this article, tlhe defendant recovers full costs. (lb.)
Unnecessary. actions. Costs on separate issues. Several defendants. The defendant is, of course, entitled to costs if the action is decided in his favor. (Code, Â§ 305.),Unnecessary actions.]-When several actions are brought on a single written instrument, or in any other case, for the same cause of action, against several parties who might have been joined as defendants in one action, and who have been openly within the state, the plaintiff can, when entitled to costs at all, recover full costs in one action only, to be selected by him; and in the other actions he can recover only his disbursements. (Code, Â§ 304.),ART. 6.-Costs on separate issues. Where there are several distinct causes of action.stated in the complaint, on some of which the plaintiff, and on the others the defendant succeeds, each party is entitled to costs, if the action is one in which costs are a matter of right. (Semble, Dresser v. Wickes, sp. t., 2 Abb. 460.),Seceral dfenldants.]-In all actions, whether legal or equitable, for ordinary or special relief (Wiilklow v. Bell, 18 How. 397; Bank of Attica v. Wolf, 18 How. 102; Williainms v. Horgan, 13 How. 138; see _Butler v. 3Morris, 1 Bosw. 329), where there are several defendants, not united in interest, and making separate defenses by sepaate an- swers, and the plaintiff fails to recover judgment against all, the court may award costs to such defendants as have judgment iae their favor, or any of them. (Code, Â§ 306.),In such cases, it is in the discretion of the court to grant or refiise costs (Wilklow v. Bell, and other cases, supra), and such defendants cannot tax their costs as of course. (Ib.*),* Of the cases to the contrary Decker v. Gardiner (8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 29), Daniels v. Lyon (9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 549), Stone v. Duffy (3 Sands. 761, Code Rep. N. S. 129), Iinds v. Myers (4 How. 356, 3 Code Rep. 48), were decided under the Code of 1849; while Broon v. Bowen (sp. t., 16 How. 544), and Cuyler v. Coats (10 How. 141), were decided on the authority of those cases, without considering the amendment of 1851. _I _ 592
On separate issues. Several defendants. Separate bills of costs. The court may, in such case, allow only one bill of costs to all the defendants, or a separate bill to each or some of them, in its discretion. (Harper v. Chanmberlain, sp. t., 14 Abb. 408.) Where the defendants are, however, not united in inter- est, or being so united, do not answer separately, or do not set up separate defenses, costs are a matter of course to such of them as succeed in an action for ordinary relief. (Zink v. Attenbutrg, 18 How, 108; Daniels v. Lyon, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 549; Decker v. Gardiner, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 29; Corbett v. Ward, 3 Bosw. 632.) Separate bills of costs.]-Any number of defendants, appearing by one attorney and succeeding in the action, though putting in separate answers, can recover only one bill of costs (Castellanos v. Beanville, 2 Sands. 670; Braden v.iKattaiser, 3 id. 760; Tracy v. Stone, sp.t., 5 How. 104; 3 Code Rep. 73), unless separate defenses are necessarily put in, in which case they should be allowed the costs of their several answers in addition to one general bill of costs (Walker v..Russell, sp. t., 16 How. 91; 7 Abb. 452 n.), but not unless such separate answers are really necessary. (Hall v. Lindo, sp. t., 8 Abb. 341.) So, if they appear by attorneys who are partners (Crofts v. Rockefeller, sp. t., 6 How. 9; Code Rep. N. S. 177; see Brockhway v. Jeiwett, 16 Barb. 590), or if one of their attor- neys is clerk to the other (Perry v. Livingston, 6 How. 404), or if they collusively employ different attorneys for the mere purpose of increasing costs (Slater Bank v. Sturdy, 15 Abb. 75), the rule is the same. Where the defendants appear by separate attorneys, in good faith, and put in separate defenses, each is entitled to a distinct bill of costs. (Vilbur v. Wiltsey, 13 How. 506; Castellanos v. Beauville, 2 Sands. 670; Collomb v. Galdw'ell, sp. t., 5 How. 336; Code Rep. N. S. 41; Ten Broeck v. Paige, 6 Hill, 267.) A separate demurrer is a,75,593

Wilt- sey, supra.),If the defendants appear at first by separate attorneys, but subsequently unite in employing one attorney, they can recover only one bill of costs from the time that they ceased to employ separate attorneys. (Castellanos v. Beau. vile, 2 Sands. 670.),Costs to plaintiff.]-Where there are several defendants, the plaintiff, if entitled to costs, can only recover one bill, although the defendants separate their defenses, and appear by different attorneys. (Phipps v. Van Cott, 15 How. 110; Latham v. Bliss, 13 How. 416; Buell v. Gay, sp. t., 13 How. 31; overruling Comstock v. Halleck, 4 Sands. 671.),Where one defendant suffers default.]-Where one of several defendants, jointly liable, makes no answer to the complaint, and the others defend the action, the defend- ant in default is jointly liable with them for all the costs recovered by the plaintiff. (Catlin v. Billings, 13 How. 511; 4 Abb. 248;* Warner v. Ford, sp. t., 17 How. 54.),ART. 7.-Costs in actions for special relief. In actions for any other relief than the mere recovery of money, or the possession of real or personal property, it is clearly the intention of the Code that costs should be in the discretion of the court. (Code, Â§ 306.) And though, as we have suggested (ante, p. 589), there is much reason to doubt whether this intent has not been inadvertently nullified by the amendment of 1862, yet there can be no question that the old rule will be re- established by the legislature, if it has indeed been abro- gated. We shall therefore, treat our subject as if the,* Sp. t, but affirmed at general term (see 16 N. Y. 622). 594
In actions for special relief. When discretionary. discretion of the court in these actions remained uncon- trolledJ)y statute.,An action for the foreclosure of a mortgage, is clearly one in which costs are in the discretion of the court. (O'Hara v. Brophy, 24 How. 379; Bartow v. Cleveland, 7 Abb. 339; 16 How. 364; Pratt v. Ralsdell, sp. t., 7 Abb. 310 n.; 16 How. 59.) And notwithstanding a dictumn to the contrary (PtGocwan v. Morrow, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 9), we are decidedly of opinion that costs in actions for par- tition are entirely within the discretion of the court, umaffected by the provisions of tile Revised Statutes. (3 IR. . (th7 ed.) 616; [2 id. 328, Â§ 72].),It has been said, by high authority, that costs are in the discretion of the court in all actions in which more than one species of relief is demanded, even though each species is included within Â§ 304 of the Code, as for ex- ample, where money and also the recovery of specific property are demanded in one action. (Calioon v. Bank of Utica, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 492.) This is a doctrine, however, in whicl we are unable to concur. It seems to us that in au action to recover property, with damages for its de- tention, costs should be as much a matter of right as if no damages were demanded. The decision cited can be sustained upon other grounds. Tle action was not an ordinary one for the possession of property. The plaintiff was justly unwilling to rely upon the ordinary machinery of the law for the recovery of his property, and, there- fore, demanded not merely judgment for its possession, but a special judgment that the defendant should be com- pelled to deliver it to him. Such an action is not within Â§ 304, and the court rightly held it to be one in which it had a discretion as to costs.,When the action is tried by a referee, the costs are in his discretion. (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211; Ludington v. Taft, 10 Barb. 447; Graves v. Blanchard, sp. t., 4 How. 300; 3 Code Rep. 25.),595
In actions for special relief. Discretion how guided. Discretion not arbitrary.]-The discretion which the court exercises in regard to costs is not arbitrary, but is guided by a general view of the equities of each particu- lar case. (2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 322; Thrall v. Chittenden, 31 Vt. 183; Eastburn v. Kirk, 2 Johns. Oh. 317.) The dis. position of costs, in this class of cases, was, therefore, reviewed on appeal frog chancery (see Johnson v. Taber, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 319), and is still reviewable to a limited extent.,General rules.]-As a general rule, the successful party is prina facie entitled to costs (Thrall v. Chittenden, 31 Vt. 183; Hamlpson v. Bradmwood, 1 Madd. 394; Saunders v. Frost, 5 Pick. 260, 272; Vanconler v. Bliss, 11 Ves. 458), especially against a party whose conduct has been clearly wrongful. (Spencer v. Spencer, 11 Paige, 308.) And it lies upon the unsuccessful party, in every case, to show special reasons why he should not pay costs. (Vancouver v. Bliss, 11 Ves. 458.),Where both plaintiff and defendant are in fault, no costs will be allowed to either (Johnson v. Taber, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 319; Scott v. Thorp, 4 Edw. 1; Bcac7amn v. Ec7- ford, 2 Sands Ch. 116, 133; Nerwal1 v. Smith7, 1 Jac. & W. 263; Saunders v. Frost, 5 Pick. 274), and so, where the court refuses to protect a plaintiff against a wrongful act of the defendant, on the ground that the plaintiff is de- frauding the public in the matters concerning which the action is brought. (Fetridge v. Wells, sp. t., 4 Abb. 144; 13 How. 385.) And where both parties have been equally foolish or imprudent, even though not actually blameable, costs are refused. (Hitchcock v. Giddings, 4 Price, 135; Dan. 1.),On this principle, no costs are allowed where both par- ties claim too much from each other (Spencer v. Spencer, 11 Paige, 309; Caldwell v. Leiber, 7 id. 483; Brown v. Rickets, 4 Johns. Ch. 303; Brineker7off v. Lansing, id. 79; Righter v. Stall, 3 Sands. Ch. 608; Ten Eyck v. Holmes, 596

[6 Seld.] 319), nor where the party who would otherwise be entitled to costs, sets up claims to which he is not entitled (Powell v. Murray, 10 Paige, 256), except when the matter in controversy is a mere money claim, in which case the party who establishes his right to a substantial payment from the other, should be allowed his costs, deducting such as were plainly incurred in re- sisting his unfounded claims. (Hunm v. Norton, Hopk. 344.),Where the matter in suit had been submitted to arbi- tration, and an award made, which varied but little from the judgment of the court, costs were refused, though the award had not been pleaded as a bar. (Freeland v. Man- ia7ian, Hopk. 276.) When two or more actions are brought, where one would have sufficed, the plaintiff can have costs in one only, though successful in all. (Wilde v. .Jenkins, 4 Paige, 500; see Vendell v. Wendell, 3 Paige, 509.) No costs are allowed to a successful plaintiff in an action, the object of which could have been as well at- tained by a simple application on petition or affidavit. (Do La Vergne v. Evertson, 1 Paige, 181; see Tyrrell v. Hassard, Flan. & . 6 25.) In cases of such difficulty as to justify both parties in submitting their controversy to the court, it is proper to leave each party to pay his own costs (Pattison v. Hull, 9 Cow. 778; Thorpe v. Freer, 4 Madd. 466; Staines v. Morris, 1 Ves. & B. 8, 16; Dommett v. Bedford, 3 Ves. 149; White v. Foljaonbe, 11 Ves. 337; as explained in Vancouver v. Bliss, id. 458), especially if the unsuccessful party has been misled by the dicta of a succession of judges (Perry v. Whitehead, 6 Ves. 548), or by an erroneous decision of a co-ordinate tribunal. See these principles further ap- plied, post, chap. cii. Where a transaction was of so suspicious a nature as to make it reasonable that it should be investigated, the party by whose fault it assumed this suspicious character,597
In actions for special relief. When not allowed. ought not to have costs, even though the transaction is sustained. (De Monltmorency v. Devrereaux, 7 Clark & Fin. 188; 2 Dr. & Wal. 410; Fyler v. Fyler, 3 Beav. 550.),Where an objection might be taken by demurrer, the additional costs resulting from delaying it until the trial on the merits, will not be allowed to the party raising it. (Shawi v. Coster, 8 Paige, 339; IMurray v. Graham, 6 Paige, 622; !Iolligszworlh v. Shakeshaft, 14 Bcav. 492; Anon., 3 Madd. 62 n.; see Sanders v. Benson, 4 Beav. 350.),And so, where the trial is postponed for want of neces- sary parties to the action, if the defect of such parties was not set up by demurrer or answer, no costs arc allowed on the postponement. (Cotrt v. Jeffrey, 1 Sim. & Stu. 105; Mfitchell v. Bailey, 3 Madd. 61; see Shaver v. Brainard, 29 Barb. 25; Price v. Berrington, 2 Bear. 285.),A defendant in an action for special relief, who allows judgment to be taken against him by default, will not be made liable for the costs incurred by the admission of a new defendant to plead, without consulting him, and by the litigation consequent thereon. (Eagleson v. Clark, 2 E. D. Smith, 644; 2 Abb. 364.),Though it has been said, in broad terms, that costs can never be given to the party who fails in the action (Thorpe v. Freer, 4 Madd. 466), this is not an absolute rule; for the successful party has been sometimes charged with costs, when the proceedings of the other party have been induced by the erroneous statements of the former* (Fielder v. Higginlson, 3 Ves. & B. 142; see Harrison v. Coppard, 2 Cox, 318), and when relief is granted against a hard bargain, as unconscionable, though not fraudulent, it is usually granted only upon payment of costs (Bowes v. Heaps, 3 Ves. & B. 117; Gowland v. De Faria, 17 Ves. 20; Evans v. Peacock, 16 id. 512; Gwynne v. Heaton, 1 Bro. C. C. 1; Twisleton v. Grifith, 1 P. Wins. 310), though,* At any rate costs should be denied to the successful party in such case. (Fenton v. Browne, 14 Ves. 144.) 598
In actions for special relief. When allowed. Creditor's action. in one such case, no costs were allowed (Lawcley v. Hooper, 3 Atk. 278), and in another, costs were awarded to the plaintiff. (Barnardiston v. Lingood, 2 Atk. 133.) So in an action to redeem from a mortgage, the plaintiff has usually to pay cos1 s, as will be hereafter seen. So in an action brought to declare a purchaser only an incumnbran- cer, the plaintiff, though successful, was required to pay costs. (Long v. Clinton, 2 Moll. 455.),A defendant, who is made a party without necessity, having been willing to do justice without a suit, should be allowed costs. (Stafford v. MJott, 3 Paige, 100; Bennett v. At7ins, 1 You. & C. Exch. 247.) And though he may -have refused once to do equity, yet if he recants such refusal, and uses due diligence to bring his offer of justice to the knowledge of the plaintiff, before the action is commenced, no costs will be allowed against him. (Mill ington v. Fox, 3 Myl. & Cr. 338.),Creditor's action.]-If the object of a creditor's action entirely fails, the plaintiff will be charged with costs (Raymondl v. Reafield, 2 Edw. Ch. 196), unless the action clearly appears to have been brought in good faith, and upon circumstances justifying a suspicion of the good faith of the defendants. And where a mere "fishing bill" has been brought and dismissed, the debtor's costs will not be set off against the judgment. (Evans v. Vance, sp. t., 2 Barb. 598.),If an action of this nature is brought to accomplish only such purposes as might be as well effected by means of ordinary proceedings supplementary to execution, no costs should be allowed to the plaintiff, even if successful.,In chancery, when a proper case appeared for charging one of several defendants with the whole costs of the suit, it was usual to direct the plaintiff to pay the costs of the other defendants, and to recover the whole, with his own, from the defendant in fault (Jones v. Levis, 1 Cox, 199; see Parkes v. White, 11 Ves. 238; Weylawuth v. Boyer, 1,599
In actions for special relief. Demurrer. Divorce. Dower. id. 426), but this complicated proceeding is not necessary under our present practice, as judgment may be reldetred in favor of one defendant against another.,Demurrer.] -Costs should always be allowed to the party succeeding on a demurrer. (Utica Mfg. Co. v. Sup'rs of Oneida, 1 Barb. Ch. R. 445; Gregory v. Reeve, 5 Johls. Oh. 232), unless for very special reasons to the contrary. (Ib.),Divorce.]-Upon a judgment of divorce in favor of a wife, she should be allowed costs (Graves v. Graves, 2 Paige, 62; Germond v. Germond, 1 id. 83), but upon a similar judgment in favor of the husband, even for adul- tery, no costs are allowed, if the wife has no separate property. (De Rose v. De Rose, Hopk. 100.),Upon a recovery by the wife, such sums as have been paid to her by the husband in the course of the suit, for defraying its expenses, should be set off against her necessary counsel fees and expenses not strictly taxable, and the surplus, if any, deducted from her taxed costs. (Kendall v. Kendall, 1 Barb. Ch. It. 610.),Where no answer is put in, the defendant cannot recover costs, notwithstanding, that, on the subsequent reference of the cause, the plaintiff fails to prove his case. (Perry v. Perry, 2 Barb. Oh. I. 285.),Dower.]-In an action for dower, the plaintiff, if suc- cessful, should be allowed costs, in case she has demanded her dower of the defendant before suit, and been refused it (Worgan v. Ryder, 1 Ves. & B. 20), but not otherwise. (Code, Â§ 307; Russell v. Austin, 1 Paige, 192; Hale v. James, 6 Johns. Oh. 258; Hazen v. Thurber, 4 Johns. Ch. 604.) The fact that in negotiations for the purpose of valuing the plaintiff's dower, and settling her claim by the payment of its value, the defendant refused to pay as much as it was really worth, is not equivalent to a refusal to assign dower. (Hale v. James, supra.) 600
In actions for special relief. Dowor. Fraud. So where a widow is a party defendant, her dower should be assigned to her without costs against her. (Bawley v. Bradford, 9 Paige, 200; Church v. Church, 3 Sands. lh. 434.) Fraud.l--An unsuccessful party, who has acted fraud- ulently with reference to the subject of the suit, should be charged with costs (see Prentice v. Achorn, 2 Paigc, 30; Bushnell v. Harford, 4 Johns. Ch. 301), but not where lie is charged only with constructive fraud. (Murray v. Ballou, 1 Johns. Oh. 566.) Where a successful party has made unfounded charges of fraud against his opponent, he will be denied costs (Moore v. Moore, 2 Moll. 455; Cu2linvgworth v. Loyd, 2 Beav. 385; see Brinxcccrhoff v. Lansing, 4 Johns. Ch. 79; aty v. Van Hook, sp. t., 9 How. 427), or if allowed his general costs, will be required to pay the costs incurred by his opponent in disproving the charges of fraud. (Wright v. Hloward, 1 Sim. & Stu. 205.) This rule, how- ever, does not apply to a case in which fraud was charged only in the complaint, and no notice taken of it at the trial, either to prove or disprove it. (Staniland v. Willott, 3 Macn. & G. 664; 12 E. L. & E. 42.) And unfounded charges of fraud are good cause for charging an unsuc- cessful party with costs (Shedden v. Patrick, 1 Macq. 535; Scott v. Dun1bar, 1 Moll. 442; Ex parte Taylor, 4 Deac. & Ch. 125; Langley v. Fisher, 9 lBeav. 90), unless the suc- cessful party has been put to no trouble or expense in disproving them (Staniland v. Willott, 3 Macn. & G. 664), or unless the conduct of the adverse party was suspicious (Hlarkey v. Harkey, 1 Ired. Eq. 394; De Montmorency v. Devereaux, 7 Clark & Fin. 188; 2 Dr. & Wal. 410; Pyler v. Pyler, 3 Beav. 550), or unless the pleader has made such charges in good faith, and without adequate means of knowing their falsity. (Wade v. Dick, 1 Ired. Eq. 313.),76,601
In actions for special relief. Interpleader. Mortgage cases. Interpletader.]-Where an action of interpleader is pro. perly brought, it is almost a matter of course to allow the plaintiff his costs out of the fund (Atkinson v. Manks, 1 Cow. 691; Thomisont v. Ebbets, Hopk. 272; Canfield v. Mlorgan, id. 224; Aymer v. Gault, 2 Paige, 284), and not only his costs in that action, but also those which he has incurred in any action at law brought against him by the defendants in relation to the property in question (Miller v. Watts, 4 Duer, 203; S. C. 1 Abb. 234; Richards v. Salter, 6 Johns. Ch. 445), charging them ultimately to the party whose claim proves to be unjust (Thomson v. Ibbets, Hopk. 272; see Badean v. Rogers, 2 Paige, 209), and it makes no difference that the party in fault is not within the jurisdiction of the court. (Canfield v. M1organ, Hoplk 224.),But the plaintiff is not allowed costs if the action was unnecessary (Badcau v. Rogers, 2 Paige, 209; Bedell v. Hoffman, id. 199), as where the whole object of the action could be attained by a simple application under Â§ 122 of the Code. (Badeau v. Rogers. 2 Paige, 209.),Mllortgage cases.]-A mortgagee is in general allowed his costs, whether as a plaintiff in an action of foreclosure (see Bartle v. Wilkin, 8 Sim. 238), or as a defendant in an action to redeem (Be- edict v. Gilman, 4 Paige, 58; Detillinl v. Gale, 7 Ves. 584; Loflus v. Sivift, 2 Sch. & Les. 657; Wethercll v. Collins, 3 Madd. 255; see Broc7- wa.y v. Wells, 1 Paige, 617; Slec v. Manhattan Co., id. 81; Van Buren v. Olistead, 5 id. 13; Vroom v. Ditmas, 4 id. 535), and this notwithstanding he claims more than is due. (Loftuts v. Swift, supra.) And costs are in like man- ner allowed to all persons claiming under him, and necessarily made parties to such action. (Wetherell v. Collins, 3 Madd. 255.),This rule is, however, confined to cases in which the mortgagee acts as such, and in a reasonable manner (Detillin v. Gale, 7 Ves. 584; Harvey v. Tebbutt, 1 Jac. & 602
In actions for special relief. Mortgages. Partition. Quieting title. W. 197), and when he has acted oppressively and unfairly, costs will be denied him. (Ib.; Yroon v. Ditmas, 4 Paige, 535; Van Buren v. Olnstead, 5 Paige, 9; Morony v. O'Dea, 1 Ball & B. 121; Rider v. Jones, 2 You. & Coll. C. C. 329.) And if the mortgage has been actually satisfied before the action to redeem is commenced (Calkins v. Isbell, 20 N. Y. 147; Wilson v. Cluer, 4 Beav. 214), or if a tender of the amount due has been in like season made and kept good (Pratt v. Stiles, 9 Abb. 150; 17 How. 211; Roberts v. Williams, 4 Hare, 129; Shuttleivorth v. Lowther, cited 7 Ves. 586), or if the mortgagee has refused to inform the mortgagor, or those claiming under him, what amount is due, and has asserted his own absolute title to the property (Slee v. MIanli7ttat n Co., 1 Paige, 81; see lenlry v. Davis, 7 Johns. Ch. 40; affirmed, 2 Cow. 324), the mortgagee will be charged with costs. Partition.]-In actions for partition, a full bill of costs is made up for each party, and the whole amount is divided and assessed upon the various parties in} propor- tion to their respective interests in the land (Phielps v. Green, 3 Johns. Ch. 302), each party whose bill of costs exceeds the proportion assessed to him having execution for such excess against the parties whose costs were less than the proportion due from them (Tibbits v. Tibbits, 7 Paige, 204), subject. however, we presume, to a further subdivision of such executions, so that no party shall have executions out against him to a greater amount than is due from him on the whole case. Costs incurred by unnecessary proceedings in the action, as by unfounded claims (Crandall v. Jloysradt, 1 Sands. Ch. 40), or by bringing in unnecessary parties (Hamersley v. Hamnersley, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 127), must be borne exclusively by the party in fault. Quieting title.]--I an action to quiet title, on the ground that the defendant's acquiescence in improve-,603

(Do Rimener v. Castillon, 4 Johns. Ch. 85.),Spccific performance.]-Costs should not be allowed to a successful plaintiff (purchaser), in an action for specific performance, unless lie has made a demand (see Bruce v. Tilson, 25 N.Y. 194) oi performance, and tendered the pur- chase money before suit (Dustin v. Newvcomer, 8 Ohio, 49), and brought the money into court (Galloway v. Barr, 12 Ohio, 354); unless the vendor has dispensed with a tender by a positive refusal to perform, as for example, where he insists upon the terms of an agreement entered into by mistake. (Kisselbrack v. Livingston, 4 Jolms. Ch. 149.),Where the vendor sues, without having given an abstract of title, or cleared off the lien of a judgnment, he should not recover costs. (Scott v. Thorl, 4 Edw. Ch. 1.) So if the abstract delivered was not sufficient (WVilso1 v. Clapheam, 1 Jac. & W. 36), and indeed whenever the pur- chaser makes a fair objection, in good faith. (Aislabiev. iice, 3 Mladd. 256; see Thorpe v. Freer, 4 id. 466.) But a purchaser making frivolous objections (Thorpe v. Freer, supra), or persisting in an objection after being informed of a decision in favor of the title offered (Biscoc v. Wilks, 3 Meriv. 456), will be charged with costs on a judgment for specific performance.,Heirs of a party to a contract for the sale of lanil should not be charged with costs, if not personully in fault. (Dyer v. Potter, 2 Johns. Ch. 152.) And when such heirs are infants, and inherit nothing from the vendor, except the property which they are required to convey, the purchase-money having been paid to the deceased vendor, the purchaser must pay their costs. (Sutplhen v. Fowler, 9 Paige, 280.),Trustees.]-The general principle which regulates the allowance of costs in actions against trustees for an 604
In actions for special relief. Trustes. Wills. accounting or other special relief is, that they are to be allowed their costs for proceedings not made necessary by their fault (Ray v. Van Hook, sp. t., 9 How. 427; gTaringv. Crane, 2 Paige, 83), and charged with the costs of such inquiries and proceedings as are made necessary by their breach of trust. (Ray v. Van Hook, supra; Duffy v. Duncan, 32 Barb. 587.) A trustee who has misapplied the trust ful(s is charge- able with the costs of proceedings for an accounting on that point (ib.; Spencer v. Spencer, 11 Paige, 299), and this, on grounds of public policy, notwithstanding he has made estitution before the action is brought. (lay v. Van Hook, supra.) IHe is not, however, chargeable with the costs of needless inquiries, suggested by groundless fears. (Ib.) A trustee is chargeable with all the costs of litigation arising out of his gross neglect of duty (Spelcer v. Spencer, 11 Paige, 299), and one who neglects to require his co- trustee to pass his accounts according to the trust deed, will not be allowed costs. (lb.) A trustee who neglects to invest money according to his duty, will be charged with the costs of proceedings for its investment. (Powell v. Murray, 10 Paige, 256.) A trustee coming into court in good faith, to seek its direction as to any act involving him in responsibility, should always be allowed his costs. (Curtis v. Chanmler, 6 Madd. 123.) nd in general, a trustee should be allowed his costs whenever he has not acted in bad faith, or from interested motives. (rNoble v. Meymott, 14 Beav. 471.) WiPs.]-When the terms of a will are so ambiguous as to render it proper to bring an action to settle its con- struction, the costs of all the parties should be paid out of the estate (King v. Strong, 9 Paige, 94; Irving v. Dc Kay, id. 533; Rogers v. Ross, 4 Johns. Oh. 608; Milecr v. Row- a0, 5 Clark & Fin. 99; Pearson v. Pearson, 1 Sch. & Les. 12; Comn'rs of Charities v. Cotter, 1 Dr. & War. 498; Saw- yer v. Baldwin, 20 Pick. 388; Barrington v. Tristram,,605
In actions for special relief. Wills. Amouunt 6 Ves. 349; see Smith v. Smith, 4 Paige, 271); especially where such parties are infants, lunatics, or idiots, &c. (King v. Strong, supra; see Wood v. Â¥andenburg1h, 6 Paige, 277); but they should not fall exclusively upon the interest of residuary legatees, and where certain specified property is left to particular parties, and the residue to others, the costs should be apportioned among the parties, according to the value of their respective interests (Mitchell v. Blain, 5 Paige, 588.) Such costs may ver properly be charged to any fund created out of the estate for a purpose which is likely to fail, and which is tied up subject to a contingency. (King v. Strong, 9 Paige, 94.),A suit between claimants under a will, and other claimants under a deed of the testator, inconsistent therewith, is not within this rule, and the costs cannot be charged to the estate. (Irwin v. lRogers, 12 Irish Eq. 159.),ART. 9. Costs against imunicipal corporations. No costs or disbursements can be recovered against a municipal corporation, unless the claim upon which the action is founded was presented to the chief fiscal officer of such corporation, before the commencement of an action thereon. (Laws 1859, 570, ch. 262.),This provision applies to all classes of actions against such corporations, including actions for negligence. (Hart v. Brooklyn, 36 Barb. 226.),ART. 10. Amwount of costs. When costs are allowed, their amount is as herein stated.,Before notice of trial.J--The plaintiff's costs, for all proceedings up to trial, in an action in which judgment may be had, upon failure to answer, without application to the court, and in which only one defendant is served 606
Amount of costs. Before notice of trial. with process, are ten dollars (Code, Â§ 307, subd. 1),* and in other actions twenty-five dollars. (Ib.) Though the defendant should, by answering, make it necessary for the plaintiff to apply to the court for judg- ment, yet that will not entitle the latter to the higher rate of costs, if in case no answer had been served, no application to the court would have been needed. (Pardee v. Schenck, 11 How. 500 ;t Â¥Van Yalkenbur v. Van Sch7aic;, sp. t., 8 How. 271; Candlee v. Ogilvie, 5 Duer, 658; People v. Van Deusen, sp. t., 2 Code Ieep. 7; 3 How. 385. Where more than one defendant is served with process, the plaintiff is entitled to two dollars for each additional defendant so served, not exceeding ten, and to one dollar for each necessary defendant so served, above that num- ber. (Code, Â§ 307, subd. 14.) This charge can, however, be made only for service upon defendants necessarily made parties to the action (Case v. Price, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348), and a defendant does not lose his right to object to the taxation of such a charge by omit- tine to set up the excess of parties at a previous stage of , cause. (lb.) The plaintiff's right to these costs is fixed by the com- mencement of the action, if his claim is a just one, and one which would entitle him to costs on judgment. And these costs must be included in any tender or offer of judgment. (Rockeefeller v. IVeiderwax, sp. t., 3 How. 382; Burnett v. Westfall, sp. t., 15 How. 430; Keese v. IVWyan, sp. t., 8 How. 88.) The defendant's costs, in an action of either description, before notice of trial, are ten dollars. (Code, Â§ 307.) * As amended, 1864.

Amount of costs. Costs from notice to trial. Costs from notice to trial.]-For proceedings subsequent to actual and due service of notice of trial (Tillslpatug v. Dick, sp. t., 8 How. 33; Morrison v. Ide, sp. t., 4 How. 304; 3 Code Rep. 17), and before the trial occurs, fifteen dollars are allowed to the defendant, but nothing to the plaintiff. (Code, Â§ 307.*),These costs cannot be allowed against or in favor of any party as to whom the cause has not been noticed for trial (Sluytcr v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673; Tillspaugh v. Dick, sp. t., 8 How. 33), even though it has been noticed by another party. (Ib.),This charge could not therefore (when it was allowed in favor of a plaintiff) be taxed against a defendant who failed to answer (Sluyter v. Smith7, 2 Bosw. 673), nor where judgment was granted on motion for the frivolousness of the defendant's pleading, without noticing the cause for regular trial (Butchlurs' &d Drovers' Ban7k v. Jacobsoin, sp. t., 22 How. 470; Rochester City Bank v. Rapelje, 12 id. 26; and see ante, p. 424), for the hearing of such a motion is not a trial. (Ib.),Neither can it be taxed in an action in which no issue is raised (Pardee v. Shcen7k, 11 How. 500), even though a notice of trial is served (ib.), for in such case no such notice ought to be served. (Ib.),This amount can be charged only once, though the cause be noticed several times (Jac7ison v. 'APBurn1ey, sp. t., 6 How. 408; Perry v. Livingston, sp. t., 6 How. 404), or even if it is tried more than once. (J.ackett v. Judd, sp. t., 18 How. 385.),If notice of trial is served by the defendant before he is served with notice of an order for discontinuance, though after the order is granted, he is entitled to this item of costs. (Hall v. Lindo, sp. t., 8 Abb. 341.),In addition to this item, either party is allowed, for attending upon and taking the deposition of a witness,,*As amended, 18G4. 608

Trial fees. conditionally, for attending to perpetuate his testimony, for attending the examination of a party before trial, or for drawing interrogatories to annex to a commission, ten dollars for each service. (Code, Â§ 307.*),Trial fees.]-For tile trial of an issue of law, twenty dollars, and for trial of an issue of fact, thirty dollars, are allowed to either party; with ten dollars additional if the trial necessarily occupies more than two days. (Code, Â§ 307.t) This charge may be taxed by tile successful party, in every case in which an issue has been joined, and regu- larly brought to trial, and there disposed of, whether testimony is taken and a verdict rendered or not. Thus, it is allowed to a defendanlt who takes judgment by default on the plaintiff's failure to appear at the trial (Dodd v. Curry, sp. t., 4 How. 123; 2 Code Rep. 69), or where the plaintiff is nonsuited on the trial (Allaire v. Lee, 4 1)ucr, 609; 1 Abb. 125), or where the complaint is dismissed on the trial as containing no cause of action (Slb)lwnon1 v. Brower, sp. t., 2 Abb. 377), though in this last case, it seems clear to us that the fee allowed should be for the trial of an issue of law only. As there can be no trial where there is no issue joined, this charge cannot be taxed in any such case, as for example where judgment is taken on ftilure to answer (Slayter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. G73), even where, the summons being served by publication, the plaintiff is required to prove his case (Chapman v. Lemon, sp. t., 11 IIow. 235), or where the defendant admitted the plaintiff's whole claim, and set up a counterclaim, which the plaintiff did not controvert. (Pardee v. Schenek, 11 How. 500.) This fee cannot be taxed upon judgment being obtained by motion, without blrnging the cause regularly to trial, as upon the dismissal of a complaint for want of diligence * As amended, 1862-3.,77,t As amended, 1864.

Westercelt, 3 Sands 749.t) Thus, where a cause was tried by the court, and referred for the purpose of having an account taken, and the report of the referee was necessarily submitted to the court for confirmation, three trial fees were allowed (Wig- gins v. Ar7elnbltrg7t, supra), though the court could not have allowed a trial fee on the confirmation of the report, had it been unopposed. (Ib.) So where an issue of law and an issue of fact arise in the same action, a trial fee should be allowed on each. And if an issue of fact should be brought to trial, and the jury discharged for any cause, except the fault of the party finally successful, he would probably be allowed the usual fee for that trial, as well as for the one in which the cause was actually decided. (Semble, Ellsworth v. Gooding, sp. t., 8 How. 1.) * To the contrary are Pratt v. Allen (Buffalo Superior Ct:, 19 How. 450), Roberts v. Mforrison (sp. t., 7 How. 396), and Lawrence v.

Livinston, sp. t., 6 How. 404); but if the action is properly triable at the circuit, and is referred during the circuit by consent, a term fee is taxable. (Sipperly v.

Slte77on, sp. t., 1 Code IRep. 134.),And if a cause is called and passed, in consequence of the absence of the parties when it is reached, we think it cannot be considered as necessarily on the calendar thereafter. The amendment to the Code, which has sub- stituted the word "tried" for "reached," cannot af'ect this principle. It may give the successful party a right to the term fee for that term, which lie had not before (Hendricks v. Boluck, 2 tAbb. 360; 4 E. D. Smith, 461; Wltilpp7e v.

Sheldon, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 134.),A general stay of proceedings, granted before the com- mencement of the term, is not equivalent to a postpone- ment at the term for the purposes of costs. (Sliatfelt v. Power, sp. t., 13 How. 89.) The withdrawal of a cause from a term at which it is called, and its submission on written arguments to another judge, do not constitute a postponement within the meaning of 5 307. (Hager v. Dnefort7, sp. t., 8 How. 448.),When a postponement has been granted on payment of certain costs, no term fee can be taxed for that term, either by the party paying such costs (see Linacre v. Luesh, 3 Wend. 305), or by the party receiving them. (Trustees of Penn Ytn v. Ttell, sp. t., 9 How. 400.),Where the cause is noticed for two different terms at the same time, a term fee cannot be taxed for both, even though the fault lies with the unsuccessful party. (Wilson v. Al1en, sp. t., 4 How. 59; 2 Code Rep. 26.) When a cause is placed on the calendar of one term of the court, and is transferred by order of the court to another contemporaneous term, no term fee is taxable for the former term. (Comnstock v. Halleck, 4 Sands. 671.),A party by whom the cause was placed on the calendar cannot object, on the taxation of costs, that it was not necessarily there. (IIager v. Danforth, sp. t., 8 How. 448; Ec7erson v. Spoor, sp. t., 4 How. 361; 3 Code Rep. 70; but see Wilson v.

(Post v. Wcster elt, 4 Sanll.

(Bralle/ v. PFay, sp. t., 1S How. 481; .Mlerrill v. Ncmr, 7 Wend. 237.),A defendant who would otherwise be entitled to double costs loses his right thereto by joining ill one answer with another defendant who is not within the statute. (Bradley v.

Extra allowance as of right. double costs' are not now allowed, unless the defendant succeeds on the main issue.,How obtainled.]-In Mack v. 3lrcCul77oc (sp. t., 2 How. 127), it was held tlat double costs could be allowed only upon application to the court, and could not be allowed as of course by the clerk, but in I7heelock v. Iotc7lk7iss (18 I-ow. 468), a contrary doctrine is stated.,Treble costs.]-In certain cases, by special statutes which we have not thought it profitable to collate, treble costs are allowed, as for example, to officers sued for an act done under the militia laws. (1 R. S. 324.) Treble costs mean literally thrice the amount of single costs, and not single costs with seventy-five per cent added. (Walker v. Burn)tam1, sp. t., 7 How. 55; * Dl)ubarv. Jlitchl cock, 5 Taunt. 820.) In a very briefly reported case (Anon., 4 Wend. 416), it is said to have been held that " treble damages and treble costs" could not be awarded by the clerk. But while this is true of treble damages, we do not think it is trne of treble costs, assuming that double costs can be taxed by the clerk as ruled in Wheeler v. IHotchlkiss (18 I[ow. 468).,AnT. 12.-Extra allowance as of rilqht. In an action for the partition of land, for the foreclosure of a mortgage, for an adjudication upon a will or other instrument in writing, or for the determination of claims to real property, and in any action in which a warrant of attachment has been issued, the plaintiff is entitled, upon recovering judgment in his favor, to an allowance, in addition to his regular costs, of ten per cent on the first $200, five per cent on the next $200, or less, and two per cent on the next $1,000, or less (Code, Â§ 308), to be esti- * Patclhin v.

(Code, .309.) When it is necessary to apply to tile court for an order eniilrcing payment of an installienlt fhlling due after judgment in an action for foreclosure, the plaintit is entitled to the same rate of allowance, but to no more in all, tlanl if the whole amount of the mortgage had been due when judglment was entered. (Ib.),rThese allowances are undoubtedly matters of right, if tlie plaintiff is allowed final costs at all, but we very lmuc doubt whether lie has any right to tliem when the court, in the exercise of its discretion under Â§ 306 of tle Code, denies hliml general costs.,The right to these allowances extends only to those actions whilch fll strictly within the description of Â§ 308, and not to other actions of a similar nature. Thus, an action to foreclose a mechanics' lien is not within the meaning of this section (Randolph v. Foster, 3 E. D. Smith, 64-S; 4 Abl . 262), nor an action to set aside a grant of land (Bridges v. Miller, 2 ])uer, 6S3), for the " proceedings to colmpel the determination of claims," &c., mentioned in this section are only those authorized by tle IRevised Statutes, and referred to iln Â§ 41!) of the Code (ilb.; 'Powrs v. Barr, sp. t., 24 larb. 142), and so of an action to deter- mine what land should be sold under an assessment. (Pocers v. Barr, supra.),The Code does not grant an allowance on an application for surplus moneys remaining al'ter aL judgment and sale on foreclosure. (N. I. Lifi &* Trutst Co. v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 12 Abb. 458.),An action for an adjudication upon a written instru- ment, within the meaning of this provision, is one in which a trustee seeks the construction of his trust, or one brought 618

It is not every action in which the validity of an instrument is in dispute, that is within this provision. (Ib.) The class of actions intended are those whiche were formerly brought in chancLerIy ior thle interpretation of instruments. (lioFeMA, J., LewiJ. s v. Bryce, Voorh. Code, (ith ed. 43!).) An action to set aside an assignmell t as fraludulenlt on its ilee, is within this provision (ib.), but not if the assignment is attacked oni gromnds outside of itself. (Ib.) 'Thfe plaintiff cannot recover the c:. a: allo.wance for issuingt an attachment, when it has beecl vacated as im- properly granted. (Isclim v. Graydon, sp. t., 26 liow\. !5; CLERK, J. Jolnts v. B)'rotw, 3Ms.) Tlhe allowanle must be estinlited on tlhe amount of ile verdict, when that is less than tile value of the property attached (Brace v. Bealty, sp. t., 5 Abb. 221), and it l]as been held by DIAIEs, J., tlat it is to be estillated in like manner, even if no prol)erty is levied upon under the attachment (.Jacklvson v. ig(laniere, sp. t., 15 H]ow. 224), but this is, in our opinion, an error. Â§ 30!) of the Code directs that the allowance shall be estimated on tlie value of the property " claimed or attached, or affected," &c., each word clearly referring to a separate class of actions.' How applied Jfr.]-The value of property being esti- mated by the court or commissioners (Code, Â§ 30!)), these allowances can be taxed by the clerk, without an order of the court.

Difficult and extraordinary cases. been issued ),* the court may also, in its discretion, make a fu'ther allowance to any party, not exceeding five pp, cent. upon the amount of the recovery or claim, or subject matter involved. (Code, Â§ 309.),This section of the Code does not affect tile equitable power of the court to allow counsel fees to all parties out of a fund in tlhe cause (Hlotaling v. M1ars7t, 14 Abb. 161), as to which, see Art. 13, infra.,Int wihat cases.]-Thlloughl tile Code does not now in terms restrict the granting of allowances to any particu. lar class of actions, as it formerly did,t yet, by 'irecting allowances to be made at a certain percentage on the amount of the matter in controversy, it in effect gives no authority to make an allowance in any action, the subject matter of which has no pecuniary value which tile court can estimate. (People v. Flagg, 25 Barb. 652; 15 How. 36; Powers v. Barr, sp. t., 24 Barb. 142.),An allowance may be made to a defendant who recov- ers judgment solely by reason of the plaintiff having a verdict of less than S50 in his favor, and thereby losing costs. (Brad/ v. Dlrbroiw, 2 E. D. Smith, 78.) But the allowance could not, under the Code of 1849, be granted to a defendant who recovered general costs merely in con- sequence of the plaintiff's failing to recover a judgment more favorable than had been previously offered to him. (M'Lees v. Avery, sp. t., 4 How. 441.) We suppose that an allowance can be male in such a case, under the Code as it now stands, but presume that it will not be.,Difficult and extraordinary cases.]-Some of the earlier decisions held that every litigated action was more or less difficult, and that some allowance should, therefore, be,* As to what actions are included in this list, see ante, p. 618. t The cases on the construction of the Code as it formerly stood in this respect, may be found in Abbotts' Digest, COBTs, 1070-1074. 620

(See ib.) But a different view was taken by a majority of the judges, and special circumstances required( to be shown, to warrant an allowance (lox v. Gould, sp. t., 5 How. 278; Dexter v. Gardner, sp. t., id. 417; Sands v. Sands, sp. t., 6 id. 453; Gould v. C7litlpi, sp. t., 4 id. 185; Iocward v. osome &c. 1., R. Co., sp. t., id. 416; Hall v. Prentice, sp. t., 3 id. 328; Beers v.

It is not necessary that the case should be both difficult and extraordinary to warrant an allowance. (Woods v. Illinois Cent. 1B. 1. Co., sp. t.. 20 IHow. 285.) No allowance ought to be granted in an action not involving any peculiar difliculties, and in which ;an in- quest is taken, for want of an affidavit of melrits (Hall v. Prentice, sp.t., 3 How. 328), n , where the only (question of law is one of usury, and the p,;rtics, counsel and witnesses are all neilghbors, and are, therefore, not put to unusual trouble to attend, and no peculiar feature of difficulty appears (Powlers v. Wolcott, sp. t., 12 How. 565), nor where the difficulties of the case have arisen from the excessive claims or improper conduct of the successifl party. (Sands v. Sands, sp. t., 6 How. 453; Sackett v. 'all, sp. t., 4 How. 71; Fish v. Torrantce, sp. t., 5 id. 317.) The fact that the trial occupies an unusual length of time, is good ground for an allowance, as an extraordinary case. (Fort v. Good- ing, 9 Barb. 388; Howard v. -Booe & Turin P. . .

Rensselter, 4 Paige, 85.),Amounut.]-The. amount of la allowance to a plaintiff must be regulated by tle alnonit of his recovery, and not of his claim. (Wilkinson v. Tiff)lny, 4 Abb. 98; Sara- 622

An allowanlce to the defendaut may be lmade in proportion to tle amount of the plaintiff's claim (see Union Bsan, v. aMolt, 13 Abb. 247;* WVilkinson v. Titirnly, 4 id. 98), nlless in an action for taking specific property, in which case the value of the property should furnish the basis of conmptation in favor of the defendant as well as of the plaintiff. (Sara- toga & v IV . R . . Co. v. 3I'Coy, sp. t., 9) How. 33!.) In an action for special relief, e. ./., an injunction, tie value of the property directly affectcd by the result of the action may be taken as the basis of calculation. (People v. Alblay &' t R. 1t. ., 16 Abb. 465.) If the value of the Imatter in controversy llas not been duly ascertained, that objection must be raised upon the hearing of the application, or it is waived. (Dresser v. JenninIgs, sp. t., 3 Abb. 240.) When the cause lhas been twice tried, the amnount of recovery on tile new trial alone regulates an allowanco to the plaintiff (Sleight v. IIancox, sp. t., 4 Abb. 245-.) Application for (llolwance.]--Appl)ication for an allow- ance must be mad(e to tle court (Code, Â§ 309), an(d not to a judge out of court (Mann v. Ti/ler, sp. t., 6 How. -23"), except in the city of New York (Mllain v. Pope, sp. t., 16 How. 271), and to no other judge than the one who tried the cause (lite 52, Sulr)'em'e Ct.; Osborne v. Bells, sp. t., 8 How. 31; D/c7kmanl v. Ml'Donals, sp. t., id. 121; Tnl- Rensselaer v. lidd, sp. t., id. 242 ; Flint v. ltic7arldso, 1p. t., 2 Code Rep. 80), if it was tried by tile court; but if it was tried by a referee, the application must be made to the court (see Maine v. Pope, sp. t., 16 How. 271; Osborne v. Betls, sp. t., 8 How. 31; Gould v. Cthali,, sp. t., 4 1How. * In this case a new trial was afterwards ordered, which resulted in favor of the defendant again. An allowance of $1,000 was made after the new trial, by BAniNx D, J.,623
Discretionary allowance. Application for. Counsel fees. 185), in which case, it is desirable to produce a certificate from the referee that the case is a suitable one for a allowance (Fox v. Gould, sp. t., 5 How. 278; see Main v. Pope, sp. t., 16 How. 271), though this will by no means be conclusive evidence of the fact. (Gould v. Chapin, sp. t., 4 How. 185.) If it is impossible to make the motion before the judge who tried the cause, within a reasonable time, no doubt another judge may hear it. (Semble, Mann v. Tyler, sp. t., 6 How. 235.),The application may be made at the trial, without notice (Mitchell v. Hall, sp. t., 7 How. 490; see Mannl v Tyler, sp. t., 6 How. 235) or upon notice (1Man1n v. Tyler, sp. t., 6 How. 235) at a subsequent term (Saratoga & TW. R. B. Co. v. M2Coy, sp. t., 9 How. 339), and at any place at which other motions in the cause may be made. (Sprong v. Snyder, sp. t., 6 How. 11; disapproving Niver v. Bosst mlan, sp. t., 5 id. 153.),After entry of judgment, the application comes too late (Martin v. IM Cornmick, 3 Sands. 755.),AnT. 14.-Counsel fees. In general, no allowance can be made in the final costs for counsel fees, or for any other extra expenses, except in the manner and to the extent stated in the previous part of this chapter, even in actions for special relief (Whittimore v. Whtittimore, 7 Paige, 38; see Sebring v. Mersereau, Hopk. 501); and in no case can such an allow- ance be made in an action for ordinary relief. But in courts of equity, costs were sometimes directed to be taxed as between solicitor and client, in which case full compensation was allowed for all charges of counsel, so that the party to whom such costs were allowed should be fully indemnified for the expenses of the litigation. (3 Dan. Ch. Pr. 77; 2 Barb. Ch. Pr. 337.),The power of the court to make such an allowance was not taken away by the statutes prior to the Code, and was exercised notwithstanding anything in them (see 624
Counsel fees. Disbursements. What are allowed. Irving v. DeKay, 9 Paige, 533; Gott v. Cook, 7 id. 544; gMinrse v. Cox, 5 Johns. Ch. 451); and it does not appear to be taken away by the Code (Hotling v. Marsh, 14 Abb. 161),* even in the cases expressly excepted from Â§ 309. (Ib.) This allowance is now made expressly under the name of counsel fees, there being no scale of costs between attorney and client. Such an allowance was made out of the fund in Phelps v. Pond (Ct. of Appeals, April, 1861), by order of the court, settled by DAVIES, J. That was an action for the construction of a will, which is expressly excluded from Â§ 309. Counsel fees were allowed to every party concerned. A similar allowance was made by Is- G~AHAM, J. (N. Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Vanderbilt, sp. t., 12 Abb. 458.) There is no precedent, certainly in this state, for the allowance of counsel fees in any case in which there is not a fund under the control of the court. Such charges cannot be made a part of the judgment against a party, to be collected from him personally. (W7ittimtore v. Whit- tinore, 7 Paige, 38.) And they cannot be allowed to the counsel of a party having no vested interest in the fund. (Got v. Cook, 7 Paige, 523, 544.),AnT. 15.-Disbursements. When costs are allowed to a party, his right to his necessary disbursements follows as a necessary incident. (Code, Â§ 311.) WhIt are allowed.]-Only necessary disbursements (Code, Â§ 311; Goodyear v. Baird, sp. t., 11 How. 377; Haynes v. slosher, sp. t., 15 id. 216), actually paid (Case v. Price, sp. t, 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348; Haynes v. Moslwr, sp. t., 15 How. 216), or liability for which has been actually in- curred (Haynes v. Mosher, supra), and which are incident,* But compare Williams v. Hernon (13 Abb. 297).,79,625
Disbursements. Fees of officers. Fees of referees to the regular proceedings in the action (ib.; Case v. pric, supra), can be taxed. Parties are not indemnified si their expenses in preparing for an action, or in asce. taining their rights. (Haynes v. Mosher, supra.),Fees of officers.]-The fees of officers, allowed by law, are taxable (Code, Â§ 311), including commissioners' feesou necessary affidavits (Swift v. De Witt, sp. t., 3 How. 280), though not on affidavits made for the purpose of a motion (Burnett v. Westfall, sp. t., 15 How. 430), sheriffs' and clerks' fees, &c. (Swift v. De Witt, supra; Case v. Pri, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348; Benedict v. Warriner, sp. t., 14 How. 568), provided they have been actually charged by such officers (Case v. Price, supra); but if the services for which fees are claimed were performed by any other person than the officer to whom regular fees are allowed by law, only a reasonable compensation for such services can be taxed. (Ib.),The expense of procuring a certified copy of an order of reference, is taxable, as it is proper that it should be furnished to the referee. (Toll v. Thomas, sp. t., 15 How, 315.),Fees paid for necessary searches and copies of papers from the clerk's office, including searches to ascertain the necessary parties to an action of foreclosure, &c., are taxable. (Case v. Price, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 34&),The sheriff's fee of 50 cents, for every term during which a cause is on the circuit calendar, is taxable (i.), but of course only for such time as it was properly thre,Fees of referees.]-The fees of referees in the cause aw taxable (Code, Â§ 311), but only at such a rate as they axe legally entitled to. (Shultz v. Whitney, sp. t., 9 Abe 71; 17 How. 471.) 626
Disbursements. Stenographer's fees. Witness fees. Stelograph7er'sfees.]-The fee required to be paid toward the stenographer's fund, in the first judicial district, is now taxable as a disbursement. (Code, Â§ 256.*) Witness fees.]-The fees of witnesses are taxable (Code, Â§ 311), if they have been actually incurred, even though not paid t (see Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Rogers v. ChaMnberlainl, sp. t., 7 Abb. 452; Haynes v. Moisher, sp. t., 15 How. 216), and if the witnesses have lawfully earned snch fees (Roth v. Meads, sp. t., 20 How. 287; Ford v. Monroe, sp. t., 6 How. 204; Clar7is v. Staring, sp. t., 4/ How. 243; Anon., 3 Hill, 457; see Dowling v. Bush, sp. t, 6 How. 410), but not otherwise (Ehke v. Bing7hanm, 4 Hill, 595; Booth v. Smith, 5 Wend. 107), nor even then, if without any special reason the party who summoned them allows them to return and remain home before the trial (Dowling v. Bush, sp. t., 6 How. 410), nor if they were sum- moned too late for the trial (see Clarks v. Staring, sp. t., 4 How. 243), nor unless the witnesses were material (Dea&t v. Willians, 6 Hill, 376; Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446), and necessary (ib.; Irwin v. Deyo, 2 Wend. 285; see Lowerre v. Vail, sp. t., 5 Abb. 227), and that, too, not merely in a gene- ral sense, but at the time of their being subpoenaed. (Pike v. Nash, sp. t., 16 How. 53.) Thus, if the party subpoenaing witnesses for a particular circuit has good reason to know that the cause will not be tried there, but referred (ib.; Crippen v. Brown, 11 Paige, 628), he cannot tax their fees. (b.) Where, in an action of slander, forty witnesses were summoned to prove the plaintiff's good character, of whom two only were sworn, the court allowed the fees of ten only to be taxed. (Irwin v. Deyo, 2 Wend. 285.) But,: ,- - _ *As amended, 18G3. Gl7macn v. Oliver (14 Abb. 174); Reynolds.v. Mayor & of. Y. (sp. t., id. 176 note); and Arnoux v. Pielan (sp. t., 21 How. 88), were decided before the amendment, and are obsolete. tSee to the contrary in certain cases, Crippen v. Brown (11 Paige, 633).
Disbursements. Witness fees. Party as witnes. in an action on a note, the defense being forgery, twelve witnesses having testified on a previous trial that the note was forged, and the jury having, nevertheles found it to be genuine, the defendant summoned on the new trial seventeen witnesses to the same point, and though the court only allowed five to be sworn, yet the defendant was held entitled to tax the fees of all. (Low. erre v. Vail, sp. t., 5 Abb. 227.),It is not indispensable that a witness should have been subpoenaed by the party who claims to tax his fees (Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Vence v. Speir, sp. t., 18 How. 168), but he must either have been examined as such at the trial (ib.), or attended at the request of such party (ib.) as his witness. (Brown v. Bowen, sp. t., 16 How. 544.),Where there are several causes between the same par- ties to be tried at the same time, the fees of a witness required in all of them may be separately taxed in all, for he would not be bound to testify in any one for which he was not paid. (Hicks v. Brennan, sp. t., 10 Abb. 304; .ence v. Speir, sp. t., 18 How. 168; Willinik v. 1eccle, 19 Wend. 82; and see Wilder v. Wheeler, sp. t., 1 How. 136),If a day calendar is made up, witness fees for attend. ance can be taxed only for'as many days as the cause stood on the day calendar, the court being in session, and the witnesses in attendance (Vence v. Speir, sp. t., 18 How. 168; Curtis v. Dutton, 4 Sands. 719), unless the witnesses come from a distance, in which case a reasonable time in addition may be allowed for their attendance, when they have been sent for in anticipation of the cause coming on. (Curtis v. Dutton, supra; Moulton v. Townsend, sp. t, 16 How. 306.),Party as witness.]-Fees paid to an adverse partyin order to compel his attendance as a witness, are of couse taxable (see Hewlett v. Brown, sp. t., 1 Bosw. 655; 7 Abh 74); and so, no doubt, are fees actually and necessarigj 628

Russell, sp. t., 7 Abb. 452, note; 16 How. 91), and even, we think, to a coplain- tiff for that purpose; but a party cannot tax witness fees and expenses for his own attendance as a witness (Case v. price, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348; * Cornell v. Potter, p. t., 15 How. 278; Logan v. Thomas, sp. t., 11 How. 160; Perry v. Livingston, sp. t., 6 How. 404; Christy v. Christy, 6 Paige, 170), unless he attended the trial solely for that purpose, and would not otherwise have attended it. (Hanna v. Dexter, sp. t., 15 Abb. 135; Bronner v. .Frauent7lal, sp. t., 12 id. 183; 20 How. 355; Logan v. Brooks, sp. t., 8 Abb. 127; 17 How. 29; Walker v. Russell, sp. t., 7 Abb. 452 nI.; 16 How. 91; Howes v. Barber, 18' Q. B. 588.) Witness' traveling fees.]-If a witness resides more than three miles from the court house, he is entitled to four cents per mile each way (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 922; Laws 1840, ch. 386), and this charge is of course taxable as p'rt of the witness fees. (Pike v. Nsash, sp. t., 16 How. 53; Mloul- ton v. Townsend, sp. t., id. 306.) When a witness is brought from another state, his travel fees are to be estimated from the court house to the point at which the state line crosses the nearest usually traveled road to his residence. (Hicks v. Brennan, sp. t., 10 Abb. 304; Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Hinds v. Schenectady Ins. Co., sp. t., 7 How. 142; Howland v. Lenox, 4 Johns. 311; see Duniham v. Sherinan, sp. t., 11 Abb. 152; 19 How. 572.) Nothing can be allowed for his travel beyond the state limits. (lb.) Expense of commnission.]-A reasonable compensation, actually paid to commissioners in taking depositions is * Citing a general term decision to the same effect. Querisskl v.

Sherman, sp. t., 11 Abb. 152; 19 How. 572; see Case v. Price, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348), but counsel fees upon the execution of the commission ar not. (Dun7ham v. Slhennan, supra.),Witness fees in such cases are regulated by our own statutes, in the absence of proof as to the fees allowed by law in the state where the commission was executed. (Ib.) Other disbitrseements.]-A reasonable compensation should be allowed for the service of necessary papers.,The expenses of serving subpoenas have been disallowed (Burnett v. Westfall, sp. t., 15 How. 430; see WheelerY. Lozee, 12 id. 446), but we cannot appreciate the reasons given for such a decision. It is said that such charges might in some cases be enormous, and exceed all the rest of the costs. The same might be said of other items, which no one thinks of disputing. Undoubtedly such charges should be closely watched, and kept within just limits; but if actually and necessarily incurred, why should not the party who has been wrongfully compelled to incur them, be reimbursed? In Rogers v. 2ogers (2 Paige, 458), and Christy v. Christy (6 id. 170), it was held that although there was no statutory allowance for such a service, yet 12Â½ cents should be taxed for each subpoena served, and we think that charge, at leastis still proper.,A reasonable charget may be allowed for the service of a notice of the object of the action, whether made by the sheriff or any other person, where such notice is necessary (Case v. Price, sp. t., 9 Abb. 111; 17 How. 348; BeIedid * $25 per diem allowed on an English commission. (Dunham v. Shemg, sp.'t., 11 Abb. 152; 19 How. 572.) t37i cents (OGalagher v.

Eagan, 2 ands. 742), and so, where the summons is served by a person other than a sheriff, a reasonable compensation, not necessarily equal to the sheriff's fee, but not more, should be allowed. (Case v. Price, supra.) The principle on which these cases were decided appears to us incon- sistent with that of Burnett v. Westfal (supra.) The expense of printing papers, when required by a rule of court, is taxable (Code, Â§ 311), but in analogy to the practice when papers were charged for by the folio (Crippcl v. Brown, 11 Paige, 628; Rogers v. Rogers, 2 id. 458; see Waller v. Harris, 7 id. 479), a deduction should be made for all useless and prolix matter; as where all the evidence is inserted in a bill of exceptions, or where the pleadings of the party making up the case are exces- sively verbose. The expenses of room hire, fire and lights, for the pur- pose of a reference, have been held taxable (Bailey v. Hanford, 10 Wend. 622), though such items will not be allowed to the referee himself, and if paid to him cannot be taxed.,J, CH~AsriLPTER CII. COSTS ON MOTIONS AND SPECIAL APPLICATIONS. ARTICLE 1.

To what proceedings applicable. Costs in the cause, &c, To w7at proceedings applicable.]-This provision applies to all applications to the court or a judge for any direc. tions. made or entered in writing, and not included in a judgment (Code, % 400, 401), except applications for judg. ment upon a special verdict, or a verdict subject to the opinion of the court, or for a new trial on a case made, or where exceptions are ordered to be heard in the first in. stance at a general term under Â§ 265. (Code, Â§ 307, subd. 5.),It includes, therefore, a motion to dismiss a complaint for want of diligence in prosecuting the action (Tillspaugh v. Dic7, sp. t., 8 How. 33), and a motion for judgment on the answer or demurrer as frivolous. (Bell v. Noah, 24 How. 478; Butc7ters' and Drovers' Banll v. Jacobson, sp. t, 22 How. 470; Rochester Ban7k v. Rapelje, 12 id. 26; Mar- quisee v. Brig7hat, sp. t., id. 399; Roberts v. Clark, sp. t, 10 id. 451; Gould v. Carpenter, sp. t., 7 id. 97.*),It also applies to appeals from orders granted on mo- tions (Savage v. Darrow, sp. t., 4 How. 74), but not to an appeal from an order of judgment upon a demurrer made after a regular trial. (P7ldils v. Van Cott, 15 How. 110.),Costs of motion not Itride.]-The court has no power to award costs for making a motion not yet made. (Botne v. Anthony, sp. t., 13 How. 301.),Costs in the cause, &c.]-Costs of a motion are some- times allowed as "costs in the cause" (see Btulkelql v. Keteltas, 2 Sands. 735), which means that they are to be added to the costs on judgment, if the party to whom they are granted recovers final costs, or deducted from such costs, if the other party is finally successful.,I,' other cases, they are directed to "abide the event" (Code, Â§ 315), which means that they are to be allowed, as costs in the cause, to the party finally successful in the action; unless they are given only to a specified party, in which case, if he fails in the action, no one gets them.,* See cases contra, ante, p. 425.
When allowed. Not on ex parte motion. Not where unasked. W'lten allowed.]-Though the matter rests in the discre- tion of the judge by whom the motion is heard, and his decision cannot be reviewed (Dennison v. Dennison, 9 HIow. 246; Dickoson v. 3'?Elwain, 7 How. 138), unless this discretion is abused (Bowne v. Ant7wny, sp. t., 13 How. 301),* or in a plain case of mistake (see Leighton v. Wood, 17 Abb. 177), there are certain rules by which the courts are usually guided in the exercise of this dis- cretion, which it is important to notice. Not on ex parte motions.] -It is a just, and apparently inflexible rule, that no costs can be allowed on wx 1)rrte motions (Bowne v. Antowny, sp. t., 13 How. 301), which of course includes all motions in an action in which the defendant has not appeared. (Ib.) Notthv7tere unaslced.]-It is a general rule that no costs will be allowed on granting a motion by default, unless asked in the notice of motion or order to show cause (Northrop v. Van Deusen, sp. t., 5 How. 134; 3 Code Rep. 140; Crippen v. Ingersoll, 10 Wend; 603; Maann v. King, 18 Ves. 297; see Banta v. Marcellus, 2 Barb. 373), even though the notice contains the common clause in relation to "other and further relief" (ib.); but if the adverse party appears at the hearing, he may be charged with costs (Banta v. Marcelluls, 2 Barb. 373; Powell v. Coc7erell, 4 Hare, 572; Butler v. Gardener, 12 Beav. 526; Clark v. Jaqiues, 11 id. 623; but see contra, Saratoga B. t. Co., v. M'Coy, sp. t., 9 How. 339), though not, we think, unless his opposition is quite unreasonable. (Maygrath v. Veitch, 1 Molloy, 234.) If costs are not claimed, either in the notice or upon the argument, none are allowed. (G-tilford v. Cornell, sp. t., 4 Abb. 225.) * Such we take to be the principle of this decision. And it is supported by analogy from the rules concerning other discretionary powers of judges.,80,633
When to successful party. Where too much is asked. When to successful party.]-As a general rule, costs are allowed to the party who succeeds on the motion, unless he asks a mere favor, in which case he is not entitled to costs (oTones v. T. 8. Slate Co., sp. t., 16 How. 135; see Leighton v. Wood, 17 Abb. 177), and if he Is himself in fault, will usually be charged with them. (Leighton v. Wood, supra.),When a motion is properly no 'de for a necessary pur. pose, but after service of the notice the adverse party corrects the error or supplies the defect on which the motion was based, he may, nevertheless, be charged with costs of the motion, though it be denied as having been obviated. (Hill v. Smith, sp. t., 2 How. 242.),Costs have been granted to the mover, on denying a motion, where he was misled into making it by the state- ments of the opposing party. (Leonard v. Manard, 1 Hall, 200.),Where too much is asked.]-Where the notice of motion asks for more than the mover is entitled to, no costs should be allowed to him (Askins v. Hearns, sp. t., 3 Abb. 190; Corbin v. St. George, sp. t., 2 id. 465; Hubbard v. Nat Prot. Ins. Co., sp. t., 11 How. 149, 154; Penfield v. White, sp. t., 8 How. 87; Steam Nav. Co. v. Weed, sp. t., id. 49; Whipple v. Williams, sp. t., 4 id. 28; Bates v. Loomis, 5 Wend. 78; see MPKenzie v. Hackstaff, 2 E. D. Smith, 75), even though he waives his excessive demands on the hearing (Bates v. Loomis, 5 Wend. 78), and where the adverse party attended the hearing solely to prevent an unwarrantable degree of relief from being granted, the mover was charged with costs as a condition of granting so much of his motion as was proper (Smith v. Jones, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 33; see Stwrch v. Young, 5 Beav. 557), although the notice was in an alternative form, and one of the alternatives was proper. (lb.),Therefore, if costs are asked in cases in which the court never grants them, the mover will be charged with coOt,
Needless opposition. Unnc~essary motions. on granting his motion. (Phelps v. Wasson, sp. t., 2 How. 126.*) And where costs would not otherwise be imposed upon denying a motion, they will be allowed, if the notice of motion asked for costs. (Battershall v. Davis, sp. t., 23 How. 383; Weeks v. Sout7hvick, sp. t., 12 How. 170.),Needless opposition.] -Costs will be granted against a party who makes a needless opposition to a motion in cases where otherwise they would not be, and so where in an ordinary case a motion would be granted only upon payment of costs, it will be granted without costs if unfairly and uselessly opposed. (Bell v. Judson, sp. t., 2 How. 42; May v. May, 11 Paige, 201; see anle v. Fan Frank;en, 5 Paige, 62.) Unnecessary motions.]-If a motion is unnecessarily made for the mere purpose of obtaining costs, none will be allowed. (Kane v. an Vrankcen, 5 Paige, 62; Stiles v. Fisher, sp. t., 3 How. 52.) And if the terms thus pre- viously offered are imposed upon the hearing, the moving party should be charged with costs. (Butler sv. Gore, 2 Hogan, 103.) Therefore, though the relief asked is proper, yet if the other party has offered to consent to its being granted upon fair terms, costs will be withheld. (Stiles v. tFsher, sp. t., 3 How. 52 ;f Abbey v. Disosway, sp. t., 1859.t) For this reason, where several motions are made upon facts which could be presented in a single set of papers, costs of one motion only are allowed, though different sets of papers are used (Hornfager v. Hornfager, sp. t., 6 How. 13; Post v. Jenkins, sp. t., 2 id. 33; Gortland Co. Ins. * This was a motion for change of venue. The court had then no power to grant costs to the moving party on such a motion. It now has. tIn this case, the costs were ordered to abide the event. t In this case, ROOSEVELT, J., denied a motion to set aside a complaint for rregularity, with $10 costs:-the moving party having refused an offer of $10 costs to abide the event as a condition of amendment, and the motion being mado upon purely technical grounds.,635
Unnecessary motions. New questions. Co. v. Lathrop, sp. t., id. 146), and though the motions are made in different causes brought by the same plain. tiff against different defendants. (Ib.),The rule is, of course, the same where only one set of papers is used (Schernterhorn v. Noble, 1 Denio, 652; Jerome v. Boeram, 1 Wend. 293; Jackson v. Keller, 18 Johns. 310), and in such case, if the motions are denied, single costs only will be allowed Jacekson v. Ganlsey, 3 Cow. 385), though we apprehend that more would be allowed upon denying motions multiplied with an evident view to making extra costs.,In one instance, where two motions were made on the same papers in a single cause, they were granted upon payment of costs for opposing, as a penalty for the need- less multiplication of proceedings. (Mitchell v. Westervelt, sp. t., 6 How. 265.*),New questions.]-It is not usual to allow costs upon the decision of new and unsettled questions, sufficiently doubt- ful and important to justify their submission to the court (Ely v. Holton, 15 N. Y. 600; Purchase v. Jackson, 14 How. 230; Giraud v. Beach, 4 E. D. Smith, 27; Buckcman v. Carnley, sp. t., 9 How. 185; Estus v. Baldwin, sp. t., id. 82; Ostrom v.

Shhufelt, sp. t., 120), nor where the failing party has been misled by a recent decision (Tindal v. Jones, 11 Abb. 261; Giraud v. Beach, 4 E. D. Smith, 27; S. 0., 10 How. 369; see Noble v. Trotter, sp. t., 4 How. 322), or even bya dictum on a new question (Silliman v. Eddy, sp. t., 8 How.,* Affirmed, id. 311. 636

Smith, 635.),On defective notice.--Costs should be allowed the suc- cessful party on denying a motion on account of defects in the notice, as well as when decided upon the merits (Donaldson v. Jackson, 9 Wend. 450; Anon., 18 id. 578), though full costs ought not to be awarded in such case. (Anon., 18 Wend. 578.) On setting aside irregularities.]-Subject to the forego- ing general rules, it is usual to allow costs to the moving party on setting aside irregular proceedings (Kellogg v. Klock, sp. t., 2 Code lep. 28; see Beach v. Sout7uworth, 6 Barb. 173; 1 Code Rep. 99), including ex parte orders irregularly obtained. (Dozvs v. Parker, 4 1i. Y. Leg. Obs. 384; Opdyke v. Marble, sp. t., N. Y. Trans., Sept. 14,1864.),On motion for allowanlce.]-Neither party should have costs of motion on an application for a discretionary al- lowance in addition to costs (semble, Dickson v. M'Eluain, 7 How. 138) unless indeed the case is one in which the court has no power to make such allowance.,On motion for discovery.]--Costs should be allowed on an order for discovery or inspection of papers, to the mov- ing party, if he applied to his opponent therefor, before coming into court (Townsend v. Lawrence, 9 Wend. 458), but if he did not, his motion should be granted only upon his paying costs. (Ib.; Deas v. Harvie, 2 Barb. Ch. R. 456; King v. Clark, 3 Paige, 76; Burnett v. Sanders, 4 Johns. Oh. 503; Weymoutl& v. Boyer, 1 Yes. Jr. 423.),On motion for consolidation.]-Costs should be allowed to the defendant upon consolidating actions against him, if the actions were commenced simultaneously, or under,637
On motion for coneolidation. Order to fix costs. circumstances indicating an intention to make the pro. ceedings burdensome to him, unless a satisfactory explana- tion is given (see Dunning v. Bani of Auburn, 19 Wend. 23; Bank of the United States v. Strong, 9 id. 451); and in other cases, if the plaintiff, without reasonable grounds of objection, refuses on request to consolidate the actions. (Dunning v. Banki of Auburn, supra.) But unless these circumstances appear affirmatively, no costs are allowed. (Ferris v. Betts, sp. t., 2 How. 78.),Costs should be allowed to the plaintiff on denying such a motion. (Cooper v. Weed, sp. t., 2 How. 40.),On mnotion to change place of trial.]-Costs should be allowed to abide the event, on motions to change the place of trial. (Northrop v. Yan Dusen, sp. t., 5 How. 134; see Miorrison v. Ide, sp. t., 4 id. 304; Norton v. Ric, 20 Johns. 475.*),On motion for conmmission.]-Upon a motion for a com, mission to take testimony, costs should abide the event, if the motion was made with reasonable promptness (Foster v. Agassiz, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 150; see Bank of St. Albans v. lKnickerbacker, 7 Wend. 532); otherwise, if proceedings in the action are stayed, the order should be conditioned on payment of costs. (La Sarge v. Luce, 2 Wend. 242.),Order on admissions.]-Costs of a motion for satisfaction of a part of a claim admitted by the pleadings may be included in the order, but the court cannot award in it the costs of the action. Those must remain until final judg- ment is rendered. (Russellv. Meac7lm, sp. t., 16 How. 193.),Order to fix costs.]-The order, as granted, must fix the amount of costs, or designate some officer to settle the,* See a fuller collection of authorities in regard to costs on this motio, (ante, i. 643-545.) 638

A new trial may be moved for upon a case, or excep- tions, or the judge's minutes, or upon some ground of favor alone. (See ante, p. 548.) New trial as a favor.]-If a new trial is granted as a matter of favor, it is usual to impose the payment of costs as a condition. It is upon such terms that a new trial is granted on the ground of newly discovered evidence (Simnmons v. Fay, 1 E. D. Smith, 107), and the same rule prevails on granting a new trial for errors or misconduct of the jury only (Harris v. Panama I. R., 5 Bosw. 312; .nort7 v. Sergeant, 33 Barb. 350; S. C. again, 14 Abb. 223; Ward v. Woodburn, 27 Barb. 346; Brown v. Bradshawi, 1 Daer, 199; Conrad v. WPilliams, 6 Hill, 444; Goodyear v. Ogden, 4 Hill, 104; Bankt of Utlica v. Ives, 17 Wend. 501), t but not on setting aside the report of a referee. (Went- worth v. Cand 17 How. 405; see Smith v. Sclancl, 18 Barb. 344; Scr0iton1 v. Baxter, 4 Sands. 5.) The amount of costs, upon such relief being granted, is governed by considerations which will be stated in the next article of this chapter. New trial on. a case.]-On a motion for a new trial upon a case or exceptions, it is discretionary with the court to grant or refuse costs, but it is usual to order them to abide the event of the action. There has been much conflict of opinion in regard to * Thomas v. Clark (sp. t, 5 How. 375), which limits this rule, is not to be followed.,In Green v. Burke (23 Wend. 490); Knapp v. Curtis (9 id. 60); and Tan Rensselaer v. Dole (1 Johns. Cas. 279), costs were ordered to abide the event in somewhat similar cases. But sea Gfrea v. Burke explained (4 Hill, 106).,639

(Code,'Â§ 307, sub. 5.*) For making and serving a case, $20 are allowed, and if it necessarily contains more than 50 folios, 810 additional; and for making and serving amendments, $10. (Code, Â§ 307.t) And according to the weight of authority, term fees are also taxable (subject to.the general rules stated ante, p. 611) for the period during which the motion is necessarily on the calendar under Rule 40 of the Supreme Court. (Dechanics' Bkig. Asso. v. KZiersted, 4 Duer, 639; 10 How. 400;f Drake v. Coc7iroft, 9 id. 479;11 Tail Schaick v. Winne, sp. t., 8 How. 5;t fol- lowed in Malam v.

Jacobs, sp. t., 10 id. 453.**),New trial on judge's minutes.] -Where a new trial is granted by the judge on his minutes, it is clear that the costs given specially by Â§ 307 upon a new trial on a case, cannot be allowed.,Costs of a motion seem to be all that are allowable on granting the motion as a right, except that the additional,*As amended, 1862. By a clerical error, the point was previously left in doubt, although the meaning of the legislature was perfectly clear. (See Jackeet v. Judd, sp. t., 18 How. 385.),tAs amended, 1863,1864. t These cases held the hearing of the motion to be a trial, and allowed term and trial fees.,| These cases went on the ground that the proceeding was not a tria, but that term fees were taxable on all enumerated motions. ** These cases deny that there is any distinction between enumerated and non-enumerated motions, as to costs.
Costs on granting favors. Amending pleadings. costs necessarily incurred may be ordered to abide the event. If the motion is granted as a favor, or for errors of the jury only, motion-costs, and costs of such proceedings as are necessarily vacated thereby, should be imposed upon the party to whom the favor is granted.,ART. 3.-Costs on granting favors. When a favor is granted to the prejudice of a party not himself in fault in the premises, it is usual to impose terms, which usually consist in the payment of costs. Discretion as to costs.]-When a favor is granted with a direction that costs be adjusted before any officer other than the judge granting the order, such officer has no discretion as to the amount of costs, but must adhere to the principles hereafter stated; whereas, if the judge himself adjusts the costs, his discretion is absolute as against the party to whom the favor is granted (Smith v. Dodd, 4 E. D. Smith, 643), except, no doubt, in a case of positive abuse of such discretion, as for example, if more costs should be exacted as the condition of a favor, than could be charged on final judgment. The party whose proceedings are vacated by the favor of the court has, it would seem, a right to require an adherence to these rules in all cases (see Union Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267), and though it is not probable that an appeal would lie on such a question, yet when it has been taken on ether grounds, the appellate court has corrected errors in this respect. (Leighton v. Wood, 17 Abb. 177; Union Bank v. fott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267; Bank of Utica v. Ives, 17 Wend. 501.) Principles.]-The general principle which controls the amount of costs in such cases is, that the party required to pay costs shall be charged with the costs of all pro- ceedings which will be vacated by the order granted to him. (Yan Talkenbuirglb v. an, Schaick, sp. t., 8 How. 271; see Union Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267.),81,641
AiLendingplcadings.] -The rule in all cases of amending pleadings is, that the amendment shall not be made at the expense of the opposite party, and that he must be indem. nified for all additional expense involved in such amend. ment. (sUniona Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267; rev'g S. 0., 10 Abb. 372.),Therefore, where an amendment of the complaint is allowed, the costs of proceedings before notice of trial should be imposed upon the plaintiff, where a new answer would be required (Hendricks v. Bouck, 4 E. D. Smith, 461; 2 Abb. 360; Yan Falkenbutrgh v. Van Schmais, sp. t., 8 How. 271); and if the amendment is allowed upon demurrer, all subsequent costs are charged (ib.; Collonm v. Caldwell, sp. t., 5 How. 336), because the whole pro. ceedings are superseded. And the same costs have been imposed on allowing a material amendment to the com- plaint, after a juror had been withdrawn on the trial for the purpose of giving the plaintiff an opportunity to move. (See Snmit7l v. Dodd, 4 E. D. Smith, 643.) But if judgment is given against the demurrer, and the demurrant is allowed to withdraw it, he cannot be charged with the costs of proceedings before notice of trial, inasmuch as they remain unimpaired. (Piipps v. Van Cott, 15 How. 121; Crary v. Norwood, sp. t., 5 Abb. 219; Anon., 3 SandÂ£ 756; Code Rep. N. S. 214; NYellis v. De Forest, sp. t., 6 How. 413; see Young v. Gori, sp. t., 13 Abb. 13 n.) And where the defendant is allowed to amend his answer, he is not charged with costs of proceedings before notice of trial, inasmuch as the complaint would stand unaffected (see Van Valkenbiurg v. Van Schaick, sp. t., 8 How. 271), though if he amended a counterclaim, or amended by inserting a counterclaim, the case would be somewhat different, as a new pleading would be necessary on the part of the plaintiff.,Costs thus pai4 on amendments cannot be deducted from the costs on final judgment against the party amending.

On granting favors. Amendments. Postponement. New trial. Where the court can see that the amendment will in- volve no necessity for any abandonment or alteration of the proceedings had by the opposite party, no costs will be allowed except costs of the motion, and not even these when the error to be amended is merely formal and can- not have misled the adverse party. (Bank of Havana v. Magee, 20 N. Y. 360; Manning v. Dunn, 14 Barb. 583; see (ayiuga Bank v. Warden, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 27; Hunt v. Lounsbury, 18 N. Y. 515; Clark v. Dales, 20 Barb. 67.) Postponement.]-Costs may be imposed as a condition of granting a postponement of a trial before a court or referee, not to exceed $10 and witness fees. (Code, Â§ 314.) No greater amount of costs can be charged in such case. (Iyoxon v. Bentley, sp. t., 6 How. 418.*) If costs thus imposed are not paid immediately, the party entitled to them may proceed with the trial (see i Blkeley v. Keteltas, 2 Sands. 735; Code Rep. N. S. 119; Bagley v. Ostrom, 5 Hill, 516; lKirby v. Sisson, 1 Wend. 83), or may apply for an order requiring their payment (Kirby v. Sisson, and see other cases, supra), but if he adopts the latter course, he must do so promptly, other wise they will be only allowed as costs in the cause. (Bulkeley v. Keteltas, supra.) Payment of such costs cannot be enforced by attach- ment. (Yreeland v. lHghes, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 42.) New trial.]-It has been already stated that when a new trial is granted on any other ground than an error of the judge who tried the cause, the party applying for a new trial will be required to pay costs. (Ante, p. 639.) The costs properly chargeable in such a case, as the condition of granting the new trial, are the costs of the trial, and of subsequent proceedings, and no more. (North *Shanks v. Rae (sp. t., 19 How. 540), if to the contrary, which is doubt- si is not to be regarded as authority.,643

Bradshaw, 1 id. 199.) And this is therefore the amount taxable under an order for a new trial on payment of " costs," without specifying *the amount of costs. (See ib.),More costs (including all subsequent to notice of trial), were, however, granted in Ellsworth v. Gooding (8 How. 1),* and less in M'QItade v. Erie R. R. Co. (5 Duer, 613; 11 How. 434.),When "costs of the trial" only are imposed by the order, only a trial fee, and actual disbursements at the trial, including witnesses' fees for attendance there, are chargeable. (M'Quade v. N. Y. & Erie B. 1. Co., 5 Duer, 613; 11 How. 434.),An extra allowance can never be imposed as part of the costs to be paid on granting a new trial (M'Qutade v. N. Y. & Erie R. R. Co., 5 Duer, 613; 11 How. 434; Troy & Boston R. R. Co. v. Tibbits, sp. t., 11 How. 168; Hice v. Waltermire, sp. t., 7 id. 370), though it may be, as a condition of opening judgment. (En2sworth v. Gooding, sp. t., 8 How. 1.f),Vacating judgment.]-On setting aside a judgment, only the costs of motion, and the costs of entering judg- ment (one dollar) are allowed (Mann v. Provost, sp. t., 3 Abb. 446; Dix v. Palmer, sp. t., 5 How. 233; Traverv. Silvernail, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 96; see Tripp v. Vincent, 8 Paige, 176; Millspaugh v. McBride, 7 id. 509); iunless an extra allowance has been granted under Â§ 308 or 309 of the Code, in which case there is a precedent for requiring that also to be paid (Ellswortht v. Gooding, sp. t., 8 How. 1), though the decision has always been regarded as of doubtful authority.,* Reported at special term, but this point decided at general term. t+A explained (Toy &c. R. . v.

On granting favors. Submission of controversy. Special verdict. These costs, however, are only enough to warrant the opening of the judgment. If that was founded upon a trial or inquest, the additional costs of setting aside such proceedings will be required, if they also are vacated. (Arillimnla v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., sp. t., 18 How. 542.),Vacating inquest.]-The costs to be allowed on vacating an inquest, as a matter of favor, are a trial fee, the clerk's trial fee, witness fees, costs of subsequent proceedings, if any (which cannot often be the case), and costs of the motion. (Carpenter v. Tuffs, sp. t., 2 How. 166; Deeth v. Purdy, sp. t., 1 How. 43; liiley v. Fan Amringe, sp. t., id. 41; Fowler v. Hay, sp. t., id. 38.) Under peculiar circum- stances, the costs have been ordered to abide the event. (Quidore v. Van Clief, sp. t., 2 How. 201; Faulkner v. Brooklyn, sp. t., id. 151.) Stipulation to try.]-On allowing a plaintiff to stipulate, on motion to dismiss the complaint for not bringing the cause to trial according to the practice of the court, he should be charged with all the defendant's costs up to that time. (Bowles v. Fan Horne, sp. t., 11 Abb. 84; 19 How. 346.) AnT. 4.-Costs on applications for judgment to the general,term. Submission of controversy.]-Where a controversy is submitted to the general term under Â§ 372 of the Code, costs are discretionary or otherwise in the same cases as where an action is brought. The costs of this proceeding, when allowed, are the costs of a trial, not of an appeal (Neilson v. Mutual Ins. Co., 3 Duer, 683), but without costs for any proceedings before trial. (Code, Â§ 373.) Special verdict.]-Upon a special verdict, the party en- titled to costs recovers $15 for proceedings before argu- ment and $30 for argument (Code, Â§ 307), besides term fees,645

But where several defend- ants unite in one appeal, though appearing by separate attorneys, and there is but one set of papers, one argu- ment and one judgment, the respondent is entitled to but one bill of costs. (Everson v. Gehrmnan, sp. t., 2 Abb. 413.*) Discretion, how guided.]-The rules heretofore stated as guiding the discretion of the court in respect to costs (ante, lpp 594-606), are applicable to appeals in many re- spects; with this difference, that in case of affirmance, the appellant is in fault for resisting a just decision, and must therefore have a very good excuse to avoid costs. (Mow- att v. Carow, 7 Paige, 328.) In the vast majority of cases in the Court of Appeals (which may be supposed to afford the best guide for all the courts), costs are awarded to the successful party, whether appellant or respondent, and whatever may be the nature of the action. In twelve terms of that court, of which we have memoranda of the decisions, we have found but one instance of an appeal from a judgment in a civil action, in which the decision was wholly in favor of one of the parties, and yet without costs, and in that case the judgment was affirmed. Without any exception which we have been able to discover, the Court of Appeals has been in the habit of directing the costs to abide the event of the action, on ordering a new trial. These costs should include all the costs in the cause, both in the appellate court and the court below. (1obbins v. Hudson River B. R., 7 Bosw. 1; Jacobsohn v. Belmont, id. 14.) It was said in a case decided in 1852 (Bogardus v. 2osendalo Mfg. Co., 1 Duer, 592), to be the regular prac- tice of the Court of Appeals to grant no costs in that court on reversing a judgment in an action for special relief, and such was undoubtedly the former practice of,* Erroneously reported as at general term.,647
In general. Discretion, how guided. Double costs. that court (Bouchaud v. Dias, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 201), but that practice was rendered obsolete by the Code (see Montgomery Bank v. Albany Ban1k, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 465), and we believe that it is now usual to grant costs of the appeal to the appellant on reversal, except in those cases in which, under the principles, heretofore stated, costs are denied for special reasons.,Where neither party is entirely successful, neither should, as a general rule, have costs (Dutffy v. Duncan, 32 Barb. 587; Pic7ktt v. Barron, 29 id. 505, 509; Stafford v. Mott, 3 Paige, 100), but if the judgment is affirmed in every point except one comparatively unimportant (HIigbie v. WestlakTe, 14 N. Y. 281), as where a judgment for $1,500 was reduced $150, on an appeal claiming an allowance for many other items, the appellant should pay costs. (Ib.),When a judgment is reversed on points which might have been, but were not, raised in the court below, neither party should have costs (Youngs v. Wilson, 24 Barb. 510; see Shaver v. Brainard, 29 id. 25); and when a judgment is affirmed on all points except such as these, full costs should (other things being equal) be allowed to the respondent. (JTones v. Phelps, 2 Barb. Ch. R. 440; Steward v. Green, 11 Paige,' 535; Wallace v. Patten, 12 Clark & Fin. 491.),In the absence of special circumstances, where a judg- ment is affirmed as to one of two co-parties, and reversed as to the other, costs will be allowed in favor of the for- mer and against the other. (Montgomery Bank v. Albany Bank, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 459, 465; see Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327.),Double costs.]-A respondent who was entitled to double costs in the court below, is entitled to double costs of the appeal, on the judgment being affirmed. (Burckle v. Iuce, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 239; 3 How. 236; Wiheeloc7 v. Hotch- kiss, 18 How. 468.) But a successful appellant cannot recover double costs. (Wheelock v. Hotchkiss, 18 How. 648

Therefore, where an officer, sued for his acts as sach, appeals from a judgment against him, and such judgment is reversed, and an appeal being taken from the decision of the appellate court, it is affirmed, he recovers double costs on the latter appeal, and single costs only on the former. (Whieeock v. Hotchkiss, supra.) Treble costs.]-The same rules undoubtedly apply to treble costs. (Estus v. Baldwiin, sp. t., 9 How. 80.) Extra allowance.]-The extra allowances authorized by tÂ§ 308 and 309 of the Code cannot be granted by an appellate court. (Wolfe v. Van tostranl, 2 N.Y. [2 Comst.] 570; 4 How. 208; Martin v. McCormick, 3 Sands. 755; Van Rensselaer v. .idd, sp. t., 5 How. 242.) Dismissal of apleal.]-When the court has a discretion in the premises, it will not grant costs on dismissing an appeal from a non-appealable proceeding, if it was pre- viously an unsettled question whether it was appealable or not (Ct. of Appeals, Chittenden v. Missionary Society, 8 How. 327), especially if the appellant is clearly suffering injustice from the decision below (N. Y. Ice Co. v. North- western Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414), nor if the objection is raised for the first time at the hearing of the appeal on the merits, and could have been previously raised by motion. (Williams v. Fitch, 15 Barb. 654.) When the right of appeal is taken away by the legisla- ture during the pendency of an appeal, no costs should be allowed on dismissing it. (Ct. of Appeals, Porter v. Jones, 7 How. 192; Gale v. Wisner, id. 191.) Such an appeal was so dismissed, on motion of the appellant, though it had been taken after the passage of the statute destroy- ing the right of appeal, but before it took effect, and in good faith, and in which no step had been taken since,82,649
To the court of appeals. Costs on affirmance or reveral the court had rendered a decision upon the effect of the statute. (Porter v. Jones, supra.),ART. 2.-Costs on appeals to the Court of Appeals. The provisions of the Code in regard to costs apply to the Court of Appeals as much as to the inferior courts, and supersede all former rules inconsistent therewith. (Montgomery Bank v. Albany Bank, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 465.),The amount of costs in this court is the same in all classes of appeals, whether from judgments or orders in a civil action (White v. Anthony, 23 N. Y. 164), or from a decision in a special proceeding (Laws 1854, c7. 270; People v. Sturtevant, 3 Duer, 616; 9 How. 304), except that an extra allowance can be made only on an appeal from a judgment. (Code, Â§ 307.),Term fees.]-In this court, a term fee is allowed for every term during which the cause is necessarily on the calendar, without any limit to the number of terms. (Glentwiorth v. MAount, 17 Abb. 15; Shaw v. Diwight, id. 18; Adams v. Perkins, sp. t., 25 How. 368.),But none can be allowed for any term before the return was filed. (Reformed Dutch Ch. v. Brown, 24 How. 89.),Costs on affirmance or reversal.]-The costs to which the party recovering costs is entitled, upon a decision on the merits, are $30 for proceedings before argument, $60 for argument, term fees, under the rules heretofore stated (ante, p. 611), $20 for preparing and serving a case, and disbursements. (Code, Â§ 307,# 311.),The court may also, in its discretion, award damages for delay, upon affirming a judgment, not exceeding ten per cent. of its amount. (Code, Â§ 307, subd. 6.) Where such damages are awarded " upon the judgment," in general terms, the percentage is to be estimated upon the whole,* As amended, 1864.

An award of "interest by way of damages for delay" carries simple interest only, to which the successful re- spondent would be entitled in any case, and not double interest, which is never allowed. (Hoard v. Garner, 4 Sands. 677.) Dismissal of appeal.]-When an appeal is dismissed on motion, "with costs," the respondent is entitled to the costs for proceedings before argument and to his dis- bursements (Peterson v. Dickel, sp. t., 8 Abb. 259; lianouse v. Martin, 2 Sands. 739), and to no more (Kanouse v. Martin, supra), but if "costs of the motion" are given, as they may be, he recovers $10 in addition. (Ib.) He cannot recover term fees if the appeal is dismissed at the first term (ib.), nor, we apprehend, in any case, unless he can show that he could not get a hearing for the motion at the first term, since the cause would not in any other case be necessarily on the calendar for two terms. If, however, the appeal is dismissed with costs, after argument on the merits, the respondent is entitled to full costs, including the fee for argument and term fees. (Irving Bank v. Palmer, sp. t., 1st dist., July, 1864; Webb v. Norton, sp. t., 10 How. 117; see White v. Anthony, 23 N. Y. 164.),ART. 3.-Costs on appeal to a general term.* Appeals from judgmenlts.]-The costs to which the party recovering costs is entitled on appeals from a judgment of the special term, or of another court of record, to the general term, are $20 before argument and $40 for argu- * This article does not apply to appeals from the marine or district courts of New York city to the general term of the Common Pleas, nor to appeals from a justice's court to the Superior Court of Buffalo. (Code, Â§ 371.),651
To general term. Appeals from orders ment (Code, Â§ 307, subd. 5),* with term fees and disburse. ments as heretofore prescribed. (Ante, pl. 611-625.),Appeals from orders for new trial.]-On an appeal from an order granting or refusing a new trial upon a case, the same costs are allowed as upon an appeal from a judg. ment. Section 307 grants such costs on a motion for a new trial, and it is clearly to be inferred that the costs on an appeal from an order made on such motion are not to be less than those of the order itself.,When an order granting a new trial as a matter of favor, is affirmed on appeal, the respondent will not be charged with costs of the appeal, but only with those of the motion below. (North v. Sargent, 13 Abb. 259.),Appeals from orders on demuntrrers.]-On an appeal from an order sustaining or overruling a demurrer, made upon a regular trial, the successful party, recovers costs as upon the trial of an issue of law.t (Plipps v. Van, Cott, 15 How. 110; Sutherland v. Tyler, sp. t., 11 id. 251; Van Schaiek v. WVinne, sp. t., 8 id. 5; overruling Nellis v. De Fores, sp. t., 6 id. 413. Compare Ives v. Miller, 19 Barb. 196.),This rule has been held not to apply to an appeal from an order upon a demurrer to a part only of a pleading (Drnummond v. Husson, 1 Duer, 633; 8 How. 246), but we are unable to distinguish between the two cases.,Appeals from special proceedings.--On appeals from the decisions of inferior courts in special proceedings, including proceedings in surrogates' courts, costs may be awarded and collected in such manner as the court may direct, as upon an issue of law. (Code, Â§ 3184),This branch of practice not being within the scope of our work, we simply refer to Haviland v. White (7 How. * As amended, 1864. t For the amount of these costs, see ante, p. 609. tAs amended, 1862.

Flake (sp. t., 14 How. 527), in which the effect of this section was considered. Appeals from other orders.]-Costs on appeals from other orders are the same as upon original motions (Drrumnond v. tiUsson, 1 Duer, 633; 8 How. 246; Savage v. Darrow, sp. t., 4 How. 74); and are therefore equally in the discretion of the court (ib.; Ives v. Miller, 19 Barb. 196), not to exceed $10. It is an almost invariable rule to grant $10 costs upon affirming an order. (Pulrchase v. Bellows, 16 Abb. 105.) For the rules which guide the discretion of the court in other cases, see ante, p. 634. Dismissal of appeal.]-The same rules apply to the dismissal of appeals from judgments to the general term, as in the Court of Appeals. (Irving Bank v. Palmer, sp. t., 1st dist., July, 1864.) For the amount of costs on such dismissal, see therefore ante, p. 651. On the dismissal of an appeal from an order, of course not more than $10 costs can be allowed.,A.T. 4.-Costs on appeals from a jutstice's court. The amendment of 1862 to Â§ 371 of the Code was so ill prepared that the amount of costs recoverable under it. is a matter of considerable doubt. After providing for an offer to compromise on the part of the respondent,* Â§ 371, as amended in 1862, 186. and 1864, prescribes as follows: "If such offer be not made, and the judgment in the appellate court be more favorable to the appellant than the judgment in the court below, or if such offer be made and not accepted, and the judgment of the appellate court be more favorable to the appellant than the offer of,* As to this offer, see pot, chap. cxxiy, art 6.,653
Costs on appeals from a justice's court. the respondent, the appellant shall recover costs. If the offer be made and accepted by the appellant, the appel. lant shall recover all his disbursements on appeal, and all his costs in the court below. But the appellant shall not recover costs except as provided in this chapter. The respondent shall be entitled to recover costs where the ap- pellant is not.,"Whenever costs are awarded to the appellant, he shall be allowed to tax, as part thereof, the costs and fees paid to the justice on making the appeal, as disbursements, in addition to the costs in the appellate court; and when the judgment in the suit before the justice was against such appellant, he shall further be allowed to tax the costs incurred by him which he would have been entitled to recover in case the judgment below had been rendered in his favor. 1," If, upon an appeal, a recovery for any debt or damages be had by one party, and costs be awarded to the other party, the court shall set off such costs against such debt or damages, and render judgment for the balance.,"The following fees and costs, and no other, except fees of officers, disbursements and witnesses' fees, shall be allowed on appeal to the party entitled to costs as herein provided, when the new trial is in the county court:,"For proceedings before notice of trial, ten dollars. " For all subsequent proceedings before trial, seven dol. lars.,"For trial of an issue of law, ten dollars. " For every trial of an issue of fact, fifteen dollars. "For argument of a motion for a new trial on a case of [or] bill of exception[s], ten dollars.,"In all cases, to either party, for every term, not ex- ceeding five, at which the appeal is necessarily on the calendar, and is not tried or is not postponed by the court, seven dollars.,"In other appeals the costs shall be as follows: To the

If th 'judgment ap- nealed from be reversed in part and affirmed as to the residue, the amount of costs allowed to either party shall be such sum as the appellate court may award, not ex- ceeding ten dollars. If the appeal be dismissed for want of prosecution, as provided by section 364, no costs shall be allowed to either party. In every appeal, the justice of the peace before whom the judgment appealed from was rendered, shall receive two dollars for his return. If theljudgment be reversed for an error of fact in the pro- ceedings, not affecting the merits, costs shall be in the discretion of the court. "If, in the notice of appeal, the appellant shall not state in what particular or particulars he claims the judg- ment should have been made more favorable to him, he shall not be entitled to costs unless the judgment appealed from be wholly reversed." The doubt which here arises is, whether term fees are chargeable on an appeal when no new trial is ordered. We think they are not, although the language of the sec- tion gives room for grave question as to the point. The appellate court has not now, as it had not before, any discretion as to costs (Garrison v. Pearce, 2 E. D. Smith, 262; Snyder v. Goodrich, id. 85; Mills v. Winslow, id. 18; Main v. Eagle, 1 id. 621; Hahn v. Van Doren, id. 411; Logue v. Gillic7, id. 398), except where the judgment is partly affirmed and partly reversed (Code, Â§ 371), or where it is reversed for an error of fact in the proceedings not affecting the merits. (Id.*) Appeal transferred into Supreme Court.]-When the county judge, being incapable of acting, transfers an appeal from a justice's court into the Supreme Court, the costs on the appeal are the same as are here stated.,* As amended, 1862.,655

COSTS ON SETTLEMENT BEFORE JUDGMENT. ARTICLEL. Costs against the defendant on settlement.,2. Costs on discontinuance. ART. 1.-Costs against the defendaitt, on settlement. On a settlement, before judgment, of any action men. tioned in Â§ 304, no greater sum can be demanded from the defendant as costs, than at the rates prescribed by Â§ 307. (Code, Â§ 322; as construed in Brace v. Beatty, 7 Abb.-445; Wilson v. Allen, sp. t., 4 How. 54.),Extra allowances.]--On settlement before judgment, in any of the actions specified in Â§ 308, the plaintiff, if enti. tled to costs, is entitled to one half the extra allowance granted in that section. (Code, Â§ 308.*),On such settlement, in any action specified in Â§ 304, no extra allowance can be granted under Â§ 309 to the plaintiff. (Brace v. Beatty, 7 Abb. 445; rev'g S. 0., 5 id. 221.),ART. 2.-Costs on discontinuance. As a general rule, the plaintiff will be required to pay costs upon discontinuing. (Marks v. Bard, 1 Abb. 63; Bedell v. Powell, 13 Barb. 185; Pignolet v. Deveau, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 584; M'IKenster ads. Van Zandt, 1 Wend. 13; Lewis v. Gerinond, 1 Paige, 300; see Cuinmins v. Bennet, 8 Paige, 81.),* As amended, 1862.
Before appearance of defendant.]-Under the former practice, no costs were allowed to a defendant who had not appeared in the action, even though he had retained an attorney before the plaintiff discontinued (Smith v. White, 7 Hill, 520; rev'g S. C., 4 id. 166), and after much consideration, we are of opinion that this is still the rule. The Code does not in any way treat the mere employment of an attorney as a proceeding in the cause, and it is only for "proceedings" that costs are allowed. There is no injustice to the defendant in such a rule, for his attor- ney may serve a notice of appearance immediately upon being retained, and thus secure his right to costs. The ,nly positive decisions upon the subject under the Code (F:ter v. Bowen, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 236; Weigan v. Beld, sp. t., 3 Abb. 462), both in the New York Common Pleas, are opposed to this view, but the former is founded solely upon the authority of the cases decided under the Revised Statutes in the Supreme Court, which were over- uled in Smith v. Whiite (supra), by the Court of Errors, and in the latter case, though the decision of the Court of Errors was examined and distinguished, yet no notice was taken of the fact that costs are only allowed for proceedings in an action. In all the other cases in which this decision of the Court of Errors has been noticed, it has been treated as applicable to our present system. (See Averill v. Patterson, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 500; 10 How. 85; Bedell v. Powell, 13 Barb. 183; Schecwk v. Fancher, p. t., 14 How. 95.) After appearance.]-Where an action was brought against several defendants, who put in a joint answer, and two of them made an offer of judgment under Â§ 385 of the Code, which the plaintiff accepted, he was allowed to discontinue as against the other defendant, without costs. (Stafford v. Onderdonk, 8 Barb. 99.) And where, by mistake, a wrong person was named as a defendant, who appeared in the action, though not served with the sum-,83,COSTS ON SETTLEMENT.,657
On diseontinuance. After appearane. mons, the plaintiff was allowed to discontinue without costs. (Waterbury Leather Manufacturing Co. v. Kratse 9 Abb. 175 2.; 1 Hilt. SCO.),Where one of several joint debtors is an infant, the plain. tiff may discontinue against him without costs, on appli. cation for leave to do so (Butler v. Morris, 1 Bosw. 329; Wellington v. Claason, sp. t., 9 Abb. 175), and so where all the defendants are infants, and, having obtained goods on credit, plead their infancy (Van Buren v. Fort, 4 Wend, 209), provided such application is made promptly after information of the defense; but if it is unreasonably delayed, costs will be imposed. (St. JTohn v. Hart, sp, t, 16 How. 192; see Cuyler v. Coats, sp. t., 10 How. 141.) The plaintiff is not, however, bound to accept the defend. ant's plea of infancy as true, but may, if he has reason to doubt it, go to trial, and the judge presiding at the trial may, in his discretion, allow him to discontinue with. out costs. (Butler v. Morris, 1 Bosw. 329.) It is obviou, however, that such delay is hazardous, and the plaintif should, therefore, inform himself if possible of the fact, without waiting for the trial.,Where an action is commenced on the authority of a previous decision, which is afterwards reversed or over. ruled, the court will allow the plaintiff, if he applies with. out unreasonable delay, to discontinue without costs (Sunney v. Roach, sp. t., 4 Abb. 16; Robinson v. Rosher, 1 Younge & Coll. Ch. 7.),If, after the commencement of the action, the defend. ant is sentenced to the state prison (Fort v. Palmerton, 19 Wend. 94; Lackey v. McDonald, 1 Caines, 116); or is discharged from his debts under an insolvent or bank. rupt law (Lee v. Phillips, 6 Hill, 246; Park v. Moore, 4 Hill, 592; Merritt ads. Arden, 1 Wend. 91), or is dis charged from imprisonment for his debts under an insol vency act (Honeywell v. Burns, 8 Cow. 121; LudloaoY. Hackett, 18 Johns. 252; Ashworth v. Wrigley, 1 Hall, 145; Hart v. Storey, 1 Johns. 143), the plaintiff will be allowed 658
-~CL- - On discontinuance. After appearance. to discon inue without costs, no matter what may be the frmn of the action (Merritt ads. Arden, 1 Wend. 91), and notwithstanding the defendant offers to stipulate not to plead the discharge (Honeywell v. Burns, 8 Cow. 121; Astskorth v. Wrigley, 1 Hall, 145; see Sandford v. Sin- clair, 6 Hill, 250), the ground of such permission being that such discharge is conclusive evidence of the defend- ant's inability to pay the judgment, if any is recovered against him, which objection is not removed by his wil- lingness to remove any legal obstacles to the recovery of jndgment. (Ib.) But the plaintiff will not be allowed to discontinue without costs on the ground of the defendant's insolv- ency, when the latter was discharged before the com- mencement of the action (see Case v. Belknap, 5 Cow. 422); unless the plaintiff shows clearly that he had no information of such discharge until after the action was commenced. (Smith v. Skinner, sp. t., 1 How. 122.) On the same principle, if the plaintiff proceeds in the action after information of the defendant's discharge, he must pay the costs thereby accruing. (Merritt ads. Arden 1 Wend. 91; Ludlow v. Haccett, 18 Johns. 252.) The mere fact of the defendant's insolvency is not sufficient ground for allowing a discontinuance without costs. The defendant must be actually discharged under a statute. (Collins v. Evans, 6 Johns. 333; see Case v. Blknap, 5 Cow. 422.) But if an order for the defendant's discharge has been obtained, although the discharge itself is not yet actually made out, that is sufficient ground for the application. (Park v. Moore, 4 Hill, 592.) If the defendant will give security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be obtained against him, the plaintiff will not be permitted to discontinue without costs, in cases where he otherwise would be. (Fort v. Palmerton, 19 Wend. 94.) In general, it seems that if the defendant takes any step which renders further proceedings on the part of the,659
On discontinuance. After appearance. Discretion of the court. plaintiff useless, the latter will be allowed to discontinue without costs. Thus, in an action of ejectment, the defendant having given up the premises to the plaintiff the latter was allowed this privilege (Jaclson v. Webb, cited, 1 Caines, 116); and so where the action was brought for equitable relief, and the defendant absconded from the jurisdiction of the court, and made relief impossible. (Knox v. Brown, 2 Bro. 0. 0. 186; 1 Cox, 359.) If, how. ever, the plaintiff has himself taken such proceedings as make it useless for him to continue the action, he will not be relieved from costs on that ground. (Hamrmerslej v. Barker, 2 Paige, 372.),If an executor or administrator, as such, commences a wrong action by mistake (Purdy v. Purdy, 5 Cow. 14; Philenix v. Hill, 3 Johns. 249), or finds that the action is useless (Arnoiw v. Steinbrenner, 1 Paige, 82), he will be allowed to discontinue without costs; unless he has acted in bad faith (Harris v. Jones, 3 Burr. 1451; see Phteniz v. Hill, 3 Johns. 249), which will not be presumed. (Phoenix v. Hill, supra.) And the same rule extends to any other trustee, suing as such. (Reeder v. Seely, 5 Cow. 548.),When the principal defendant in a foreclosure suit offers to settle with the plaintiff, the latter may discon. tinue without paying costs to the other defendants. (Gallagher v. .Egan, 2 Sands. 742.),Discretion of the court.]-The terms upon which an action may be discontinued as against one of several defendants are entirely discretionary with the special term, and cannot be made the subject of an appeal. (Waterburj Leather Mfg. Co. v. Krause, 9 Abb. 175 n.; 1 Hilt. 560.)

Costs against the estates of deceased persons. 3. Costs against infant plaintiffs. 4. Liability of the people for costs. 6. Liability of assignees pending suit. 6. Liability of attorneys for costs. ART. 1.-Liability of trustees for costs. In actions prosecuted by or against trustees of an ex- press trust, costs awarded against them are chargeable only on the property or persons that they represent, and not against such trustees personally, unless directed by the court to be paid by them personally for mispnanage- ment or bad faith in the action or defense. (Code, Â§ 317.),Wlio are trustees.]-Executors, administrators, persons expressly authorized by statute to sue or be sued on be- half of others (Code, Â§ 317), receivers (Devendorf v. Dick- inson. 21 How. 275; St. John v. Denison, sp. t., 9 id. 343; .Marclh v. Hussey, 4 Bosw. 614), assignees in trust for the benefit of creditors (Cunningham v. McGregor, 5 Duer, 648; 12 How. 305; Conger v. Hudsorn Riv. B. B. Co., 7 Abb. 255; Avery v. Smith, sp. t., 9 How. 349), though not where the assignment is void in law. (Sibell v. Remsen, 30 Barb. 441.) The president of a banking association,* and the president or treasurer of any association suing or sued on its behalf, are clearly within this provision. (See Cour- tois v. Harrison, 12 How. 361.) Wlhen trustee will be charged.]-A trustee of any kind must show by his complaint that he sues as such, or he will be personally liable for costs (Murray v. fendrickson, * Lowere v. Vail (sp. t., 5 Abb. 229), does not really decide the contrary. If it did, it would be erroneous.,661

(lb.),A receiver is personally liable for costs if he brings an action without leave of the court by which he was ap. pointed. (Smith v. Woodruff, sp. t., 6 Abb. 65; Phdps v. Cole, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 157.) But it is not necessary that he should state the fact of leave granted in his complaint.,Executors and administrators were formerly liable, in the discretion of the court, for costs upon claims against the decedent's estate, when they had unreasonably neg- lected or resisted them, after due presentation before suit, or had refused to refer them under the statute (2 R. S. 90, Â§ 41), but they are no longer personallyliable on those grounds (Code, Â§ 317), while, if the claim upon which an action formerly known as an action " at law " (Benedict v. Caffe, 3 Duer, 669; Yorkls v. Peck, sp. t., 9 How. 201) is founded, was not presented to them before the action was brought, and within the time duly specified by notice under the statute, they are not liable for costs, even though they conduct the defense in bad faith. (Beldet v. Knowlton, 3 Sands. 758; Code Rep. N. S. 127.),Prior to the Code, an executor or administrator was personally liable for costs in an action which he might have brought in his own right, though he sued in his representative capacity (Lyon v. Marshall, 11 Barb. 241; Burhans v. Blanchard, I Denio, 626; Reynolds v. Conin, 3 Hill, 441; People v. Albany Mayor's Ct., 9 Wend. 486); and though the later cases were decided under a section of the Revised Statutes, which left no room for doubt (2 R. S. 615, Â§ 17), but which was repealed by the Code. (Woodruff v. Cook, 14 How. 481), yet the earlier cases construed the former statute, which denied costs against executors in general terms, as referring only to actions necessarily brought by them in that capacity (Tilton v. Williams, 11 Johns. 403; Hollis v. Smith, 10 East, 293; see Ketchumr v. Ketchum, 4 Cow. 87); and it might be thought that the same construction should be put upon

But we apprehend that an executor, even when suing on a contract made with him for the benefit of the estate, acts as a trustee, and is therefore within the protection of the Code. Bad faith or mismanagement in respect to other matters than the action, is no ground for awarding costs against a trustee under Â§ 317. (Kimberly v. Patchin, sp. t., 22 How. 281.),Trustee, how charged.]-TNo costs can be charged against a trustee in any case, whether plaintiff or defendant, without an express order of the court. (Woodruffv. Cook, 14 How. 481.) And a judgment for costs against a trus- tee, entered without special leave, will be set aside as irregular.,Party rereesented.]-A judgment creditor cannot be charged with the costs of an action brought by a receiver appointed in supplementary proceedings under the judg- ment, unless such action was brought by his direction (McHarg v. Donelly, 27 Barb. 100; Wheeler v. Wright, sp. t., 14 Abb. 353), but if it was so brought, he is liable for the costs. (McHenc1 v. IMcench, 7 Hill, 204.) Where two co-executors sue as such, and fail, the fact that one of them was beneficially interested is not a ground for charging him with costs. (Finlay v. Jones, sp. t., 6 Barb. 229.),ART. 2.-Costs against the estates of deceased persons. In actions formerly known as "actions at law," brought against executors or administrators, no costs can be re- covered, even against the estates which they represent, unless by order of the court, upon its being made to appear that the demand on which the action was founded was presented to the defendants, within the time pre- scribed for the presentation of claims after due notice given, and that its payment was unreasonably resisted or,663

(2 B. 5. 90, Â§ 41.),The existence of any one of the alternatives mentioned in the statute entitles the plaintiff to costs. It is not neces. sary that they should co-exist. (Gor7am v. Ripley, sp. t, 16 How. 313; note to Bogardus v. Bullock, 1 Denio, 278.),This provision is continued in full force by Â§ 317 of the Code, so as not merely to exempt executors, &c., them. selves, but also the estates which they represent, from liability for costs in such cases. (Belden v. Knowltot, 3 Sands. 758; Code Rep. N. S. 127.),To what actions applicable.]-The Code does not extend this provision to equitable actions, but leaves the costs in such actions entirely to the discretion of the court. (Bene- dict v. Caffe, 3 Duer, 669; Yorks v. Peck, sp. t., 9 How. 201; see Sands v. Craft, 10 Abb. 216; 18 How. 438.),It has been held that this provision does not apply to actions commenced against persons in their lifetime and revived after their decease against their legal representa- tives (Mitchell v.

Bradley, 15 How. 79;11 and see Theriot v. Prince, sp. t., 12 id. 451.),Presfltation of clainm.]-No costs can be recovered if the claim, that is, the identical claim made in the action (Wal lace v. Markham, 1 Denio, 671), and the whole of it (Knapp v. Curtiss, 6 Hill, 386), is not presented to the executor or administrator of the estate before suit (Belden v. IKowl- ton, 3 Sands. 758; Code Rep.

Bogardus, 1 Denio, 276), and this, though the claim did not arise until after that period had expired (Bradley v. B3urwell, supra), if the plaintiff was in any sense a "creditor" of the estate. (Ib.) But the claim may be presented before the executor ad- vertises for claims (liRssell v. Lane, sp. t., 1 Barb. 519), and if then positively rejected, need not be again pre- sented. (Ib.) It is not necessary that the plaintiff's demand should have been verified by oath, when pre- sented, if the executor did not require it to be done. (Russell v. Lane, sp. t., 1 Barb. 519; Gansevoort v. Nelson, 6 Hill, 389.) The omission of an executor, &c., to advertise for claims, does not render either him or the estate liable for costs, nor excuse the plaintiff from presenting his claim before suit. (Fort v. Gooding, 9 Barb. 388; an YVleck v. Bur- roughs, 6 id. 341; Russell v. Lane, sp. t., 1 id. 519; Sny- der v. Young, sp. t., 4 How. 217; Comstock v. Olmstead, sp. t., 6 id. 77.*),Unreasonable resistance.]-The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that his claim was unreasonably re- sisted (Nicholson v. Slwweriman, 6 Wend. 554), and as a part of such proof, to show that the defendant had suffi- cient assets to pay his claim. (Bullock v. Bogardus, 1 Denio, 276.) A claim cannot be said to have been unreasonably re- sisted, if it is materially reduced on the trial (Buckhoult v. Hunt, sp. t., 16 How. 407; Cruiikshank v. Cruilkshank, sp. t., 9 id. 350; Comstock v. Olnstead, sp. t., 6 id. 77; Russell v. Lane, sp. t., 1 Barb. 519; Carhart v. Blais- dell, 18 Wend. 531; Wooden v. Bagley, 13 id. 453; Roberts v.

Estates of deceased persons. Refusal to refer. 278), even though the defendant offered no evidence (Lansing v. Cole, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 246); but a moderate reduction, not arising from a counterclaim, or the rejec tion of any separate item claimed, is not enough to ex. cuse the estate from costs. (Fort v. Gooding, 9 Barb. 388.),It is not unreasonable to resist a claim which the exe. cutor has good reason to suppose to be in whole or in part unfounded, even though that impression proves to be erroneous (Stephenson v. Cla/rk, sp. t., 12 How. 282; Coba stock v. Olmstead, sp. t., 6 id. 77), especially if he acts under the advice of counsel. (Prouide v. Whiton, 15 How. 304.),Unreasonable neglect.]-An executor or administrator is entitled to a reasonable time after presentation of the claim, for its examination, according to the nature of the case (Buckltout v. Hunt, sp. t., 16 How. 407; Stephen. son v. Clark, sp. t., 12 id. 282; Knapp v. Curtiss, 6 Eill, 386); and of course cannot be charged with neglect until the lapse of that time. (lb.) Three (Knapp v. Curtiss, supra) and even fifteen days were held insufficient for this purpose. (Buck7lout v. Hunt, supra; Stephenson v. Clark, supra.),Refusal to refer.]-It must appear affirmatively, in order to entitle the plaintiff to costs on this ground, that he offered to refer his claim (Proude v. Whiton, 15 How. 304; Buckhout v. Hunt, sp. t., 16 id. 407), and that too in con- formity to the statute (Stephenson v. Clark, sp. t., 12 How. 282), and that the defendant positively refused to do so. (Ib.; Knapp v. Curtiss, 6 Hill, 386.) The executor is entitled to a reasonable time to decide whether or not he will consent to a reference. (Ib.),An unqualified refusal to pay the claim, though unac companied with any offer on the part of the executor to refer, is not equivalent to a refusal to refer. (Proude v. Whiton, 15 How. 304; Buc7khout v. Hunt, sp. t., 16 id 412; overruling Fort v. Gooding, 9 Barb. 388.)
Estates of deceased persons. Costs against infant plaintiffs. An offer and refusal to arbitrate is not sufficient. (Cruikls7alk v. Cruiks7lanlc, sp. t., 9 How. 350; Swift v. Blair, 12 Wend. 278.) But the executor has no right to name all the referees, and if he insists upon doing so, this is equivalent to a refusal to refer. (Gor7lam v. Ripley, sp. t., 16 How. 313.) Costs, how allowed.]-Costs against the estate of a decedent can be allowed only upon the special order of the court (Mersereau v. Ryerss, sp. t., 12 How. 300; Weeks v. Wanmaker, sp. t., 2 id. 15; Knapp v. Curtiss, 6 Hill, 386; Winne v. Van Schaickc, 9 Wend. 448); and if taxed without such order, they will be stricken out on motion. (Snyder v. Young, sp. t., 4 How. 217; Weeks v. Wanmaker, supra.) IReferees have no power to allow such c sts. (Mersereau v. Ryerss, sp. t., 12 How. 300.) When the application for such costs is addressed to a judge who did not try the cause, a certificate should be procured from the judge who tried it, of such facts, ap- pearing at the trial, as have a bearing on the question (2 B. S. 90, Â§ 41; Parc7ill v. Hinman, sp. t., 12 How. 353); and when the cause was tried by a referee, his certificate should be obtained. (Mersereau v. Ryerss, sp. t., 12 How. 300.) But the certificate of even a judge, that the claim was "unreasonably resisted" or " neglected," &c., is not conclusive (Gansevoort v. Nelson, 6 Hill, 389; overruling Foot v. Gzatner, 12 Wend. 195), and such a certificate by a referee is wholly disregarded. (Buc7chout v. Hunt, sp. t., 16 How. 407; Comstock v. Olnstead, sp. t., 6 How. 77.) The certificate should report facts concerning the trial, and the facts proved at the trial, bearing on the question, for consideration. (Gansevoort v. Nelson, 6 Hill, 389.),AnT. 3.-Costs against infant plaintiffs. o When costs are adjudged against an infant plaintiff, the guardian by whom he appeared in the action is re-,667
Costs against infant plaintiffs. Liability of the people for costs sponsible therefor, and payment may be enforced by attachment. (Code, Â§ 316.),If there is a fund in court, belonging to the infant, the defendant's costs should be paid out of that (Waring v. Crane, 2 Paige, 79; Taner v. Ivie, 2 Ves. Sen. 466); though not unless the court is satisfied that the guardian brought the suit in good faith, with a sincere intent to benefit the infant (Pearce v. Pearce, 9 Ves. 547; Whitaker v. Marlar, 1 Cox, 285; see Waring v. Crane, supra), and after the exercise of reasonable care to ascertain his rights. (Semble, Waring v. Crane, supra.),If the court, during the infancy of the plaintiff, directs the action to be discontinued, as being adverse to his interests, the costs must be paid by his guardian. (Bowee v. Idley, 6 Paige, 53.),The guardian is not responsible for costs after the infant comes of age (Waring v. Crane, 2 Paige, 79), un. less the action was improperly brought, and the plaintiff electing to abandon it, takes no steps therein (ib.), and applies for a reference to decide that question. (Ib.),A plaintiff is personally responsible for costs, though he was an infant when the action was commenced, if on coming of age he assumes and continues it (Waringv. Crane, 2 Paige, 79), but, not if he refuses to proceed with it (Turner v. Turner, 1 Strange, 708), unless it was properly brought, in which case he must pay the costs of his guardian, as well as of the defendant, on discontinu- ance. (Anon., 4 Madd. 461.),It must be a very special case to justify the court in granting an extra allowance against an infant in any event. (Union Ins. Co. v. Rensselaer, 4 Paige, 85.),I ART. 4.-Liability of thepeople for costs. In all civil actions prosecuted in the name of the people of this State, by an officer duly authorized for that pur- pose, the people are liable for costs in the same cases and
Liability of the people for costs. Of assignees pending suit. to the same extent as private parties. If a private person is joined with the people as plaintiff, he is liable in the frst instance for the defendant's costs; which cannot be recovered of the people till after execution issued therefor against such private party and returned unsatisfied. (Code, Â§ 319.) In an action prosecuted in the name of the people of this State for the recovery of money or property, or to establish a right or claim, for the benefit of any county, city, town, village, corporation or person, costs awarded against the plaintiff are a charge against the party for whose benefit the action was prosecuted, and not against the people. (Code, Â§ 320.) The metropolitan police district is not included in any of the terms employed by Â§ 320. (People v. Tremain, sp. t., 17 How. 10.*) An extra allowance may be granted against the people of the state, suing as such, as well as against any private individual. (People v. Clarkce, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 349, 366; aff'g S. 0., 11 Barb. 337.),ART. 5.-Liability of assignees pending suit. In actions in which the cause of action, by assignment after the commencement of the action, or in any other manner, becomes the property of a person not a party to the action, such person is liable for the costs, in the same manner as if he were a party, and payment thereof may be enforced by attachment. (Code, Â§ 321.) An assignee in trust for the benefit of third persons is not, however, liable for costs under this provision, unless he is also liable under Â§ 317 of the Code. (Conger v. Hudson Riv. R. R. Co., 7 Abb. 255.) No one is liable for costs under this section, unless he would have been liable had the action been commenced by him. (Ib.),* Reversed on another point, 17 How. 142.,669
Liabilitity of assignees pending suit. Liability of attorney for ost. An assignee pending suit, when liable at all, is liable for all the costs of the action, before as well as after the assignment. (Jordan v. Sherwood, 10 Wend. 622; see Miller v. Franklin, 20 id. 630.),The Revised Statutes prescribed that any person " bene. ficially interested in the recovery" should be liable to an attachment for the costs in like manner. (2 B. . 619, Â§ 44.) And it is not clear that this provision is repealed by the Code, though it was intended to be superseded by the effect of Â§ 111, 317 and 321, taken together.,An assignee was not chargeable with costs under the Revised Statutes, if he did not in any way aid in prose. cuting the suit (Taylor v. Bolmer, 2 Denio, 193; W7itiney v. Cooper, 1 Hill, 629), and mere advice or inquiry about the suit, is not enough to make him liable. (Whitley v. Cooper, supra.) Mere knowledge that the action was continued, was not enough in any case to render him liable. (Taylor v. Bolmer, supra; qualifying Miller v. Franklin, 20 Wend. 630.) The application of these deci. sions to the Code may be doubtful, as the Revised Statutes only made one "bringing suit" in the name of another, liable for costs.,An' assignment by way of lien or mortgage was held to make the assignee liable for costs under the Revised Statutes (Whitejy v. Cooper, 1 Hill, 629), though a pledge of the amount to be recovered, and not of the cause of action itself, was not. (Miller v. Franklin, 20 Wend. 630.) It seems to us that, under the Code, a mere pledgee or lienor has not the " property " of the claim, so as to make him liable for costs.,ART. 6.-Liability of attorneys for costs. For non-resident clients.]-The attorney for a plaintiff who is not a resident of this state at the commencement of the action, or who, for any other reason, is bound to

In other cases. give security for costs,* is himself liable to the defendant for costs, to the extent of $100, until security for costs is filed pursuant to the statute. (2 R. S. 620, %Â§ 7, 8.) He may relieve himself from such liability, by filing security for costs, whether required by the defendant to do so or not. (Ib.) If the plaintiff resides in the state at the commence- ment of the action, the attorney does not become liable for costs by reason of his'client's removal from the state. (oong v. Hall, 3 Sands. 729; Code Rep. N. S. 115; Alex- ander v. Carpenter, 3 Denio, 266; Moir v. Brown, sp. t., 9 How. 270.) The defendant does not, by procuring an order that the plaintiff file security for costs, waive his right to require payment of costs from the plaintiff's attorney. The latter remains liable until security is actually filed. (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495.) This liability can be enforced by an execution against the property of the attorney (Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 How. 495), and in no other way. (Ib.) In other cases.l-An attorney who commences an action without authority, will be compelled to pay the defend- ant's costs. (Anon., 2 Cow. 589.) And even when duly retained, the attorneys are some- times required to pay costs incurred solely by their fraud or gross negligence.,* See on this subject, ante, p. 285.,671
By whom costs are adjusted. Interlocutory cost.,CHAPTER CVI. ADJUSTMENT OF COSTS. ARTICLE 1. By whom costs are adjusted.,2. Notice of adjustment. 8. The adjustment. 4. Appeal from adjustment. ART. 1.-By whobm COsts are adjusted. Final costs.]-Final costs are to be adjusted by the clerk (Code, Â§ 311) of the court in which the action is pending (Code, Â§ 466; Union Rubber Co. v. Babcock, 4 Duer, 620; 1 Abb. 262), and not of the appellate court, if an appeal has been had (ib.), except on an appeal from a justice's court or similar tribunal. In the Supreme Court, the clerk of the trial county is the proper officer. (See Code, Â§ 466.),The Court of Appeals does not interfere with the taxa- tion of costs in any case, except upon appeal from a regular proceeding in a court below. (Dresser v. Brooks, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 559; 4 How. 207.),Interlocutory costs.]-Formerly no officer had authority to adjust costs on motions, except by a power specially conferred in the order under which costs were taxed. (Tan Schaic7k v. Winne, sp. t., 8 How. 5; Nellis v. De Forest sp. t., 6 id. 413; Morrison v. Ide, sp. t., 4 id. 304.) But costs in any interlocutory proceeding may now be ad- justed by the judge before whom such proceeding was had, or the court in which the same [the action?] is pending, or in such other manner as such judge or court may direct. (Code, Â§ 311.*) Such adjustment is, we pre sume, to be conducted in like manner with an adjustment of final costs before the clerk.,* As amended, 1862.
Notice of adjustment. Time of notice.,ART 2.-N-otice of adjustment. Notice of the adjustment must be given by the pre- vailing party to the adverse party, -in like manner as other notices are served, except that five days' notice only is required, and, if the attorneys for all the parties reside in the same city, village or town, only two days' notice. (Code, Â§ 311.) With the notice, there must be served a copy of the items of costs and disbursements claimed (Code, Â§ 311),* which should be in substance a duplicate of the bill of costs. (See Shannon v. Browier, sp. t., 2 Abb. 377.) A defendant who has not appeared in the action is not entitled to any notice of adjustment (Code, Â§ 414), but if he has appeared, he is, even though he does not answer. (Id.; Elson v. Equitable Ins. Co., 2 Sands. 654; 2 Code Rep. 30; Dix v. Pabner, sp. t., 5 How. 233.) If the costs are not adjusted on the day noticed, the adverse party not attending, they may be adjusted on a subsequent day, without further notice. (Cooper v. Astor, 1 Johns. Cas. 32.) Time of wotice.]-Notice of adjustment of costs may be given before the right of the noticing party to recover them is established. (Anon., 4 Sands. 693.) It is sufficient if at the time of adjustment the moving party is entitled to them. (Ib.) Notice given in anticipation of a default is, therefore, regular if the default occurs. (Ib.; see Oothout v. Rooth, 12 Johns. 151.) As to whether a notice for adjustment on a Monday, served on the preceding Saturday, would be sufficient, see ante, i. 440.) Effect of omitting due notice.]-The effect of omitting to give due notice of adjustment of costs is to make the -As amended, 1857.

Notice. Effect of omitting notice. The adjustment. adjustment irregular, but not the judgment; and the judg. ment will be allowed to stand, though a retaxation of costs should be ordered. (Stimson v. Huggins, 16 Barb. 658; 9 How. 86; Potter v. Smith, sp. t., id. 262; Dix v. Palner, sp. t., 5 id. 233; Ric7cards v. Swetzer, sp. t., 3 id. 413; Tracy v. Humphrey, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 197; Goldsmith, v. Marpe, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 49; see Gilinartib v. Smith, 4 Sands. 684.*) And the party thus irregularly taxing costs may cure the error by giving notice of a re-adjustment, and paying costs of a motion. (Ib.; see Gra7iam's Pr., 2d ed., 338.),A-RT. 3.-The adjustment. The parties should appear before the clerk at the time and place indicated by the notice.,Objections to the form, time, or manner of notice, should be taken at the outset, or they will be waived.,If there are no preliminary objections, or if they are overruled by the clerk, the party giving the notice must present his bill of costs, with an affidavit verifying his disbursements. (Code, Â§ 311.),The power of the clerk to grant an adjournment has been doubted (Shannon v. Brower, sp. t., 2 Abb. 381), and with good reason, except where all parties consent.t If the clerk cannot attend to the matter on the day ap- pointed, a new notice must be given. (Bissell v. Dayton, sp. t., 2 How. 80.),The clerk should examine all the items charged, whether opposed or not, and strike out all charges for disburse- ments unnecessarily incurred. (Belding v. Conkllin, sp. t., 4 How. 199; see Stimson v. Huggins, 16 Barb. 662; 9 How. 90.),At a time when the fee bill was liberal, and when there * Elsor v. E~uitable Ins. Co.

Rogers, 2 Paige, 458.) Such a rule would seem too stringent, under the narrow allow- ances of the Code.,Bill of costs.]-The bill of costs should properly contain all the items taxed, in detail, including disbursements for witnesses, as well as for any other purpose. (Shannon v. Brower, sp. t., 2 Abb. 377.) It is not sufficient that the items are detailed in the affidavit. (Ib.; overruling Hagar v. Danforth, sp. t., 8 How. 448.) The bill of costs should therefore state separately the name of each witness, and the number of miles traveled by him, if travel fees are charged.,Affidavit.]-The bill of costs must be verified, as to the disbursements charged, by affidavit (Code, Â§ 311), which is usually made by the attorney for the successful party, and undoubtedly ought to be made by him or by his managing clerk, though it may be made by any one ac- quainted with the facts. (See Willink v. leckl7e, 19 Wend. 82.),When fees for the attendance of witnesses are charged, the affidavit (Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Toll v. Thomas, sp. t., 15 id. 315; Sleight v. Hancox, sp. t., 4 Abb. 245; Moore v. Cockroft, 9 How. 479; Ehle v. Bingham, 4 Hill, 595), must state the name (Wheeler v. Lozee; Toll v. Thonas; Elle v. Bingham), of each witness (ib.), and that he was a material (Wheeler v. Lozee, supra; Haynes v. Mosher, sp. t., 15 How. 216; Dean v. Williams, 6 Hill, 376), and necessary witness (ib.), for the party claiming to tax his fees (Haynes v. Mosher, supra; see Wheeler v.

Binlgham, 4 Hill, 595.),If travel fees of witnesses are charged, the affidavit must further state the place of residence (Hanna v. Dexter, sp. t., 15 Abb. 135; Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Toll v. Thomas, sp. t., 15 id. 315; E7de v. Bingham, 4 Hill, 595) of each witness (Wheeler v. Lozee, Hanna v. Dexter, Ehle v. Bingham, supra), the distance of his residence from the place of trial (lb.), according to the nearest usually traveled route (Hanna v. Dexter, Wheeler v. Lozee, supra), and the number of miles he actually traveled (Hanna v. Dexter, Wheeler v. Lozee, supra; laynes v. Mosher, sp. t., 15 How. 216; Toll v. Thomas, sp. t., id. 315; Logan.v. Thomas, sp. t., 11 id. 160; Moore v. Cock- roft, 9 id. 479; Scehermerhomr v. Fan Yoast, sp. t., 5 id. 458; Shufelt v.

Coc7croft, 9 How. 479.),If any witness is subpoenaed at a temporary residence, that fact should be stated (Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Clarks v. Staring, sp. t., 4 How. 243; Dowling v.

Bush, supra; Bank of Niagara v. Austin, 6 Wend. 548), unless he was about to return home when subpoenaed, and remains solely on account of his attendance being required at a future day (Pike v. Nash, sp. t., 16 How. 53), or does in good faith return home before the trial. (Ib.) Where increased travel fees are claimed on this account, the necessity of subpoenaing the witnesses away from home must be very plainly shown. (See Mead v. Mallory, sp. t., 27 How. 32.),When fees are claimed for a witness who was not sub- poenaed, the affidavit must state that he attended at the request of the party (Wheeler v. Lozee, 12 How. 446; Taaks v. Schmidt, sp. t., 25 id. 340), as his witness (ib.), and for the sole purpose of being witnesses (Taaks v. Schmidt, supra), and that they would not otherwise have attended. (lb.) It has been said that the affidavits of the witnesses themselves, to this effect, must be produced (ib.), but this seems a harsh requirement.,A clear case must be made to entitle the party to the fees of a witness not sworn on the trial (ib.; Haynes v. Mosher, sp. t., 15 How. 216; Dean v. Willians, 6 Hill, 376), the common affidavit not being sufficient in such case (ib.; see Toll v. Thonuas, sp. t., 15 How. 315); and very peculiar circumstances must be shown to justify a charge for a witness who did not attend the trial (Mead v. Mal- lory, sp. t., 27 How. 32; Dowling v. Bush, sp. t., 6 id. 410; see .Ehle v. Bingham, 4 Hill, 595), though such circum- stances may exist. (See Dowling v. Bush, supra; Clarks v. Staring, sp. t., 4 How. 243; Anon., 3 Hill, 457; Roth v. Meads, sp. t., 20 How. 287.),When witness fees are claimed for a party testifying in his own behalf, clear proof must be given that he attended only as a witness (Eanna v.

Baird, sp. t., 11 How. 377), or to show what occurred during the adjustment (People v. Oakes, sp. t., 1 How. 195), or to set up newly discovered evidence. (Schermerhorn v. Van Voast, sp. t, 5 How. 458.),Where it was objected that no sufficient proof had been given of the payment of the referee's fees, the court took into consideration the referee's receipt, given since the adjustment. (Toll v. Thomas, sp. t,, 15 How. 315.),T7te decision.]-In general, the court must set aside the taxation in so far as any error was committed by the clerk; but it will not interfere against a small disburse- ment, technically unnecessary, but incurred and allowed in good faith. (People v Colborne, sp. t., 20 How. 378.),The adjustment may be set aside as a matter of favor, in a proper case, although regularly made. Of course, this is usually done only upon payment of costs. (Peck v. Wood, sp. t., 2 How. 172.),Where an item of disbursements is stricken out on appeal, as unsupported by the affidavit before the clerk, leave to supply evidence of the disbursement will not be granted, without some excuse for its previous emission (Ball v.

All other deter- minations of the court giving any directions or rights are orders. (Code, Â§ 400.) There is not, under the Code, any such thing as an interlocutory judgment (Nolton v. Western B.

What is not a judgment. Judgment must be final 97), and a decision directing judgment on a demurrer after argument (ih7.; Phipps v. Van Cott, 4 Abb. 90;*r Ford v. David, 3 id. 385; 13 How. 193; 5 Duer, 684; Bentleyv. Jones, 4 How. 335; Ives v. Miller, 19 Barb. 196), or upon a demurrer or answer as frivolous (Hollister Bankl v. Fail, 15 N. Y. 593; Western B. R. v. Kortright, 10 How. 457; Lee v. Ainslie, 4 Abb. 463; 1 Hilt. 277),t or directing judgment for an amount to be ascertained upon an ac- counting (Lawrence v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co., 15 How. 57; see Tompkins v. Hyatt, 19 N. . 534; Chitten. den v. Missionary So. [Ct. of Appeals], 8 How. 327), or reserving any questions for further consideration (Tomp kins v. Hyatt, supra; Cruger v. Douiglass, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 571; 4 How. 215; Harris v. Clark, id. 78), even the mere question of costs (Chittenden v. Missionary So., 8 How. 327), is not a judgment, though a judgment may be subsequently entered thereon.,There has been much confusion upon this subject, arising principally on questions concerning the appeala. bility of orders directing final judgment. But we are clearly of opinion that, as it is said by BOSWORTH, 0. J. (15 How. 57), the word "judgment" has the same mean. ing wherever it is used in the Code, and, therefore, that every direction which cannot be regarded as a judgment for all purposes under the Code, is not a "judgment" at all,* Overruling Lewis v. Acker (8 How. 414), decided in the same district t To the contrary is Bruce v. Pinckney (8 How. 397), and some cases at special term. 682

Judgment must be founded on the pleadings.]-It was a strict rule under the old practice, both at law (Ct. of Errors, Addington v. Allen, 11 Wend. 374), and in equity (Bailey v. Ryder, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld. ]363; Ct. of Errors, Jaes v. M'Kernon, 6 Johns. 543, 559; Tripp v. Yincent, 3Barb. Ch. 1. 613; Jones v. Grant, 10 Paige, 348; Ward v. Daris, 3 Sands. 510; see Forsyth v. Clark, 3 Wend. 637; Pidd v. Mayor of N. Y., 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 189), that udgment could not be rendered upon any grounds (i. e., upon consideration of any facts) not set up by the pleadings; and this is still the rule under the Code (IWight v. Delafield, 25 N. Y. 266; Brazill v. Is7utm, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 17; Robbins v. Rictardson, 2 Bosw. 25; see lM'yring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297), though more liberal rules prevail as to the construction of pleadings, and as to regarding amendments as made, where merely chnical allegations are wanting. (See Lounsbtrryv. Purdy, 1N. Y. 515; Bennett v. J.udson, 21 N. Y. 238; Cardell v.,7eil, id. 336.) Even under the old practice, it was not ecessary that the judgment should conform precisely to the pleadings-it was merely required to be within the general scope of the issue.

(Wright v. Hooker, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld] 51; see Emerl y v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62.),Legal and equitable relief.]-The distinction between legal and equitable actions being abolished (Code, 5 69), such judgment is to be granted in every species of action, as, taking into consideration all the principles of law and equity applicable to the case, may be proper. (N. Y. Cen. tral Ins. Co. v. National Pro. Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. 85; Crary v. Goodman, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 266.) The same relief i now to be granted in one action that would formerly have been granted through the medium of two actions, one at law and one in equity, in relation to the same matter (Blair v. Claxton, 18 N. Y. 529; Phillips v. Gorhamn, 17 l Y. 270; Crary v. Goodman, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 266; Do. son v. Pearce, id. 156; 1 Abb. 97; Laub v. Bitcknmier, 17 N. Y. 626; Hannay v. Pell, 4 E. D. Smith, 428; Footy. Sprague, 12 How. 355; see Gridley v. Gridley, 24 N.Y. 136; Cole v. Reynolds, 18 id. 74); and whether the action is one formerly known as legal or as equitable, the same rules are to be applied in all cases, and relief is to be administered without any regard to such distinction (Ib.; Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Despard v. Walbridge, 15 id. 374; see Barlow v. Scott, 24 id. 40; N. Y. Ice Co, v. Northwester Ins. Co., 23 id. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296.),As it was one of the chief purposes of equity to modif and control the operation of the common law, and to deprive men of privileges which that law conferred upon them against conscience, it follows that wherever the principles of law and of equity come into collision, the former are to be regarded as abolished by the Code (See Despard v. Walbridge, 15 N. Y. 374.) In effect, e think that every action is now to be regarded as an equl 684
Belief to plaintiff. Where there is no answer. able one, and every court of record as at all times, and for all purposes, a court of equity.,ART. 2.-Relief to ilaintiff. There is a very important difference between the mea- sure of relief which may be granted to the plaintiff against a defendant who answers the complaint, and that which he may have against one who does not answer. Where there is no answer.]-The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that which he has demanded in his complaint. (Code, Â§ 275.) It is clearly the intent of the Code that the plaintiff in such case shall not have any other relief than that which he has asked, though he may have less, provided it is of the same species- Thus, where the complaint demanded judgment for $2,000 in money, and the surrender of notes to the amount of $5,000, a judgment taken on failure to answer, for $7,000 in money, was held erroneous. (Hiurd v. Leavenuorth, Code Rep. N. S. 278.) And under a com- plaint demanding a specific piece of land, the plaintiff could not take judgment for a chattel, even though it were of much less value. So in an action for special relief, the judgment could not vary in the least degree from the prayer of the complaint. The reason is obvious. The defendant, by omitting to answer, admits the plaintiff's right to the judgment he asks, and consequently to all that is necessarily included in it. But if he had notice that another species of relief was sought, he might desire, and he able, to resist the plaintiff's demand. If, there- fore, the plaintiff desires any other relief than that which he has demanded, he must waive the default, and amend his complaint. A defendant who does not answer is entitled to the benefit of this provision, notwithstanding his co-defend- ants do, and the plaintiff can have no other judgment against him than what he has demanded in his complaint.,685
Relief to plaintiff. After answer An error in this respect is not, we think, ground for an appeal; but the judgment should be vacated on motion, as irregular and unauthorized. (SimoVtso,1 . Blake, 12 Abb. 331; Bullwinkler v. Ryker, sp. t., id. 311.),After answer.]-When an answer is put in, the court may grant the plaintiff any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint, and embraced within the issue. (Code, Â§ 275.),If the defendant answers, the demand of relief in the complaint becomes immaterial. (Mlarquat v. Marquat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336.) The facts pleaded are alone to be considered, and the court is to give such judgment in favor of the plaintiff as these entitle him to, even though it be radically different from that demanded in the com. plaint (ib.; Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y 40; New York Ice Co, v. Nortl7hestern Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296; Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Denmtan v. Prince, 40 Barb. 213), and without any regard to the dis. tinctions between legal and equitable relief (ib.), or to the theory upon which the complaint is framed (Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; Wright v. Hooker, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld] 51; compare Hotop v. Neidig, 17 Abb. 332); and though it contains no prayer for general relief. (Emery v. Pease, supra.*) The court not only smay, but must do so. (En. ery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; see Barlow v. Scott, and other cases supra.),If the case stated by the complaint, by which is meant the statement of the plaintiff's right, and the defendant's infringement thereon (Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y. 40; Mar. qtat v. Mlfarquat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336), entitles the plaintiff to any remedy, whether legal or equitable, hih complaint cannot be dismissed merely because he has,* In Marquat v. Mdarguat (12 N. Y. 336), the complaint contained suchi prayer# but no notice was taken of itby the court. 686
Belief to plaintiff. After answer. Relief to defendant. prayed for a judgment to which he is not entitled. (Emery v. Pease, 20 N. Y. 62; and see cases cited supra.) Such relief must, however, be asked at the trial, for the court is not bound to discover of itself what relief is needed. And it must be granted only in such manner as to avoid an inequitable surprise upon the defendant. Therefore, in an action for unliquidated damages, the plaintiff will not be allowed to retain a verdict for a larger sum than he asked in his complaint (see Corning v. Corning, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 97), even by amending his complaint to conform thereto. (Ib.) For it is obvious that the defendant might have prepared additional evi- dence in mitigation of damages, had he known that he was liable to be so severely mulcted. But in an action of debt, in which every item has been contested, and the defendant has not been either surprised or misled, the plaintiff should be allowed to retain a ver- dict for all that he proves, though it be for an amount larger than the complaint demanded. (Davis v. Smith, 14 How. 187.) Possibly there may be cases in which, "legal" relief onlybeing asked by the complaint, and "equitable" relief sought upon the trial, the defendant might be deprived of an opportunity to procure evidence showing that the plaintiff, by reason of inequitable conduct, or otherwise, ought not to have equitable relief. Such cases must, however, be rare, and upon proper proof of the circum- stances the trial would be postponed to enable the defend- ant to meet the case. (See See v. Partridge, 2 Duer, 463.),AET. 3.-Relief to defendant. The court may* grant to the defendant any affirmative relief to which he may be entitled (Code, Â§ 274), provided *"`May" is here doubtless equivalent to "must." (See Macdougal v. Paeraon, 11 C. B. 755; C~ak v. Powed, 2 EL & BL 210.),687
Relief to defendant. Relief as between co-defendanta. his right thereto appears by the pleadings, as well as the evidence, if any. (Delafield v. Wright, 25 N. Y. 266.),Although the Code is not explicit on the subject, we are satisfied that the same rules apply to the granting of relief to a defendant, as in the case of a plaintiff after answer served; and that he should be allowed such relief as the facts pleaded entitle him to, though not specially demanded. (See Martin v. Lott, sp. t., 4 Abb. 365.) But in analogy to a complaint, if a counterclaim is not replied to, the defendant should have no other relief under his counterclaim than that specifically demanded by his answer.,Affirmative relief cannot be granted to a defendant, in an action in which parties necessary to the adjudication of the question raised by his counterclaim are wanting (Cnmmings v. Morris, 25 N. Y. 625; Smith v. Howard, sp. t., 20 How. 151); but we think the defendant is in such case entitled to have the necessary parties brought in if such relief is necessary to avoid injustice to him.,Negative relief.]-In the majority of cases, the defendant requires only negative relief, i. e., protection from an un- just claim. This may consist either in a bare dismissal of the complaint, leaving the plaintiff to sue again if so disposed, or in a final judgment that the plaintiff is not entitled to his demand, barring him from a new action.,ART. 4. Belief as between co-defendants. It sometimes becomes necessary, in actions for special relief, to determine the relative rights of the defendants as between each other, before full relief can be given to the plaintiff without doing injustice to them. This was constantly done in chancery, and at one time was carried to such an extent as to cause serious delay to plaintiffs in foreclosure suit (see Tower v. White, 10 Paige, 395), for which reason the practice was modified. (lb.),The Code authorizes the court in all cases to determine 688
Relief as between co-defendants. the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as between themselves* (Code, Â§ 274), and to grant to the defendant affirmative relief. (Ib.) There is no question as to the application of the first clause, but it has been doubted whether the latter clause warrants any judgment in favor of one defendant against another (see Mechanics' &c. Inst. v. Roberts, sp. t., 1 Abb. 381), and an answer claiming such relief was stricken out inlfoocdwort7l v. Bellows (sp. t., 4 How. 24). It has also been held that no relief should be granted in favor of a defendant against a co-defendant who had not appeared in the action. (Norbury v. Seeley, sp. t., 4 How. 73.) The actual decisions in each of the cases cited may be sustained on the merits, without admitting their au- thority on these points. In the first case, a measure of relief was asked on motion, clearly luwarrantable on the facts shown, within the principles of equity on this sub- ject. In the other cases, it was sought to extend the practice to a class of cases in which it was never used, and to which it mnay be inapplicable, though we doubt it. It was the settled practice in equity, to allow a decree between co-defendants based on the pleadings and proofs. (Chamley v. Dunsany, 2 Sch. & Les. 710; Conry v. Caul- jld, 2 Ball & B. 255; see Jones v. Grant, 10 Paige, 348; Eiott v. Pell, 1 Paige, 263; Rcnwick v. Macomnb, Hopk. 277.) The Court of Appeals has recognized the former prac- tice in equity as still in existence under the Code, and sanctioned a proceeding which seems to us clearly a case of affirmative relief in favor of a defendant against his co-defendants. (Livingston v. Mildrum, 19 N. Y. 440.) In that case the plaintiff had procured an order for the sale * The court is not bound to do so without such relief being asked on the trial, nor are the defendants estopped from asserting their respective rights against each other by omitting to set them up in this manner. (Decker v. Juon, 16 N. Y. 439.),87,689
Relief as between co-defendants. of so much only of certain property as would satisfy his mortgage on the whole. One of the defendants, a sub- sequent lienor, applied to the court for a sale of the whole property, in order to protect his interest, which would otherwise be endangered, and it was ordered accordingly. The court held the order valid, and expressly decided that no notice of such proceedings need be given to defendants who did not appear in the action.,The continued existence of this practice has been re- cognized in other cases (see Wells v. Smith, sp. t., 7 Abb. 261; Tracy v. Steam Faucet Co., 1 E. D. Smith, 349; Bogardus v. Parker, sp. t., 7 How. 305), though with a decided intimation that it should not be extended to new cases under the Code. (Wells v. Smith; Tracy v. Steam Faucet Co., supra.),We cannot but doubt the propriety of limiting these express provisions of the Code to any class of actions. So long as proper notice is given to all parties, we cannot see why, on an action against a maker and indorser of a note, the rights of all parties should not be settled at once; which might be done by framing a side issue between the defendants, and awarding thereon judgment in favor of the indorser against the maker for such amount as he might pay into court for the plaintiff,When such relief is granted in an action for ordinary relief, the parties between whom the controversy arises should be allowed to seve statements in the nature of pleadings between themselves. (DrIo, J., Decker v. Jud- son, 16 N. Y. 439.),Relief as between co-defendants cannot bo granted in respect to matters not immediately connected with the subject of the action (Morrice v. Sandford, 11 Cl. & Fin. 667; 8 Jur. 967; Elliott v. Pell, 1 Paige, 263), as if they arise partly out of transactions between the defendants occurring during the progress of the action, and not pleaded or pleadable, even though relating to the pro-

(Jones v. Grant, supra; Elliott v. Pell, 1 Paige, 263.) But it does not appear to be essential that the defendant's claim against his co-defendants should be raised by his answer. (See Livingston v. Mildrutm, 19 N. Y. 440; Jones v. Grant, 10 Paige, 348.),ART. 5.-Severance of parties on judgment. Judgynent for parties on each side.]--Judgment may be given for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, or of several defendants. (Code, Â§ 274.),When an action being brought against several defend- ants as jointly liable, it appears upon the trial that some of them are liable, and others not, judgment should be awarded against the former, and in favor of the latter; and this in actions upon contract (Prulyn v. Black, 21 N. Y. 300; Brumskill v. James, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 294; Marquat v. Marquat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336; MeKensie v. Farrell, 4 Bosw. 192; Denman v. Prince, 40 Barb. 213; Witherhead v.

Cram, 8 How. 151; overruling Ful- lerton v. Taylor, sp. t., 6 How. 259), as well as in actions upon wrongs (Wagener v. Bill, 19 Barb. 321), and for the recovery of specific property. (Woodbitrt v. Clhamberlin, 17 Barb. 446.) Of course there never was any doubt as to the propriety of such a judgment where the parties' rights or liabilities were several.,So in an action brought by several plaintiffs on a claim which they allege to belong to them jointly, but which appears to belong to one of them alone, judgment must be rendered in his favor, and against the others. (Cowles v. Cowles, 9 How. 361.) And the defendant, in an action brought by several plaintiffs jointly, may show that one of them is sole owner of the claim, and,691

(Ib.),It was the intention of the Code to abrogate the rule of the common law that where a joint contract was alleged, no recovery could be had on proof of a contract by less than all the parties. (Brumskill v. James, 11 N. . [1 Kern.] 294; Witherhead v. Allen, 28 Barb. 661; Cowles v. Cowles, 9 How. 361.),The power thus conferred is not discretionary. A refusal to exercise it in the proper cases is a ground of exception and appeal. (See People v. Cram, 8 How. 151; Cowles v. Cowles, 9 id. 361.) And the limitation of subd. 3 of Â§ 274 to cases in which a several judgment may be proper, does not apply to this provision. (Ib.),Judgmen)t against one defendant, leaving action to proceed.] In an action against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others whenever a several judgment may be proper. (Code, 2 274, sbd. 3.),The plaintiff cannot avail himself of this provision without leave of the court (Bacon v. Comstockc, sp. t., 11 How. 197); but such leave may be granted in any mode, a formal order upon motion expressly for this purpose not being necessary. (See Witherhead v. Allen, 28 Barb. 661.),The plaintiff, in an action upon a joint liability, cannot enter judgment as of course against a defendant who fails to answer, until all the defendants are in default, or a trial and decision had. (Sliyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673; Catlin v. latson & Billings, sp. t., 4 Abb. 248; 13 How. 511; Bacon v. Comstock, sp. t., 11 id. 197; Jacques v. Greenr wood, sp. t., 1 Abb. 230; see Blodget v. Morris, 14 N. Y. 491.) The court may, however, allow such a judgment to be entered without waiting for a default or trial as to the other defendants, and leaving the action to proceed against them. (Witherhead v. Allen, 28 Barb. 661.)

(See ante, i. 422, Â§ 42.),It should state the term of the court, as whether a special or general term, or a circuit, at which the judg- ment was ordered, the place at which it was actually held (Old Chancery Rule 98), and the date at which it was actu- ally entered (Barclay v. Brown, 7 Paige, 245; see Whitney v. Belden, 4 id. 140), unless it was ordered to be entered nuno pro tune, in which case that fact should be stated, and the day of actual entry must appear in some part of the judgment. (Barclay v.

If the judgment is taken by default, without applying to the court, the caption may either state the judgment as of a special term, held that day, naming the judge sitting at that term, or it may omit everything of the kind, and give simply the date and place of entry of judgment.,A judgment entered upon the report of a referee should be entitled as if it had been entered at a special term, before a justice of the court. (Hancock v. Hancock, 22 N. Y. 568.),Recitals.]-When the judgment is taken by default for want of an answer, it seems proper to give a brief reca- pitulation of the steps taken to acquire jurisdiction, and to give regularity to the proceedings, though it is not essential; and of course no omissions in such statement will affect the validity of the judgment. (Quarrier v. Carter, 4 Hen. & Munf. 242.),When a trial has been had on the defendant's pleadings, the fact or mode of summoning the defendant is entirely immaterial, forming no part of the record (Smitlh v. Holmes, 19 N. Y. 271); and no allusion should be made to it by the judgment. It is enough to say that the cause was heard on the pleadings, specifying them. It may be well to state that the parties attended the trial of the cause. (See Chemung Canal Bank v. Jtudson, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld] 254.),In a judgment for the defendant, the recitals may be important, as showing whether it ought to bar a new action for the same cause, or not. In such a judgment, it ought to appear whether the cause was decided upon the merits, whether it was submitted to the jury, if any, or whether the complaint was dismissed without any con- clusive decision of the controversy. (See post, p. 698.),The recitals in a judgment are conclusive evidence against a party appearing in the action, who makes no

Married women. Infants. Judgment for defendart, It has been said that such a judgment should contai a direction that it be collected out of the defendant's separate estate and not otherwise. (Baldwiin v. dimdl, 16 Abb. 353.) We cannot see, however, what good (or harm) is to be accomplished by such a clause.,Infants.]-A judgment for special relief against an infant must give him a day to show cause against it after coming of age (Wright v. Miller, 1 Sands. Oh. 103; approved, S. C., 4 Barb. 611; 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 18; Harris v. Youman, Hoffmn. 178; Mills v. Dennis, 3 Johns. Ch. 367; Bicshnell v. Harford, 4 id. 301), which is usually fixed at six months after that period. (Ib.) In the absence of such a clause, the infant may obtain relief from the judgment, on showing it to be erroneous, even though it be not fraudulently obtained (ib.), subject to no restric tion as to time, other than the statute of limitations.,This rule does not apply, however, to proceedings which are decided by the court to be for the infant's benefit (Mills v. Dennis, 3 Johns. Ch. 367); even though the action be in the main adverse to the infant. (lb.),These rules were never adopted by courts of law, and therefore it may well be doubted whether they are now to be applied to actions for ordinary relief.,ART. 2.-Jsudgment for defendant. Judgment for the defendant may be either by way of conclusive adjudication on the merits of the controversy, or may simply turn the plaintiff out of court, leaving him free to renew his action at another time.,In equity, a dismissal was in general a bar to a new action (Burhans v. Yan Zandt, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 523; Ogsbuwr v. Lafarge, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 113; Lansing v. Russell, 13 Barb. 510; Holmes v. .Rensen, 7 Johns. Oh 286); while at law a nonsuit was not such a bar.,Inasmuch as the Code substitutes a dismissal of the complaint for a nonsuit, there was some doubt at first 698
Judgment for defendant. When a bar to new action. whether a dismissal did not amount to a bar in all actions, but it is well settled that in "legal" actions it is not, when granted in lieu of a nonsuit (Dexter v. Clark, 35 Barb. 271; 22 How. 289; Coit v. Beard, 33 Barb. 357; 12 Abb. 462; 22 How. 2; Harrison v. Wood, 2 Duer, 50); while in "equitable" actions, it seems to be held a bar. Bostwick v. Abbott, 40 Barb. 331.) It is much to be regretted that any such distinctions should be raised between these classes of actions, with- out the most absolute necessity. It is the duty of the courts to establish uniform rules for all actions, wherever it is possible. In this case there is little difficulty. The reason of the distinction formerly existing between a dismissal and a nonsuit was substantially that the former was an actual adjudication upon the merits, while the latter was in its origin a mere voluntary discontinuance. It was by an innovation on the English practice that our courts granted a nonsuit without the plaintiff's consent. (See ante, p. 477 ) The true principle, in our opinion, and one which should, under the Code, be applied to all actions indis- criminately, is, that when a cause is submitted to a jury, if tried before one, or in other cases to a judge or referee, upon the merits, and decided upon the merits, that decision should be a bar to a new action for the same cause. (See Burhans v. Van Zandt, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 523; Hamilton Asso. v. Reynolds, 5 Duer, 671.) If the issue is taken from the jury, that should be conclusive evidence that it was not decided upon the merits, although in some cases it may not be the fact. The defendant should be required to submit the cause to the jury, or to waive his right to an absolutely final decision.,699

Jadgments for money. Judgments in actions for lands.,ART. 3.--Judgments for money. There should be only one judgment for money in any action. If the plaintiff recovers damages, and the de- fendant costs, the amounts tlus adjudged must be set off against each other, and a judgment rendered in favor of the party to whom the balance is due, for such balance. (,Johlison v. Farrell, 10 Abb. 384; Crim v. Cronkhite, sp. t., 15 How. 250; Canfield v. Gaylord, 12 Vend. 236.),Â§ 301.

(See ante, i. 387.),ART. 4.-Jutdgments in actions for lands. In an action for land, the judgment, if for the plaintiff, must be that the plaintiff recover the possession of the premises, according to the verdict of the jury, if there was such verdict; or if the judgment is taken by default, according to the description of the premises contained in the complaint. (3 1. S. (5th ed.) 595; [2 id. 308].) It may also include such damages as are assessed by the verdict or otherwise. * For a variety of forms, see Book of Forms, Nos. 279 to 287.,701

Judgments in actions for chattela If the plaintiff's title has in any way terminated dur. ing the pendency of the action, whether by its own limi. tation or by his own act (Lang v.

Judgmentfor recovery of land upon a verdict.* [Title of cause.] [ Caption.],This action having been brought to a trial by jury, and a verdict therein rendered for the plaintiff, it is now, on motion of [&e.] adjudged that the plaintiff recover possession of the real property described in the verdict [and also ........ dollars damages for the withholding thereof] [and also ........ dollars for the rents and profits thereof], with ........ dollars costs of the action, making together ........ dollars.,ART. 5.-Judgments in actions for chattels. For plaintiff.]-In an action for chattels, the judgment, if in favor of the plaintiff, and if he has, during the pendency of the action, obtained possession of the pro- perty, may be that he retain possession thereof and recover damages for its detention. (Code, Â§ 277.),If he has not obtained possession of the property, the judgment may be that he recover possession thereof, or its value, in case a delivery cannot be had, with damages for its detention. (Code, Â§ 277.) The judgment in such case must be in the alternative. The plaintiff cannot elect to take judgment for the value of the property absolutely. (Fitzhuglb v. Wiman, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 559;t see Wood v. Orser, 25 N. Y. 348, 355.),* For other forms, see Book of Forms, Nos. 294 to 300. See also various forms of recitals, ante, pp. 695 to 697. t Commercial Bank v.

Judigment for delivery of chattels to plaintiff uipon a verdict.* [Tidle of catse.] [ Caption.] This action having been brought to a trial by jury, and a verdict rendered therein for the plaintiff [and the property claimed having been taken into the plaintiff's possession], [and the value of the property claimed, and damages for the detention thereof, having been assessed by a jury, under the direction of the court], it is now, on motion of [&c.] adjudged that the plaintiff recover [or retain] possession of the said property [or ....... dollars, the value thereof, in case a delivery cannot be had], and also recover ........ dollars [damages, with ........ dollars] costs of the action. For defendant.]-In a similar action, a judgment in favor of the defendant should, if the property has been delivered to the plaintiff, and the defendant claims a return thereof, award such return, or the value of the property, in case a return cannot be had, with damages for taking and withholding the same. (Code, Â§ 277.) This judgment also must be in the alternative form, and the defendant cannot elect to take judgment for the value only. (Dwight v. Enos, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 470; Glann v. Yolnglove, 27 Barb. 480; Seaman v. Luce, 23 id. 240.) The form given for judgment against the defendant will answer equally well for a judgment in his favor, changing the word "plaintiff" into "defendant," wher- ever it occurs. Lienor.]-The judgment is the same, even if the suc- cessful party is a mere lienor (Dows v. Rush, 28 Barb. 187); unless the adverse party is the general owner, in,For other forms, see Book of Forms, Nos. 288 to 293. See also various forms of recitals, ante, p. 695.,703

Judgment for surrender of a document. which case, if the latter is in possession, the proper form of judgment in favor of the lienor is that he recover pops session, or if that cannot be had, then the value, not exceeding the amount due to him under his lien. (Fitzhugh v. Wimca,, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 559; Seamla v. Intce, 23 Barb. 240; see Dows v. Greene, 24 N. Y. 646.),If the property has not been taken from the defendant during the litigation, the judgment in his favor is of course in the ordinary form for costs only.,ART. 6.--Judg)wts for special relief. We are reluctantly compelled to omit the forms of judgment in actions of foreclosure, partition, dower, di- vorce, &c., from mere want of space.,When a judgment for special relief requires the per- formance of any act by a party (as, for example, the execution of a deed), it should include an explicit order that such party perform such act. (Fero v. Van Evra, sp. t., 9 How. 148.),A judgment directing the execution of a deed by a party, ought to provide for the settlement of its form before a judge or referee. (Hilliker v. Hathorne, sp. t., 5 Bosw. 710.),Â§ 305. Judgment for surrender of a document. [Recitals as in Â§Â§.291 to 297.],It is now on motion of [cÂ£c.] adjudged: 1.

(Rule 56, Sup'reme Ct.),Who slwild enter judgment.]-It is the right and duty of the party succeeding on the main issue to enter judg- ment. Thus, if the plaintiff recovers a verdict, though it be so small as to entitle the defendant to costs, which exceed the verdict, it is nevertheless the plaintiff's duty to enter judgment. (Sorbes v. Meigs, 3 Wend. 308.) If the party whose duty it is to enter judgment will not do so, the adverse party may, by motion, compel him to do,89
General rules. Who should enter. Entry nunc pro tune. it (Purdy v. Peters, sp. t., 15 Abb. 160; 23 How. 328; Anon., sp. t., 1 How. 200; see Canfield v. Gaylord, 12 Wend. 236; Bank of Geneva v.

Cady, 6 Hill, 265; see Hoyt v. Blain, 12 Wend. 189.),If the defendant in such a case enters the judgment without leave, it will not be set aside (l(nncll v. Grifin, sp. t., 8 Abb. 39), though he should ordinarily be charged with costs of the motion as a condition of allowing it to stand. (See Frisbic v. Biley, 12 Wend. 248.),When to be entered.I]-Unless otherwise ordered by the court, judgment may be entered at once upon a final decision of the cause. (Droz v. Lakey, 2 Sands. 681; Lynde v. Couienihoven, 4 How. 327.),No judgment can be entered against a party until all the issues raised by him have been decided. ( M'Mahon v. Allen, 27 Barb. 335; 7 Abb. 1; Blkunap v. Ml3cIntyre, sp. t., 2 Abb. 366; Masters v. Barnard, sp. t.,6 How. 113; Sutherl1and v. Tyler, sp. t., 11 How. 251.) Therefore, if a defendant raises an issue of law and an issue of fact, both must be decided before judgment can be entered (Belknap v. 1Mclintyre; Sutherland v. Tyler; Masters v. Barnard, supra); or if an accounting is ordered, it must be taken before judgment can be entered. (.1McMahon v. Allen, supra; see Lawrence v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co., 15 How. 57.),Entry nulnc pro tune.I]-When a party to an action has died after the trial and before judgment, the court will enter judgment 7nunC pro tune, as of the time of trial.

(Ib.),It scems that a judgment will not be entered nuiwt pro tuine as of the day of trial, merely to enable the success- ful party to recover costs under a statute repealed between the trial and judgment. (Moore v. Westervelt, 14 How. 279.),On whose direction entered.]-Elxcept in those cases in which a different course is specially prescribed, judgments in litigated cases are to be entered only upon the direction of a single judge in court, or upon the report of referees. (Code, Â§ 278.),Judgmlenltfor special relief.]-WVhen judgment is ordered for any special relief, the successful party should prepare a draft of the judgment in conformity with the decision, and serve a copy thereof upon his opponent, with a notice of the time and place of settlement.,There is no fixed rule as to the length of notice required, but two days are usually considered sufficient.,A judgment for special relief, entered without such settlement, or without consent, will be set aside on motion. (Wood v. Lambert, 3 Sands. 724.),ART. 2.--Judgment eon verdict. The clerk must enter judgment in conformity with a verdict, unless otherwise directed by the court (Code, Â§ 264; Morrison v. N.

Judgment on verdict. Judgment on trial by the court. Where exceptions are ordered to be heard by the general term in the first instance (Matter of Welch, sp. t., 14 Barb. 396), or where a verdict is ordered subject to the opinion of the court (Taylor v. Ilarlow, sp. t., 11 How. 285), judg. ment can be entered only on direction of the general term.,On a verdict subject to the opinion of tle court, the complaint may be dismissed, if such disposition of the case woul lhave been proper in the first instance. (Chit- tndend v. E .mpire Stone Dressijng Co., 6 Duer, 30.),ART. 3.-Judgment on trial by the court. As we have heretofore stated (ante, I. 510), when a cause is tried by the court without a jury, the judge must render a decision in writing, signed by him, which is the sole proper authority for entering up judgment.,A judgment entered upon trial by the court without such a written decision, is irregular (Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; Thomlas v. Tannter, sp. t., :14 How. 426; see Salds v. Church, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 347; Iussell v. Armador, 2 Cal. 305; Bates v. Bower, 17 Mo. 550; Sutter v. Streit, 21 id. 157; Ragan v. M1'Coy, 26 id. 166), though not void. (Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427; see Sands v. Church, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 347.),Not only must there be a decision in writing, but it must be signed by the judge (Tthomas v. Talner, sp. t., 14 How. 426), and it must state the conclusions of fact and law separately (Ciode, Â§ 267), or the judgment will be irregular. (Doening v. Post, sp.t., 1 Code Rep. 121; see Hutlce v. Sherman, 13 How. 411; Church v. Erben, 4 Sands. 691; Peelk v. Yorks, sp. t., 14 How. 416.),In Missouri (Bates v. Bower, 17 Mo. 550, and other cases stpra) and California (Russell v. Arnmador, 2 Gal. 305) a-judgment entered without a proper decision in writing is reversible on appl)al; but in this state the error is a ground for motion to set aside the judgment (Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; Thomas v. Tanner,
Judgment on trial by referee. Judgment book. sp. t., 14 How. 426), and not for an appeal. (HiTke v. Sherman, 13 How. 411.),ART. 4.-Jitdgment on trial by referees. When the whole issue is tried by a referee, judgment may be entered upon his decision, in the same manner as on trial by the court (Code, Â§ 272), without any order of the court upon the subject. (Renlouil v. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125; see Bihin v. Bikhin, 17 Abb. 19.),No doubt this provision applies to a case in which issues of law and fact have been raised, and the issues of law have been decided by the court, leaving all the issues of fact ta the referee. In such case, the whole remaining issue is decided by the referee.,This provision does not apply to a reference upon failure to answer. The referee's report, in such a case, must be confirmed by the court, before judgment can be entered. (Cram v. Bradford, 4 Abb. 193.),The rules regulating the entry of judgment on the decision of a judge, are equally applicable to judgment on the report of a referee. (See Code, Â§ 267, 272.),ART. 5.-Jzudgtellt book. The clerk of the court must keep a judgment book Code, Â§ 279), in which he must enter all judgments (Code, Â§ 280) at full length; and as the judgment thus entered is the original judgment, of which the judgment roll is to contain a copy, the judgment roll cannot be properly made up until this entry has been made (Sc7iteectady &c. P. R. Co. v. 'hatcher, sp. t., 6 How. 226), and there is, strictly speaking, no judgment until this is done (see ib.; Blydenburgh7 v. Northrop, sp. t., 13 How. 289); but the court will not allow suitors to be prejudiced by the omis- sions of its officers (Neele v. Berryhill, sp. t., 4 How. 16:; Renouil v. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125; Chi- chester v. Candle, 3 Cow. 39; Close v. Gillespy, 3 Johns. 526; Seaman v. Drake, 1 Cai. 9), and as this is clearly,709
Judgment book. Judgment roll. the duty of the clerk, and not of the party, the court will direct it to be done inc pro tune at any time. (Neele v. Berryhill, supra.),The omission of the clerk to sign the judgment does not render it void (Van Alstyne v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489; Artisans' Bank v. Treadiwell, 34 Barb. 553) ;* and the court will direct this also to be done iCne pro tune, and sustain all intermediate proceedings on the judgment (ib.; Sea- onan v. Draik, 1 Cai. 9); and in all collateral proceedings it should be disregarded. (Ib.),ART. 6.--J7udgment roll. A judgment roll must in all eases be filed with the clerk (Code, Â§ 281); and it has been said that in the entire absence of such a roll, or of the most material part of it, the judgment is void as to third persons, and cannot be a lien, or justify an execution. (Tor!wnsheind v. Wesson, 4 Duer, 342.f) But it seems to us that if the papers con- stituting a judgment roll are all filed with the clerk, his neglect to attach them together cannot be allowed so seriously to prejudice the judgment creditor. It is cer-' tain that in numerous cases the courts have allowed judgment rolls to be amended, nunc pro tunc, or have even disregarded defects in them not much inferior to those existing in the case cited above. (See Renouiilv. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125; Cook v. Dickerson, 1 Duer, 679; Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427; Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; Calkins v. Packer, 21 Barb. 275; Martin v. Kanoise, 2 Abb. 390.) In Towunsh7end v. Wesson (supra), we believe that the pleadings were not on file at all. Had they been on file, though not connected in a roll, the case might have been decided differently. The fact that the papers constituting the roll were not attached together, though all on file, was recently held to,* MAanning v. Guyon, (sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 43) is not followed. t This case was affirmed in the Court of Appeals.
Judgment roll. By whom prepared. On failure to answer. be no objection to the validity of a judgment. (Earle v. Barnard, sp. t., 22 How. 437.),By z7 wom lprelpared.]-The successful party may prepare the judgment roll (Code, Â§ 281); and it is decidedly advis- able for his own sake that he should do so, inasmuch as any defects in it will almost certainly cause him trouble and expense, if not substantial injury; but he is not bound to attend to it (Heinemannt v. Waterbury, 5 Bosw. 686; Cook v. Dickerson, 1 Duer, 679; Renouil v. Har2ris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125), for it is the clerk's duty, and not the attorney's, to prepare the roll. (Ib.; Code, Â§ 2S1.),Contents on, failure to answer.]-If none of the defend- ants answer, the judgment roll must be made up by attaching together the summons and complaint, or copies thereof, the documents proving service of the summons (and complaint, if served), and that no answer has been received, the report, if any, and a copy of the judgment. (Cole, Â§ 281.) By "report" is meant the report of the clerk or referee, in cases where such is required. We have no doubt that it is to be construed as including a sheriff's return to a writ of inquiry, or order for assessment of damages.,The copy of the judgment must be a copy of that entered in the judgment book (Schenectadiy &c. P. R. Co. v. Tlhtc7her, sp. t., 6 How. 226), and must be signed by the clerk. (Ib.) It has been suggested (Van Santv. Eq. Pr. 137), that orders necessarily affecting the judgment should be at- tached to the judgment roll, as well where there is no answer as where there is. And such seems to be the view taken by the commissioners of the Code in their Book of Porms (No. 279).,Certainly all orders necessary to show the regularity of the proceedings must be included in the roll. Thus, the,711
Judgment roll. On failure to answer. After answcr, order for assessment, or writ of inquiry, must be inserted when damages are assessed by a jury or referee (Book of Forims, No. 281); and when the summons is served by publication, the order for publication, as well as the affi davit of such publication, must be inserted. (Book of Forms, No. 280; see Halllett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 45.),But there are some orders which accomplish their pur- pose so fully as to leave no room for them on the record. Thus, if tie summons or complaint is amended by order or otherwise, the original document is abandoned and must not be on the record. (See Broiwn v. Saratoga R. R, Co., 18 N. Y. 495.) Even when an answer has been stricken out as sham and irrelevant, it would seem that the defendant cannot have it entered upon the record with the order, but that the record must be entirely free from it. (Briggs v. Bergen, 23 N. Y. 162.*),Where judgment is entered upon an unverified com- plaint on an instrument for the payment of money only, the roll need not contain any report of the clerk's assess- ment of the amount due. Such a report is not required. (Am. Exch. JBank v. Smith, 6 Abb. 1.),Contents after answier.]-If the complaint is answered by any defendant, the judgment roll must contain the summons and pleadings, or copies thereof, and a copy of the judgment, with any verdict or report, offer of the defendant to compromise, exceptions, case, and all orders and papers in any way involving the merits and neces- sarily affecting the judgment. (Code, Â§ 281.),If any one of the defendants has answered, no affidavit of the failure of the others to plead seems to be required. * Compare People v. M2cCumber (18 N. Y. 315), in which such an order was reviewed on appeal from the judgment. Also see Book of Forms, No. 279. t To the contrary was Squire v. llsworth (sp. t., 4 How. 77).
Judgment roll. After answer. After hearing at general term. (Catlit v. Billings andl Latson, sp. t., 13 How. 511; 4 Abb. 248.*) And as against a defendant who has answered or demurred, proof of service of the summons must not be inserted in the roll. (Sm7ith7 v. Holmes, 19 N. Y. 271.) Where the defendant's answer sets up only a counter- claim, which the plaintiff admits, his written admission must be inserted in the judgment roll, on entering judg- ment for the excess of his claim. (Code, Â§ 246.),t Contents on dismissal.]-Whlere the complaint is dis- missed for want of prosecution, the judgment roll consists of the summons, pleadings, order dismissing tle com- plaint, and, if the order is conditional, an affidavit of non-compliance with its conditions.,Contents after trial.]-After trial by jury, the minutes of the trial should be inserted. When the action is tried by a referee, the order of reference and the referee's report must be inserted in the judgment roll. (See Book of EZorms, No. 287.),When the action is tried by the court, the decision of the judge must be inserted (Burger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11; Thomas v. Tanner, sp. t., 14 How. 426; see Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abl). 427), and his opinion will not supply its place (Thotmas v. Tanner, supra), nor should that be in the roll at all. (Ib.) On the other hand, the decision will not supply the place of the copy of the judgment. (Sclenectady &c. P. R. Co. v. Thatcher, sp. t., 6 How. 226.),Contents after hearing at general term,.]-After a de- cision at general term upon a verdict subject to the opinion of the court, the statement which is required by Q 333 to be made of the facts and legal conclusions, must be inserted in the judgment roll. (C'ode, Â§ 333.),* Affrmed at general term. (See 16 N. Y. 622.),90,713
Judgment roll. Notice of judgment. Case or exceltions.]-A case or bill of exceptions is to be added to the judgment roll when perfected, and tie filing of the roll is not to be deferred until such papers are prepared. (Renoil v. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 1 Code Rep. 125; Lynde v. Cozventoven, sp. t., 4 How. 327.\,What should lot be in the rloll.]-Orders not affecting the judgment should not be included in the roll.,Thus an order of arrest (CorwCin v. Frceland, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 565), and the affidavits on which it was granted (ib.), the affidavit or other papers used on a requisition of personal property (see Kerrigan. . Ray, sp. t., 10 How. 213), or, in short, any papers pertaining merely to a pro visional remedy; the bill of costs and papers used upon its adjustment (Cook v. Dic7erson, 1 Duer, 679; Sc7eneee tady &e. P. R. Co. v. Thatcher, sp. t., 6 How. 226), must not be inserted in the judgment roll.,A demurrer that has been overruled and withdrawn on leave to answer (Brown v. Saratoga R. R. Co., IS N.Y. 495), like a pleading that has been amended (ib.), must not be put in the judgment roll.,Time at which enrollment is deemeld made.]-The enroll- ment of the judgment takes efiect back by relation to the time at which the judgment was entered. (Goelet v. Lan. sing, 6 Johns. Oh. 75.),ART. 7.-Notice of judgment. For the purpose of limiting the time to appeal (Code, Q 332), or to except (id. Â§ 268), written notice of the entry of judgment must be served upon the party whose appeal is to be limited (Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385; Staring v. Jones, sp. t., 13 How. 423); and this, not- withstanding the appellant had full knowledge of the fact (ib.), and even though he entered the judgment him- self. (Rani7in v. Pine, 4 Abb. 309.),Strict adherence to regular practice is required in re- 714
Notice of judgment. What will limit appeal. gard to this notice (Yorks v. Peck, 17 How. 192), inasmuch as its effect is inflexible, and often severe. Thus, if it is not signed (Yorks v. Peck,, supra), and that by the regular attorney of record (see Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385), or if it omits to state in what county the judgment is entered (Valton v. National Loan &c. Ins. So., sp. t., 19 How. 515), or omits anything required by statute or rules of court (Yorks v. Peck, 17 How. 192), or is served before the judgment or order is entered in its final shape Boewman~( v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691; Sherman v. IWells, 14 How. 522; see Leavy v. Roberts, 2 Hilt. 285; 8 Abb. 310), or is served pending a general stay of proceedings (Bag- ley v. Smit7h, 2 Sands. 651), it is a nullity. And it will never be amended, but the party will be left to give notice anew. A notice proceeding from any other person than the attorney of record for the adverse party (see Fry v. Ben- lett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 285), or served upon an attor- ney who has appeared for a party without authority, does not operate to limit the time allowed such party to ap- peal. (Bates v. Voorlees, 20 N. Y. 525, 529.) It seems that the substance of the judgment should be stated in the notice. (Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385.) It will i refore be the best course to annex a literal copy of the judgment to, or embody it in the notice. A mere copy of the judgment, duly certified by the clerk, has been held a sufficient notice of its entry to limit the right of appeal. (Mason v. Jones, Code Rep. N. S. 335; see Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385.) When judgment is entered upon the report of a referee, a copy of such report must be served with the notice, or the latter will be ineffectual to limit the time for excep- tions. (Rule 32, Supreme Ct.),715
CHAPTER CXI. LIEN OF JUDGMENT. ARTICLE 1. What judgments may be liens.,2. Lien, how secured. 3. The lien. 4. Suspension of the lien. 5. Extinction of the lien. ART. 1.--W7at judgmensts may be liens. A judgment lien can be created only by a judgment directing, in whole or in part, the payment of money. (Code, Â§ 282; see De Agreda v. Mantel, sp. t., 1 Abb. 130.) It is not necessary that the judgment should be for money only, but if it is not, it is a lien only to the extent of the money adjudged to be paid.,Nor can a judgment be made a lien until the amount due under it is judicially ascertained. (De Agreda v. Mantel, supra.) The test of the right to docket a judg- ment is the right to issue execution thereon. (Ib.),Orders on petitions.]-Any order or jadgment directing the payment of money, founded on petition, without an ordinary complaint, may be enrolled and docketed in lice manner with any other judgment, at the request of any party interested. (Rtle 56, Suplreme Ct.),ART. 2.-Lien, 7how secured. The lien of a judgment can be secured only by docket- ing it, in conformity to the statute. (Blydenburgh v. North 'rop, sp. t., 13 How. 289; Butchan v. Sumner, 2 Barb. Oh. R. 165, 193; see 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 638, 639; [2 id. 360]; Laws 1840, ch. 386.),Docket, wvhat.]-The docket is a book which the clerk of each county is bound to keep, and in which he must enter, as soon as a judgment roll, or the transcript of a docket is filed: 716,LIEN OF JUDGIMENT.
Lien, how secured. Docketing judgment. Errors in docket. 1. The names, at length, of all the parties to such judgment, designating particularly those against whom it is rendered, with their places of abode, titles, trades, or professions, if any such are stated in the record; 2. The amount of the debt, damages, or other sum of money recovered, with the costs; 3. The hour and day of entering such docket; 4. If tlhe judgment is against several persons, such statement must be repeated, under the name of each person against whom such judgment was recovered, in the alphabetical order of their names, respectively. (3 B. S. (5t7 ed.) 639; [2 id. 360].),What iudglnents mlay be docketed.l-Only judgments for the payment of money can be docketed. (Code, Â§ 282; see Art. 1, supra.),When to be doclceted.]-A judgment cannot be docketed until the judgment roll is filed. (See Code, Â§ 282.) A judgment cannot regularly be docketed out of the office hours fixed by statute (Rule 9, Slupreme Ct.), and if it is, it should be set aside. Formerly, it was held that a judgment delivered at an earlier hour might be docketed as of the precise hour of legally opening the office (War- dell v. Mason, 10 Wend. 575); but even this is perhaps not allowed under the rule. At any rate, a judgment so filed could not be allowed any priority over one filed by a person who entered the office as'soon as it was open, but who should fail to catch the attention of the clerk at once. Otherwise manifest abuses might arise. Errors in docket.]-Errors in the docket which do not actually prejudice bona fide purchasers, are to be disre- garded (Sears v. Blrn7hamn, 17 N. Y. 445; aff'g S. C., 2 Bradf. 394); and will be amended inne pro tune, except as against such persons actually prejudiced. (Geller v. Hoyt, s8. t., 7 How. 265; Hunt v. Grant, 19 Wend. 90; note to Chichester v. Cande, 3 Cow. 42.) Subsequent judgment,717
The lien What is bound. creditors for antecedent debts will not be protected. (Gellr v. Hoyt, supra.),ART. 3.-The lien. What is 7bound.]-The lien of a judgment extends to all the real property, including lands, tenements and here. ditaments (Code, Â§ 462), in the county where it is docketed, of every person against whom it is rendered, or which he may acquire in such county at any time thereafter, for ten years from the time of docketing it in the county where it was rendered. (Code, Â§ 282.),Estates held on lease (see Evertson v. Sawyer, 2 Wend. 507), even from year to year (Bigeloiv v. Finch, 17 Barb. 394), are bound by a judgment lien, provided the lessee is in possession, but not otherwise. (Crane v. O'Coloor, 4 Edv.. Ch. 409.),A mere charge on land is not bound by this lien. (Sctudder v. Yoorhis, 5 Sands. 271; see Payn v. Beal, 4 Denio, 405.),The interest of a purchaser of land, who has not per- sected his legal title, is not bound by a judgment docketed against him (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 35; [1 id. 744]);* and this whether he has fully paid for the land or not. (Grosvenar v. Allen, 9 Paige, 74.) The creditor must reach such property by supplementary proceedings, or by action.,Nor is a judgment a lien upon land conveyed to a third person for a consideration paid by the judgment debtor after judgment. The resulting trust in favor of the creditor can only be enforced by action. (See Garfield v. Hatmaklcer, 15 N. Y. 475.),A judgment does not bind land standing in the name of the judgment debtor, but equitably belonging to another person (Lounsbury v. Purdy, sp. t., 11 Barb. 490; asf'd, 16 id. 376; 18 N. Y. 515; Gouvernetr v. Titu, 6,* This provision is generally supposed to be unaffected by the Code, and yet it may be a matter of doubt.
The lien.. Duration of lien. Paige, 347; 1 Edw. Oh. 477; Ells v. Tousley, 1 Paige, 280); nor does it supersede prior specific (Diight v. Neveell, 3 N. y. [3 Comst.] 185) equitable liens. (Moyer v. Hinman, 13 NY. Y.[3 Kern.] 180; Sweet v. Jacocks, 6 Paige, 355; Arnold v. Patric7l, id. 310; Keirsted v. Avery, 4 id. 9; White v. Carpenter, 2 id. 266; Matter of Howue, 1 id. 125.) Whether a specific equitable lien, attaching at the same moment with the general lien of a judgment, is in any case entitled to a preference, seems doubtful (Moyer v. Biinnan, supra); but if it ever is, it certainly is not when created to secure an antecedent debt. (Ib.) One who has purchased land from the debtor before the judgment is docketed, is at liberty to pay the purchase- money to him, so long as he has no actual notice of the judgment. He is not bould to search the docket for any period subsequent to his purchase, and is in no way affected by the lien. (Moyer v. Himi1tan, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 180; Parkis v. Jackson [Ct. of Errors], 11 Wend. 442.) Duration of lien.]-Whether the provisions of the Re- vised Statutes on the subject of judgment liens (2 R. S. (1st ed.) 182, 359), are in force or not, the interpretation put upon them by the courts is the same that would be put upon the Code. It was held that the lien ceased at the end of ten years, against purchasers or incumbrancers, whether having notice of the judgment or not (see Pettit v. Shepherd, 5 Paige, 502; Tufts v. Tufts, 18 Wend. 521; Little v. Harvey, 19 Wend. 621), unless they were actually guilty of fraud. (Ib.) As against the judgment debtor and his heirs (Walter- mire v. Westover, 14 N. Y. 16; see Perzt 1ron Co.'s case, 7 Cow. 554; Scott v. Howard, sp. t., 3 Barb. 319), or his grantees without a valuable consideration (Mohawki Bank v. Atwater, 2 Paige, 54; Mower v. Kip, 2 Edw. Oh. 165), or a grantee colluding with him to defraud the creditor (Pettit v. Shepherd, 5 Paige, 493), the lien remains in force for twenty years at least.,719
Suspension of lien. On appeal. In other cases.,-I ART. 4.-Suslenslion of lien. On allpeal.]-When an appeal has been taken from a judgment, and duly perfected, and security duly given sufficient to stay execution (Code, Â§ 282; HIoppock v. Cot- trell, sp. t., 13 How. 461), the court in which the judg- ment was recovered may, on special motion, after notice to the owner of the judgment, "in* such terms as they shall see fit," direct an entry to be made by the clerk on the docket of such judgment, that the same is " secured on appeal," and thereupon it ceases, during the pend- ing of the appeal, to be a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor as against purchasers and mortgageest in good faith. (Code, Â§ 282.),It is in the discretion of the court to grant or refuse this order (Pitch v. Livingston, 4 Sands. 712; Munn v. Barnum, sp. t., 2 Abb. 409), or to impose terms upon granting it. (Muann v. Barnum, supra.),The applicant is not bound to give notice of this motion to his sureties (BuIrrall v. Vanderbilt, 1 Bosw. 637; 6 Abb. 70; Livingston v. Roberts, 5 Duer, 680; 3 Abb. 231); but the court may very properly require such notice to be given before proceeding with the motion. (Munn v. Bar- mni, sp. t., 2 Abb. 409; see Burrall v. Vanderbilt, supra.),In other cases.]-Actual imprisonment of the debtor on execution under the judgment, suspends the lien (Jackson v. Benedict, 13 Johns. 533; see Ban k of Beloit v. Beale, sp. t., 11 Abb. 375; 20 How. 331), but if he escapes (M'Guinty? v. Herrick, 5 Wend. 240), or is discharged under a statute (see Chapman v. Hatt, 11 Wend. 41), the lien revives. (Jackson v. Benedict, 13 Johns. 533.),When a judgment is vacated, its lien is of course ex- * Probably a clerical mistake for " on." See Munn v. Barnmu (sp. t, 2 Abb. 409.) t Incumbraners of any kind are doubtless included in this term. 720
Buspension of lien. Extinction of lion. tinguished, but if the order setting it aside is reversed on appeal, its lien revives without redocketing. (King v. Earris, 30 Barb. 471.) Whenever a lien, having been extinguished, is revived, such revival is without prejudice to intervening pur- chasers or incumbrances in good faith. (King v. Harris, 30 Barb. 471; TJackson v. Benedict, 13 Johns. 533. To same effect, Bcbee v. Bank of N. Y. [C. of Errors] 1 Johns. 529.),So if an entry of satisfaction is vacated by the court, it, will be without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in. good faith and for value (Taylor v. jRanney, 4 Hill, 619; Bebee v. Bank of N. Y., 1 Johns. 529); espe- cially if the error is occasioned by the creditor's own act. (Ib.) The dormancy of an execution against personal pro- perty (3lTir v. Leitch, 7 Barb. 341), or an agreement to postpone payment of the judgment (ib.), does not affect its lien.,ART. 5.-Extinction of lien. Whatever operates as a satisfaction of the judgment, total or partial, of course operates as an extinction of its lien. A levy upon sufficient personal property to satisfy the judgment, extinguishes the lien (Toorltees v. Gros, sp. t., 3 How. 262; ,Jackcson v. Bowen, 7 Cow. 13; Ex)p. Law- reice, 4 id. 417), which is not revived by a release of such property. (lb.) The lien upon any particular piece of land is extin- guished by its sale under the judgment, even though a balance remains due (Russell v. Allen, 10 Paige, 249), but it will attach, for stch balance, to a subsequently acquired title of the debtor. (Ib.) The recovery of a new judgment on a judgment, if of no higher degree, does not affect the lien of the earlier,91,721
Extinction of lien. Vacating judgments judgment.* (Planters' Bank v. Culvit, 3 Sme. & M. 199; see Millard v. WhitaJer, 5 Hill, 408; Andrceus v. Smith, 9 Wend. 53; Mumford v. Stocker, 1 Cow. 178; Jackson v. Shaffer, 11 Johns. 513.),A judgment once paid cannot be kept on foot as alien to protect new demands. (Truscott v. King, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 147; Troup v. Wood, 4 Johns. Oh. 228; see Bergen v. Boerum, 2 Cai. 256.) A partial payment operates as a discharge of the lien pro tanto (Ct. of Errors, Marvin v. Fedder, 5 Cow. 671; De La Vergne v. Evertson, 1 Paige, 181); and though the money be returned under an agree- ment between the parties that the lien shall continue, yet as to third persons, the lien is gone. (lb.),CHAPTER CXII. VACATING AND CORRECTING JUDGMENTS. ARTICLE 1. Vacating judgments as matter of right.,2. Vacating judgments as matter of favor. 3. Opening judgment after service of summons by publication. 4. Correction of judgments. ART. 1. Vacating judgments as matter of right. Void judgments.]-A void judgment may be set aside on motion; and the strict rules as to the time of moving for such purpose, which prevail in regard to motions on account of mere irregularity, do not apply to a motion on this ground. (Hallett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 43; see Chapell v. Chappell, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 215; Borsdorff V. .Dayton, sp. t., 17 Abb. 36 n.),Nor should the moving party be required to show that he will sustain actual damage from such judgment. (Ianw bert v. Converse, sp. t., 22 How. 265.),* To the contrary is Purdy v. Doyle (1 Paige, 558).
Vacating as of right. Fraudulent judgment. Irregular judgments. Fraudulentjudgnent.]-A judgment obtained by fraud may be set aside on motion of the party against whom it is entered, or of a third person whose rights are prejudiced by its lien; but in the latter case the facts should be proved beyond reasonable doubt, or the matter must be left to be decided by an action. (Hill v. Northrop, sp. t., 9 How. 525 ; seeFrink v. Morrison, sp. t., 13 Abb. 80.) A judgment entered by collusion between the parties, or some of them (Cleveland v. Porter, sp. t., 10 Abb. 407; see Iss v. Bridge, 15 Abb. 150; 24 How. 163), or between the parties recovering judgmf nt, and the attorney for the adverse party (People v. MZajr &c. of N. Y., sp. t., 19 How. 289), or in consequence of stipulations made by the attorney for the unsuccessful party, without authority (People v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., sp. t., 11 Abb. 661, will be vacated on motion of any one prejudiced thereby. Excessive delay is a bar to this application (Corwitie v. arising, sp. t., 21 Barb. 9; Boyd v. Vanderl7nep, 1 Barb. Ch. . 273), though time will be reckoned, in judging of delay, from the period at which the fraud was discovered. Irregular judgnments.]--No judgment can be set aside on motion for irregularity, unless the motion is made within one year from the rendering of such judgment. (3 1. 8. (5th ed.) 637; [2 id. 359].) This has been construed to bar a motion noticed within the year for a day after the year (Cook v. Diclerson, 1 Duer, 679), but this seems a harsh construction, and may be reconsidered. The motion in the ease cited was denied on the merits. It is a general rule in regard to mere irregularities, that amotion against them must be made promptly (Cagger v. Gardner, sp. t., 1 How. 142), or that the delay must be accounted for satisfactorily. (See Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427.) But a void or wholly unauthorized judgment is not within these rules, nor the statute. (See ante, p. 722; Simonsol v. Blakce, 12 Abb. 331.) A variance between the order for judgment, pronounced bythe court or referee, and that entered on the judgment,723
Vacating as of right. Vacating of favor. roll, is a mere irregularity. (Ingerso[l v. Bostiicl, 22 N.Y. 425; Martin v. Lott, sp. t., 4 Abb. 365.) So is tlhe want of a written decision in the judgment roll on trial by the. court. (Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427.),A judgment clearly irregular must be set aside on motion duly made, without considering whether the moving party has merits in the action or not. (Hughes v. Wood, sp. t., 5 Duer, 603 n.; Howell v. Dentnislon, 3 Cai. 96; Perine v. Blaclford, sp. t., 2 How. 131.),A judgment cannot be vacated for any default ornegli- gence by which the moving party is not prejudiced. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 722; [2 id. 425] ; Bascom v. Feazler, sp. t., 2 How. 16.),Errors of law at the trial, to which exceptions might be takei,, or which might be reviewed on a case, are no ground for a motion to set aside the judgment as irregular. (Craig v. Fanning, sp. t., 6 How. 336.),UTnauthoarized jutdgwlents.]-A judgment entered with-' out any authority of law (Borsdorff v. Dayton, sp. t., 17 Abb. 36 n.), or in excess of the authority conferred by law (Simonson v. Blake, 12 Abb. 331), will be vacated on: motion, even though more than one year has elapsed since its entry. (lb.),This is the only remedy against such errors. They; cannot be made a ground of appeal. (Ingcrsoll v. Bost- wick, 22 N. Y. 425.),ART. 2.-Vacating judrgment as matter of favor. On failure to answer after personal service.]--The court may, in its discretion, vacate a judgment obtained on failure to answer, and allow the defendant to answer. (Code, Â§ 174; Allen v. Ackley, sp. t., 4 How. 5.),It is almost a matter of course to open a default, when the defendant's neglect is excused, and the proposed defense is not clearly frivolous, nor unconscionable, and
Vacating judgment as matter of favor. is set up in good faith. (CoaL'rs of Excist v. Hollister, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 588.) Unless some specific ground for opening a judgment appears in the moving papers, it should not be set aside. ('llis v. Jones, sp. t,, 6 How. 296.) Some excuse must be shown for neglecting to answer in time.* (Cowiton v. Anderson, sp. t., 1 How. 145; Spencer v. Webb, 1 Cai. 118; Coyswoell v. Vancdrbergh, id. 156; M'linstry v. Edwards, 2 Johns. Cas. 113; see Code, Â§ 174.) An oral stipulation or understanding may be a good ground of excuse for a default (Wager v. Stickle, 3 Paige, 407; see lMann v. Provost, sp. t., 3 Abb. 446), though not sufficient to make it irregular. (lb.) An affidavit of merits must be served with the notice of motion, in actions for ordinary relief (Robinson v. Sin- clair, sp. t., 1 How. 106; Alberti v. Peek, sp. t., id. 230; Stetwart v. l'Martin, sp. t., 2 id. 38; Bogardus v. Doty, sp. t., id. 75): i at nothing more should be required in such cases (Van Horne v. llMotgomery, sp. t., 5 How. 238), unless there are circumstances of suspicion about the defendant's case (see ib.), in which event a full statement of the nature of the defense should be given. (Ellis v. oenes, sp. t., 6 How. 296; Dix v. Palmer, sp. t., 5 id. 233; see Allen v. Ackley, sp. t., 4 How. 5.) In actions for special relief, an affidavit of merits being often inappropriate, the proposed answer or its substance should be submitted wi'h the motion papers (Wis7hilp v. Jewett, 1 Barb. Oh. I. 173; Hunt v. Walls (. Paige, 376), unless the defendant is absent from the state, in which case security may be required. (Wells v. Cruger, 5 Paige, 164.) In general, the court will not hear affidavits in reply to an affidavit of merits (Hanford v. M'iNair, 2 Wend. 286; see Catlib v. Billings & Latson, sp. t., 13 How. 511; *: . number of decisions upon the sufficiency of excuses are collected in 2 bbotts' Digest 391. See also Clark v. Lyon (2 Hilt. 91).,725
Vacating judgment as matter of favor.,_ -- -7 4 Abb. 248); but if it clearly appears that the defense is unfounded, that may be taken into consideration. (Catlin v. Billings, supra; see Ferussacv. Thorn, sp. t., 1 Barb. 42.),A default will not be opened to admit an unconscion. able (Morris v. Slatery, sp. t, 6 Abb. 74; King v. Mer- chants' Exch. Co., 2 Sands. 693; Bard v. Fort, 3 Barb. Ch, R. 632; Parker v. Grant, 1 Johns. Oh. 630)* or merely technical defense (Gay v. Gay, 10 Paige, 369), nor to enable the defendant to prove matter in mitigation of damages, as that can be done before the sheriff's jury. (Hays v. Berryman, sp. t., 6 Bosw. 679.),Usury is usually regarded as an unconscionable defense within this rule (Morris v. Slatery, sp. t., 6 Abb. 74; Toolk v. Cook, sp. t., 16 How. 142); and in chancery the defend. ant was always required to consent to a decree for the amount justly due, as a condition of opening a default. (National Fire Ins. Co. v. Sackett, 11 Paige, 660; Watt . Watt, 2 Barb. Oh. R. 371.) The defense of the statute of limitations should not be prohibited on a default, unless for special reasons. (Gourlay v. Hutton, 10 Wend. 595; .Douglas v. Douglas, 3 Edw. Ch. 390; but see Baoes v. Hoyt, sp. t., 11 How. 454; Allen v. Ackley, sp. t, 4 How. 5.) A plea of former adjudication is not unconscionable, and should not be excluded after a default. (Audiavoi v. Excelsior Ins. Co., sp. t., 10 Abb. 64.) In an action on a note, the defendant ought to be allowed, after default, to plead that it was given for money won a3 play, and this even against a bona fide holder. (Bank of Kinderhool v. Gifford, sp. t., 40 Barb. 659.),A judgment should not be opened to the prejudice of the plaintiff, merely to enable the defendant to interposa a counterclaim, if there is no doubt as to the plaintiff's responsibility. (Lahey v. Kingon, sp. tI, 13 Abb. 192; 22 How. 209.) * These decisions are condemned in Bank of Kindeirook v. Gaffor (iP. Lt 40 Barb. 659).
Vacating jrdgment as matter of favor. On whose motion. Unreasonable delay is a strong objection to granting this motion (Bliss v. Treadwuy, sp. t., 1 How. 245; De- wandelaer v. Hager, sp. t., id. 61), especially if the rights of the plaintiff against third persons have meanwhile become impaired. (N. Y. Life Ins. & Trust Co. v. Smith, 2 Barb. Ch. R. 82.) A judgment will not be opened to give a party a mere nominal advantage which can be of no practical benefit to him. (De Peyster v. Hildreth, 2 Barb. Oh. R. 109.) In other cases.]-Where, after judgment, or after the time has passed, before judgment, in which the party can avail himself thereof (see Wetmore v. Law, sp. t., 34 Barb. 515; 22 How. 130), new facts arise or are discovered which make it.inequitable to enforce the judgment, it may be vacated on motion. (Ib.; see Clark v. iwling, 3 N. Y. [3 Oomst.] 216, 222.) If, therefore, a judgment is discharged in bankruptcy or insolvency, either after judgment, or after it is too late to plead the discharge, the judgment should be vacated on motion. (Palmer v. Hutchins, 1 Cow. 42; Baker v. iUster 0. P., 4 Johns. 191; Lester v. Mundell, 1 Bos. & Pul. 427, see Clark v. Rowling, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.] 222; Thomnpson v. Hewitt, 6 Hill, 254.) As to opening judgments after trial or inquest, see ante p. 569.,On, whose motion.]--A judgment may be vacated on the application of the party in whose favor it was rendered, as well as on that of the other party (Montgomery v. Ellis, sp. t., 6 How. 296); but a motion for that purpose must bN made on notice to all the adverse parties, whether served with process or not. (Barheydt ads. Adams, 1 Wend 101.),727
Opening after service by publication. Correction of judgments. ART. 3.-Opening. judgment after service of Su1tmmo1s by,publication. Except in an action for divorce, a defendant (or his representatives) against whom judgment has been taken upon a summons served by publication, may, upon good cause shown, be allowed to defend the action aft 1 judg- ment, at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just. (Code, Â§ 135.),If such defense is successful, and the judgment has been enforced, in whole or in Iart, such restitution may thereupon be compelled as the court may direct, but the title to property sold under such judgment to a purchaser in good faith cannot be affected. (Id.),.TLhese provisions do not. of course, restrict the right or duty of the court to open a judgment taken upon a ser- vice void for want of jurisdiction. Such a judgment must be opened at any time (Titus v. Relyea, 8 Abb. 177; 16 How. 371), even in an action for divorce, where the plain- tiff has married again since judgment was recovered. (Wortman v. Wortman, 17 Abb. 66.),ART. 4.-Correction of judgments. If the judgment does not conform to the verdict, de- cision or report on which it is founded, the remedy is by motion to correct it, and not by appeal. (Ingersoll v. Bost- wickd, 22 N. Y. 425; Johnson v. Carnley, 10 N. Y. [( Seld.] 570.) The same course should be adopted in case of any mistake or miscalculation. (Rogers v. Hosack, 18 Wend. 319.),Errors in the recital of the judgment may and should be corrected upon motion. (Clemung Canal Bank v. Jud. son, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 254.),A motion to correct a judgment may be made and granted even after it has been affirmed on appeal. (See Rogers v. Hosack, 18 Wend. 31 .)
Acknowledgment of tatisfaction.,CHAPTER CXII. SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENT. AnTICLE 1. Acknowledgment of satisfaction.,2. Entry of satisfaction, and compulsion thereof. 3. Vacating satisfaction. Ans. 1.-Ac7cioledSiment of satisfaction. When the amount of a money judgment is paid, the attorney or party receiving payment is bound to acknow- ledge satisfaction, on the fees being paid by the debtor. (3 R. S. (5th ed) 641; [2 id. 362].) This acknowledgment must be made by the judgment creditor or his executor or administrator (3 R. S. (5thl ed.) 640; [2 id. 362]), or it may be made, with full effect, by the attorney of record for the party recovering judgment, at any time within two years after filing the judgment roll (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 640; [2 id. 362]); but if the authority of such attorney was revoked prior to such acknowledg- ment being made, it does not conclude the judgment creditor in respect to any person to whom actual notice of such revocation has been given before any payment thereon has been made, or purchase of property bound by such judgment has been effeeted. (Ib.) The attorney of record cannot, by virtue merely of his general authority as such, compromise the judgment debt, or accept anything but money in satisfaction. (Lewis v. Woodruff, 15 How. 539; Lewis v. Gamage, 1 Pick. 347; see Benedict v. Smith, 10 Paige, 162; Simonton v. Barrell, 21 Wend. 362; Kellogg v. Gilbert, 10 Johns. 220; Jackson v. Bartlett, 8 Johns. 361.),The satisfaction-piece, as the acknowledgment thus made is usually called, must be acknowledged by the party signing it, before the clerk (Laws 1834, ch. 262), or some judge of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or a county judge, or commissioner of deeds,,92,,729
Acknowledgment of satisfaction. Entry on sheriff's return. who must certify that the party making it is known to him, or has been made known by competent proof. (3 .. S. (5th ed.) 640; [2 id. 362].),If satisfaction is acknowledged by virtue of a power of attorney, or other written authority, such instrument must be acknowledged or proved before the clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or before some officer authorized to take acknowledgments of convey. ances of real estate, and must be filed with the satisfac. tion-piece. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 641; Laws 1834, ch. 262.),If the judgment creditor resides out of the state, the satisfaction-piece must be acknowledged before some officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds for this state. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 640; Laws 1834, c7. 262.),When the satisfaction-piece is regularly made out, it should be filed with the clerk in whose office the judgment was originally docketed, who must then enter satisfaction on the docket, and cancel the judgment. (3 1. 8. (5th ed.) 640; [2 id. 362].) The clerk must, on demand, and pay- ment of 121 cents, give a certificate of satisfaction, which should be filed with any other clerk in whose office a transcript of the judgment has been filed, and will then discharge its lien. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 641; Laws 1844, ch. 104, Â§ 5.),ABT. 2.-Entry of satisfaction, and compulsion tlereof. Entry of satisfaction.]-Filing the satisfaction-piece is not of itself a satisfaction of the judgment. (Lownds v, Remsen, 7 Wend. 35.) To effect that purpose, the fact of satisfaction mrst be entered on the roll (ib.), and even an entry of satisfaction on the docket, while it extinguishes the lien, does not extinguish the judgment. (Ib.),Entry on sheriff's return.-]-If the amount of a money judgment, or a part thereof, is collected by execution, the clerk to whom the execution is returned is bound to enter a memorandum of the fact on the margin of the docket, 730
Entry of satisfaction. Compelling acknowledgment. which is in effect a satisfaction pro tanto. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 641, [2 id., 362].) .No formal satisfaction-piece need there- fore be taken in such case; but a transcript of the record should be filed wherever the judgment has been made a lien.,Sheriff's certiJcate.]-Upon payment of a judgment to any sheriff holding an execution thereon, such sheriff must, on demand of the party paying, and on the further payment of twenty-five cents, deliver to such party a certified copy of the execution, with an indorsement of satisfaction thereon. (Laws 1860, ch. 6.),Upon filing such certified copy with the clerk of the sheriff's county (not that in which the judgment roll is filed, in case the payment is made to the sheriff of another county), such clerk must enter satisfaction on the docket, in like manner as upon the return of an execution satis- sied. (Ib.) On filing with the clerk of any other county in which the judgment has been docketed, a certificate of the clerk before mentioned that such copy of the execution has been filed, and the judgment discharged, satisfaction may be entered on the docket of that county. (Ib.),Compelling acnowledgment.]-If the creditor will not ac- knowledge satisfaction upon payment, the court will, on motion, compel him to do so, at his own expense, and charge him with costs of the motion, (Briggs v. Thompson, 20 Johns. 294) or will order satisfaction to be entered on the record without acknowledgment. (Bergen v. Boerum, 2 Cai. 256; see Pinder v. Morris, 3 id. 165.),Before the interference of the court is asked, however, the judgment debtor must prepare a satisfaction-piece, present it to the creditor, and offer to pay the expense of its execution. (Pettengill v. Mather, 16 Abb. 399.),If the sheriff has collected money sufficient to satisfy the judgment, but has made default in his return, the court will not direct satisfaction to be entered, lest that,731
Compelling satisfaction. Vacating satisfactioi. should prevent the creditor from proceeding against the sheriff, but will stay proceedings on the judgment. (Hams lin v. Boug7hton, 4 Cow. 65.),When a third person applies for protection against a judgment which is an apparent lien upon property pur- chased by him, and which is satisfied'so far as in equity to cancel that lien, but which is not clearly satisfied in full, the court will order a perpetual stay of execution, instead of entering satisfaction. (Smith v. Page, 15 Johns. 395.) If, however, the matter is involved in such doubt that the court cannot decide upon affidavits, it will leave the parties to proceed by action (Frin7k v. iorrison, sp. t., 13 Abb. 80; see Iansing v. Orcott, 16 Johns. 4), only stay- ing execution for a short time for the purpose of enabling the party aggrieved to sue without prejudice meanwhile. (Lansing v. Orcott, supra.),An entry of satisfaction will not be ordered on the ground of a recovery of a judgment upon the judgment, unless the judgment.is in fact paid. (Y21umiford v. Stocker, 1 Cow. 178.),ART. 3. Vacating satisfaction. If the acknowledgment or entry of satisfaction is pro- cured by fraud, or in any other way that entitles the cred- itor to avoid it, it will be set aside on motion. (Wardell v. Eden, 2 Johns. Cas. 258; 1 Johns. 534 n.) Thus, if the judgment has been assigned, and the assignor afterwards enters satisfaction, either without payment, or upon pay- ment to him after notice to the debtor of the assignment, the entry will be vacated. (Ib.) And so, if the entry of satisfaction has been made upon the levy and sale of pro- perty to which it afterwards proves that the debtor has no title, the entry will be vacated. (Sitydam v. Holden, 4 Seld. Notes, 16; see Field v. Paulding, 3 Abb. 139; 1 Hilt. 187; Wambauglh v. Gates, 11 Paige, 505.*),*Affirmed in Ct. of Appeals (How. App. Cas. 247). Â·
Vacating satisfaction. But if third parties have meanwhile paid value in good faith for property affected by the lien of the judgment, their rights will be saved on vacating satisfaction (Taylor v. Ranney, 4 Hill, 619; Bebee v. Balnk of N. Y. [Ct. of Errors] 1 Johns. 529); except, we suppose, in the case of an actual forgery of a satisfaction-piece.,CHAPTER CXIV. SE'T'ING OFF JUDGMENTS. The court will, on motion, order a judgment in favor of any party to be set off against a judgment against him (Ewen, v. Terry, 8 Cow. 126; Scermermerhorn v. Scler- werorlwr, 3 Cai. 190; see Simson v. Hart, 14 Johns. 75), if the debtor in the former ."-dgment is the creditor on the latter. (lb.) And a juidgment against two jointly may be set off against a judgment in favor of one of them individually. (Graves v. Woodbury, 4 Hill, 559; see Sibson v. Hart, 14 Johns. 63.) This will be done not only as to judgments in the same court, but also where they are recovered in different courts (ib.); and even though one of the judgments was recovered in a justice's court. (Ewten v. Terry, 8 Cow. 125; see Kimball v. 3Munger, 2 Hill, 364.) But the appli- cation must be made to the court in which the largest judgment was rendered (Breyvertoin v. Harris, 1 Johns. 144), at any rate, if that court is one having power to grant the motion. (Ib.),Relief will not be granted in this summary manner, where the judgments are not in the same court, unless the facts are clear (Story v. Patten, 3 Wend. 331), and the judgments in fulii force. (Harris v. Palmter, sp. t., 5 Barb. 105.) If it has been satisfied of record, the satisfaction must be first vacated; or if that cannot be done, the matter must be litigated by action. (Ib.),733
Setting off judgments. A judgment merely in reim cannot be set of. It must be one rendered upon appearance or service of process upon the defendant personally. (People v. Delaware C. P., 6 Cow. 598.),A judgment assigned by the original creditor may be set off in favor of the assignee; though not unless the assignment is absolute, and confers a beneficial interest upon the assignee (Satterlee v. Ten rEycl, 7 Cow. 480; Gilman v. Van Slyck, id. 469), especially when the other judgment has been assigned in good faith. (Mason v. Knowwion, 1 Hill, 218.),A denial of this motion is not a bar to an action for the same purpose. (Simnsoip v. Hart [Ct. of Errors], 14 Johns. 63.)

An execution is a judicial writ issued by the court in which the judgment was recovered, directing the enforce- ment of the judgment of the court, according to its nature.,There are three kinds of execution; one against the property of the judgment debtor; another against his person; and the third for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, or for such delivery with damages for withholding the same. (Code, Â§ 286.),HUBBARD, J., in Gridley v. Mcumnber (5 How. 414), says: "The Code, in my judgment, does not materially
What may be enforced by execution. Only judgments. change the law, as it previously existed, on the subject of executions; except that it prescribes a formula for the writ; the different kinds and primary objects remain as heretofore.",AnT. 2. What m7ay be enforced by execution. Only judgmlents.]-- Tothing but an actual, final judg- ment can be enforced by an execution. It cannot issue upon any mere order, even for judgment. (Bank of Roch- ester v. lEmerson, 10 Paige, 115, 359; Bicknell v. Byrnes, sp. t., 23 How. 486; see De Agreda v. IMantel, sp. t., 1 Abb. 130, 135; Cobb v. Thornton, sp. t., S How. 66.) An execu- tion so issued is not made valid by entry of judgment on such order after the return of the execution. (Bank of Rochester v. Emerson, 10 Paige, 115.),In chancery, no execution could issue against the per- son or property, except upon a decree, or upon some positive order in that nature. The execution upon the decree was a matter of right, and it was not necessary that the decree should specifically award it. (Tran Nress v. Cantine, 4 Paige, 55; Otis v. Forman, 1 Barb. Oh. R., 30.),Only judgments for money or property.]-No judgment can be enforced by execution, unless it requires the per- formance of some act. (Code, Â§ 285.) 'A judgment declara, tory of the existence'of a right, other than the right of possession of property, e. g., that a right exists to have a specified sum of money paid out of a specified estate (Chapman v. Lemon, sp. t.; 11 How. 236), or out of a fund in court (see Curtis v. Leavitt, 1 Abb. 274), or that 0. be ousted from an office and that D. is entitled thereto (People v. Coiiover, sp. t., 6 Abb. 220), cannot be enforced in that respect by execution.,The act required by the judgment must, in order to be enforceable by execution, be either payment of money, or delivery of property real or personal. (Code, Â§ 285.),But, although a judgment may require the performance
What may be enforced by. On transcript of justice's judgment. of other acts yet if it also requires the payment of money, it may be enforced in that respect by execution. (Gray v. Cook, sp. t., 24 How. 434; People v. Conover, sp. t., 6 Abb. 220, 226; see Code, Â§ 285; 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 629; [2 id. 342, Â§ 22].) It is not necessary that the judgment should require that the payment be made to the successful party in per- son. A judgment that a party pay a specified sum into court to await the further order of the court, is a judg- ment which requires the payment of money, within Â§ 285. (Gray v. Cook, supra.) Nor is it essential that the judgment be rendered in an action. Thus, a judg- ment rendered upon a submission of a controversy without action (Code, Â§ 374), or a judgment by confession (Code, Q 384), or a judgment upon a summons against joint debtors, or against heirs, devisees, legatees or tenants of a deceased judgment debtor (Code, Â§ 380), or a judgment entered as security merely (Dows v. Parker, 4 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 384), may be enforced by execution in the same manner as judgments rendered in an action. Against married wome).]-Execution may issue on a judgment recovered against a married woman; but it must direct the levy and collection to be made out of her separate property, and not otherwise. (Code, Â§ 287.*),On transcript of justice's judglment.]-A transcript of a judgment in a justice's court being filed in the county clerk's office, the judgment becomes a judgment of the county'court, and has the same effect as a lien, and is enforced in the same manner, as a judgment of the county court. (Laws 1849, cih. 438; Ginochio v. Figari, 4 E. D. Smith, 227; 2 Abb., 185.) After such a transcript has been filed, the judgment can be enforced in no other way than by execution out of the county court. (Martin,* As amended, 1862. 93,737

Y., sp; t., 11 Abb. 295; 20 How. 86; asf'd, 12 Abb. 243.),Judcgment unsatisfied.]-An execution cannot issue upon a judgment which has been satisfied of record (Ackerman v. Ac7erman, 14 Abb. 229; McGuinty v. Herrick, 5 Wend. 240; see Swati v. Saddlemire, 8 Wend. 676), until such satisfaction is vacated (Suydam v. Holden, 4 Seld. Notes, 16; see Field v. Pauzding, 3 Abb. 139; 1 Hilt. 187); and this notwithstanding it is voidable, as for fraud, mistake, &c. (Ackerman v. Alcerman, 14 Abb. 229.),Execution may issue on a judgment which has been satisfiÂ¢ed in part only by the judgment creditor using it as a set-off, although judgment for the part unsatisfied thereby has been again rendered in the action in which the original judgment was so set of. (Doty v. Rnssell, 5 Wend. 129.),The plaintiff, after filing a transcript of a justice's judg- ment, may issue an execution against the person, out of the county court, notwithstanding an execution was pre- viously issued in the court in which the judgment was recovered and the defendant discharged, without satisfac- tion. (Ginoc7eio v. Figari, 4 E. D. Smith, 227; 2 Abb. 185.),The recovery of a second judgment is no bar to the issuing of an execution upon the first, to obtain satisfac- tion of the debt. (Howard v. Shieldon, 11 Paige, 558; Andrewvs v. Smith, 9 Wend. 53; Mumiford v. Stocker, 1 Cow. 178; see Bates v. Lyons, 7 Paige, 85; Jac7Tson v. Shaffer, 11 Johns. 513; Doty v. Russell, 5 Wend. 129; Millard v. Whitaker, 5 Hill, 408.),Installments.]--When the debt for which a judgment is recovered is not all due, or is payable in installment, execution may issue thereon of course, as soon and a often as any part or installment becomes payable. (Cod Â§ 384; Monell v. Smith, 5 Cow. 441.) Thus, execu- tion may issue of course upon a judgment confessed to secure the judgment creditor against contingent 738
What may be enforced by. When issuablo. liability, as indorser on certain notes, whenever such liability becomes absolute in part, by reason of non- payment of some of the notes. (lonell v. Smith, 5 Cow. 441.),Against personal representatives.]-Execution cannot issue upon a judgment against an executor or adminis- trator, until an account of his administration has been rendered and settled, or unless the surrogate who ap- pointed him otherwise orders. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 174; [2 id. 88].) But this provision does not apply where the judg- ment is obtained against personal representatives in an action commenced by attachment against the decedent in his lifetime. (Thacher v. Bancroft, sp. t., 15 Abb. 243.),Such order may be granted at any time after the recovery of such judgment, after a trial upon the merits (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 204; [2 id. 116].),ART. 3.-When issuable. Under the Code of Procedure, execution is issuable at any time within five years after the entry of judgment. (Code, Â§ 283; Swift v. De Witt, 3 How. 280; 1 Code Iep. 25; see Catskill Bank v. Sanford, 4 How. 100; 2 Code Rep. 53.) But where the plaintiff stipulated, in consideration of a confession of judgment, not to issue execution for three years, an execution issued forthwith was set aside. (Mer- ritt v. Baker, sp. t., 11 How. 456.) Jludgnent roll filed.]-The judgment roll must be actually filed before execution can issue. (Tovnsliend v. Wesson, 4 Duer, 342; 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 638 [2 id. 360]; Code, Â§ 289; Barre v. Dana, 20 Johns. 307.) An execution is not issued until the time arrives at which the officer to whom it is delivered is expressly or tacitly directed to proceed with its enforcement. Hence au execution is properly issued, though delivered to the,739
When issuable. Judgment roll filed. Judgment dockete& sheriff before the roll is filed, if accompanied with direc. tions to him, which he obeys, to indorse it as received at a subsequent time, before which time the roll is actually filed. (Walters v. Farley, 22 Wend. 566.),Although the roll is not filed before the execution, if it is filed afterwards, the execution cannot be impeached as prematurely issued, either by the judgment debtor (Small v. McChesney, 3 Cow. 19; Clute v. Clute, 3 Den. 263), or by any person taking under him by an assign- ment executed after the filing of the roll (Clute v. Clut, 3 Den. 263), or by a judgment creditor whose judgment is perfected after such filing. (Clute v. Clute, 4 Den. 241.),The law will not notice fractions of a day, in order to determine whether the record was filed before issuing execution, where no injustice is done. (Small v. Meches- ney, 3 Cow. 19; Clute v. Cltte, 4 Den. 241; 3 id. 263.) An execution, issued before filing the judgment roll on which it is founded, is invalid against an execution issued before such filing, and on a prior judgment roll duly filed, although both judgment rolls were filed, and both execu- tions issued, on the same day. (Marvin v. Herrick, 5 Wend. 109.),Roll signed.]-Although proper, it is not indispensable, that the roll should also be signed; and if the clerk omits to sign it, a third person cannot object to an execution issued thereon, as void on that ground. (Van Alstynev. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489; Artisans' Bank v. Treadwell, 34 Barb. 553, 558.),Judgment docketed.]-A judgment for the payment of money should be docketed before execution issues thereo. (Code, Â§ 287,289.) But if an execution issues before dock- eting, and the judgment is afterward docketed, it will take priority over an execution regularly issued on a judg- ment entered and docketed after such docket. (Stoutten burgh v. Yandenburgh, sp. t., 7 How. 229, 233.) 740
When issuable. Judgment docketed. After death of debtor. It was held in Stepiens v. Browning (sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 123), that an execution against personal property only might be issued to any county, though the judgment had not been docketed there. This distinction was doubted, however, by HAnRIS, J. (Stozteniburg7h v. Yandeiiurghl, sp. t., 7. How. 229; see DeAgreda v. Mantel, sp. t., 1 Abb. 130,135.) Before the Code, an execution upon a Supreme Court judgment might be issued to any county in the State, though the judgment was not docketed in that county. (Youngs v. Morrison, 10 Paige, 325; Corey v. Cornelius, 1 Barb. Ch. R. 571; Clark v. Dakin, 2 id. 36.) But, unless so docketed, the execution bound only the interest of the defendant at the time of the seizure and sale. (Corey v. Cornelius, 1 Barb. Oh. R. 571.) Attachments.]-Where property of the judgment debtor has been attached, execution cannot issue against the debtor's property generally, until all the property attached, or its proceeds, have been applied on the judgment or ac- counted for. (See MLKay v. Harrowcr, 27 Barb. 471.),After death of debtor.]-Execution cannot issue within one year after the death of " the defendant" (which means, no doubt, the party against whom it is to issue), nor even then, without leave of the surrogate having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 642; Laws 1850, ch7. 295; see 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 649; [2 id. 368].) These provisions do not forbid the issuing of an execu- tion against the co-debtor of a deceased judgment debtor. (Day v. Rice, 19 Wend. 644.) It appears to be well settled that an execution tested before the death of the party, although issued afterwards, is regular (Hay v. Fowler, sp. t., 1. How. 127); but real property cannot be sold on an execution thus issued. (Stytets v. Brooks, 10 Wend. 206; Woodcock v. Bennett, 1 Cow. 711; Bennett v. Davis, 3 id. 68; Griswold v. Stewart, 4 id. 457.),741
When issuable. Leave to irsse execution. After death of creditor.]-An execution cannot issue upon a judgment in favor of a deceased person. (Jay v. Martine, 2 Duer, 654; Tl7rston v. King, sp. t., 1 Abb. 126; Wheeler v. Dalin, sp. t., 12 How. 537; see Irelaid v. Litc7lfield, 8 Bosw. 634; 22 How. 178; Bellinger v. Ford, 21 Barb. 311; Cameron v. Young, sp. t., 6 How. 372; Gerry v. Post, sp. t., 13 id. 118.) The executors or assignees must bring an action upon the judgment, in the nature of a scire facias. (lb.),ART. 4.-Leave to issue execution. Wlter necessary.]-.Execution may be issued without application to the court, for five years after the entry of judgment; and even afterwards, if an execution has been issued thereon within that period, and returned unsatis- sied in whole or in part, a new execution may issue as of course (Code, Â§ 284), and that not merely of the same species as the former execution, but of any other, war- ranted by the judgment. (See K;ress v. Ellis, sp. t., 14 How. 392.),The amendment of 1858, providing that no leave is necessary where an execution has been issued within the five years, adopts the construction given to the section before in Pierce v. Craine (sp. t., 4 How. 257), McSmith v. Van Delsen (sp. t., 9 id. 245), Kress v. Ellis (sp. t., 14 id. 392). These cases show that "the five years" mean the five years next after the judgment, and not next before the new execution.,As a general rule, irrespective of the provisions of the Code, it seems that after a lapse of ten years from the time of issuing an execution, a party should not be allowed to issue a second execution without leave of court, obtained on notice to the adverse party, and upon affidavit that the judgment remains unsatisfied. (Sacia v. Nestle, sp. t., 13 How. 572.),Execution cannot be issued without leave upon a judg ment or decree, which is, prima facie, discharged by a 742
Leave to issue execution. The motion. bankrupt certificate, so as to be no longer in existence as a subsisting debt against the judgment debtor. (Boyd v. Yzner-?jm.p, 1 Barb. Ch. B. 273; Alcott v. Avery, id. 347, 352.) The defendant may consent that execution issue, after the lapse of five years from the rendition of the judg- ment, and in such case, no order us the court is necessary. (Hulbut v. Fuller, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 55; see Howland v. Ralph, 3 Johns. 20: Merritt v. Wing, sp. t., 4 How. 14; 2 Code Rep. 20.),On judgment entete as security.]-lWhere the judgment is entered as security merely, the judgment creditor must move, on notice, for leave to issue execution, before doing so. (Dows v. Parker, 4 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 384; see Ford v. Whitridge, 9 Abb. 416.) On official bonds.]-The same rule applies to judgments upon official bonds, in favor of the people, and standing as security for subsequent recoveries. (Lewis v. Ball, 6 Cow. 583; People v. Birdsall, 20 Johns. 297.) But the party at whose suit such judgment was recovered, may obtain leave to issue execution, without notice. (People v. Mattheleson, 20 Johns. 300.),The mnotion.]-It is useless to move under Â§ 284 of the Code until after the five years have expired. Leave granted before their expiration cannot be availed of after- ward. (Field v. Pauldintg, 1 Hilt. 187; 3 Abb. 139.),The application for leave must be made to the court in which the judgment was rendered, except when the judg- ment of a justice's court, or of an inferior court in a city, has been docketed in the office of the clerk of the county; in such case it must be made to the county court of the county where the judgment was rendered, or, in New York city, to the Court of Common Pleas. (Code, ~ 284.) : Personal notice of such motion must be given to the,743

In what cases granted. adverse party, unless he is absent or non-resident, or can- not be found to make such service, in which case such service may be made by publication, or in such other manner as the court may direct. (Code, Â§ 284.) This is the rule whether the defendant appeared in the action or not.,The leave cannot be given unless it is established by the oath of the moving party, or by satisfactory proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, remains unsatis- sied and due. (Code, Â§ 284.) If the judgment debtor denies that anything is due on the judgment, or asserts that less is due than is claimed, the court will refer the matter to ascertain what, if anything, is due upon the judgment, before granting the motion; and if it is a proper case for leave to be granted, the court will direct that, on filing the referee's report, the judgment creditor have leave to issue execution for the amount reported due.,Upon the application, the court cannot go behind the judgment, or inquire into its validity, e. g., whether any summons was ever served upon the judgment debtor in the action. (Lee v. Watkins, sp. t., 3 Abb. 243; 13 How. 178.),In what cases granted.--Where a judgment remained unpaid more than five years, and after its recovery the judgment debtor obtained a discharge in insolvency, which was afterwards adjudged void, leave was granted to issue execution on the judgment. (Small v. Wheaton, 2 Abb. 316; 4 E. D. Smith, 427.) The discharge of a debtor imprisoned on execution under 2 R. S. 31, which discharge is void on its face for informalities, is no bar to granting leave to issue a new execution. (Browne v. Bradley, sp. t., 5 Abb. 141.),Leave may be had to issue execution on a judgment five years old, notwithstanding the judgment creditor has brought an action upon it, and obtained a new judgment therein. (Small v. Wheaton, 2 Abb. 316; 4 E. D. Smith, 427.) But where it appeared to the court upon the appli- 744

Executor. cation that the judgment debtor held a judgment against the appellant for a larger amount than that upon which the application was based, leave was not granted, but the party left to an action upon his judgment, in which the debtor might avail himself of his equitable set-off. (Betts v. Garr, 1 Hilt. 411.) Leave may be granted after the expiration of twenty years, but not unless there is proof of payment or written acknowledgment within that time. (Kennedy v. Mills, sp. t., 4 Abb. 132.),Effect of want of leave.]-Omission to obtain leave does not iender the execution absolutely void, but only voida- ble. (Bank of Genesee v. Spencer, 18 N. Y. 150; Bellinger v. Ford, 21 Barb. 311.) But it seems that an execution on a judgment obtained in a justice's court, issued with- out leave after more than five years have expired from the rendition of the judgment, is not merely irregular but void. (Bates v. James, 3 Duer, 45; Morse v. Goold, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 285.),ART. 5.-W-ho may issue execution. Attorney.]-An attorney, other than the one on record, may issue execution in his own name, on behalf of the judgment creditor, without being substituted. (Cook v. Dickerson, 1 Duer, 679; Thorp v. Fowder, 5 Cow. 346.) Of course the attorney of record may. A transcript of a justice's judgment having been filed in the county clerk's office, an attorney may issue execution thereon. (Simp- kins v. Page, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 107.) After the death of the judgment creditor, the attorney who obtained the judgment cannot issue execution there- on as such attorney. (Bellinger v. Ford, 21 Barb. 311, 314; and see ante, p. 742.) Executor.]-The executor of a deceased judgment creditor cannot issue an execution in the name of the creditor. (17T rston v. King, sp. t., 1 Abb. 126; Jay v.,94,745
Who may issue. By whom executed. Martine, 2 Duer, 654; see Wheeler v. Dakin, sp. t., 12 How. 537; Ireland v. Litclfield, 8 Bosw. 634; 22 How. 178.),Sheriff.]-A sheriff who has paid a fine to the judgment creditor to the amount of an execution issued to him, im- posed by the court for neglect of duty in regard to it, cannot enforce the execution against the debtor for his own indemnity. (Carpenter v. Stillwell, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 61; Craft v. Merrill, 14 id. [4 Kern.] 456.),AnT. 6.-By what officers the writ n~y be executed. Execution against the property of the judgment debtor may be issued to the sheriff of any county where judg. ment is docketed. (Code, Â§ 287; Hammond v. Mlthter, 2 Cow. 446.) An execution for the delivery of specific real or personal property must be issued to the sheriff of the county where the property, or some part of it, is situated. (Code, Â§ 287.),Executions may be issued at the same time to different counties. (Code, Â§ 287; Hammond v. Matter, 2 Cow. 456; 3 B. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364].),Sheriff out of office.]-A sheriff whose term of office has expired, must nevertheless complete the execution of all final process lodged with him while in office. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 738; [2 id. 439].),Against sheriff.]-On a judgment against a sheriff, either singly or with others, the execution may be issued to the coroner of the proper county (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 741, Â§ 109; [2 id. 441, Â§ 84]), or to any person, not a party in inter- est, whom the court, or a judge thereof, may designate by an order entered, in the former case, in the minutes, or, in the latter case, indorsed on the execution. (3 B. 8. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364].),After levy of attadhment.-Where an attachment against a foreign corporation has been levied, execution must be directed to the sheriff who made the levy, though he be 746

In general.]-The execution must be directed to the sheriff in all cases, except where the sheriff is a party. (See antte, p. 746.) It must be subscribed by the party issuing it, orhis attorney. It must refer to the judgment upon which it is issued, stating the court, the county where the judg- ment roll or transcript of a justice's judgment is filed, and the names of the parties; the amount of the judgment, if for money, and the sum actually due thereon; and the time of docketing in the county to which the execution is issued. (Code, Â§ 289.) It sLould conform to the judgment in all essential particulars (Jackson v. Page, 4 Wend. 585, 589; Gerry v. Post, sp. t., 13 How. 118, 122), that is, fol- low the judgment in its terms. (See Baldwin v. Kimmel, 16 Abb. 353, 360.) It was formerly held that an execu- tion for even less than the amount of the judgment was irregular, if the variance was unexplained (Webber v. Hiltchis, 8 Mees. & W. 319); but this is not so now.,The execution is the process of the court (Code, Â§ 286), and ought, therefore, to run in the name of the people of this state (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 467; [2 id. 275]); but an omission of their name is not material (Park v. Chuirch, sp. t., 5 How. 281); and it need not be sealed nor subscribed, except by the party issuing it, or his attorney (Code, Â§ 286); nor need it contain anything not expressly required by the Code, such as a teste (Park v. Church, sp. t., 5 How. 381), or directions as to the tire or place of its return. (Paake v. Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229; Park v. Church, supra; see Pierce v. Craine, sp. t., 4 How. 257.),It must be issued out of the same court in which the judgment was rendered. If issued out of another court, it is absolutely void. (Clarke v. Miller, 18 Barb. 269; see Field v. Paulding, 3 Abb. 139; 1 Hilt. 187.) But an exe- cution out of the county court, sealed with the Supreme,747
Form. On a justice's judgment. Instructions to sheriff. Court seal, was held not void. (Dominick v. Eacker, 3 Barb. 17.),On a justice's judgment.]-Where a justice's judgment is docketed with the county clerk, so as to become a judg- ment of the county court, the execution is subscribed by the county clerk. (Cole, Â§ 64.),On judgment by confession.]-An execution may issue on a judgment taken by confession, in the same manner as upon other judgments. But if the entire amount of the judgment is not due, the execution must be indorsed by the person issuing it with a direction to the sheriff to collect only the amount due, stating it, with interest and costs. A new execution maybe issued in like manner as each installment falls due. (Code, Â§ 384.),Indorsements.]-The execution should be indorsed with the title of the cause and the name and address of the party issuing it; and if for money, with a specialdirection to the sheriff to levy not only the amount to which the cred- itor is entitled, but also interest thereon from the time the judgment was docketed. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364].),Mistakes in.]-Variances between the judgment and exe- cution, which do not mislead, will be disregarded. (Swan v. Saddlemire, 8 Wend. 676; Jackson v. Anderson, 4 id. 474; Jackson v. Page, id. 585; Jac7kson v. Walker, id. 462.),ART. 8.--Instructions to s7erif. The judgment creditor, or his attorney, may require the sheriff or his deputy to carry out the execution in any particular mode, being lawful and reasonable, that such creditor or attorney deems fit. (Walters v. Sykes, 22 Wend. 566; Ford v. Leche, 6 Ad. & El. 699; Hamilton v. Dazliel, 2 H. Blacks. 952.),The effect of such instructions is to make the officer, to whom they are given, a mere agent for the party giving them (ib.; Mickles v. Hart, 1 Den. 548), provided such,EXECUTION IN GENERAL.
Instructions to sheriff. Receipt and return. officer follows or undertakes to follow them, but not other- wise (Sheldon v. Payne, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 453; see Walden v. Davison, 15 Wend. 575); and if such instructions are given to an under or deputy sheriff, modifying in any respect his legal obligations, the sheriff is not responsible to the creditor for his acts, while undertaking to carry them out. (Mickles v. Hart, 1 Den. 548; Ford v. Leche, supra; Hamilton v. Dalziel, supra.),If a deputy departs from the line of his duty, presum- ing upon the approval of the creditor, a ratification of his acts by the latter relieves the sheriff as effectually as an original instruction. (Corning v. Southland, 3 Hill, 552.),But mere information and advice to the deputy will not operate as a positive instruction, either to bind the deputy, or to discharge the sheriff. (Tuttle v. Cook, 15 Wend. 274.) And if, after giving instructions, the creditor directs the sheriff toproceed regardless of them, the liability of the latter revives thenceforward. (See Mickles v. Hart, 1 Den. 548.) But a mere direction to the deputy to proceed, after instructions delaying him, has no such effect. (lb.),A judgment creditor is not presumed to have directed the sheriff to levy on the goods of a person who is not the judgment debtor. (Averill v. Williams, 1 Den. 501.),The party issuing the execution is not bound to notify the officer that the judgment debtor resides or has pro- perty in the county, and his omission to do either forms no excuse for the sheriff's negligence in not collecting it. (Tomlinson v. Rowe, Hill & D. Supp. 410.),A sheriff who enforces an execution, notwithstanding an order to the contrary from the creditor, is a mere tres- passer. (Barker v. St. Quintin, 12 Mees. & W. 441.),ART. 9.-Receipt and return. Indorsement of receipt.]-Upon the receipt of an execu- tion by the sheriff, it is his duty to indorse thereon the year, month, day and hour when he received the same. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364].),749
Return. By and to whom to be made. What to contain. The officer's indorsement is conclusive evidence against him that the execution was then in his hands. (Williams v. Lowudies, 1 Hall, 579, 597.),Rettur.]-The sheriff or other officer receiving the execution, must make a return of his proceedings thereon, in writing. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 739; [2 id. 440].),By and to 7wlomw to be nade.]-The execution must be returned by the officer to whom it was delivered, to the clerk with whom the judgment record is filed. (Code, Â§ 290.),If the officer dies before he has returned the execution, it seems that his personal representatives are the proper persons to return it. (See Cairns v. Smiith, 8 Johns. 337.),W7ten return to be malde.]-The execution must be returned within sixty days after its receipt by the officer. (Code, Â§ 290.) It is not necessary, lowever, that the exe- cution should remain in the hands of the officer sixty days; he may return it sooner, at his own risk. (Sorbes v. Wallr, 25 N. Y. 430; ilforange v. Edwards, 1 E. D. Smith, 414; Fake v. Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229.) And the objection that the writ was returned before the expira- tion of the sixty days cannot be raised collaterally. It can only be available on a direct motion to set aside the return, made by the debtor himself. (Tyler v. Willis or Whitnley, 33 Barb. 327; 12 Abb. 465; Sterling v. Levy, 10 Abb. 426; see Fenton v. Flagg, 24 How. 499.),What to contain.]-The return should contain a state- ment of the proceedings taken on the execution by the officer to whom it was delivered, and must be signed by him. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 739; [2 id. 440].),It is not necessary to describe particularly, in the return, the lands, if any, sold. (Jackson v. Walker, 4 Wend. 462.),The officer may return nulla bolna, even after levy, if an attempt to sell would be fruitless by reason of pre- vious liens. (Champeiwis v. White, 1 Wend. 92.)
Return by mail. Enlarging time. Compelling return. Return by mlail.]-An execution may be returned by mail, when the officer making the return resides in a different place from that in which the clerk's office to which the return is to be made is located, if there is a regular mail communication between such places. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 739; Laws 1850, ch. 225.) Such return is not, however, valid, unless inclosed in an envelope, properly directed, deposited in the post office nearest or most con- venient to such officer, and the postage thereon prepaid. ([b.; Jenl7ins v. McGill, sp. t., 4 How. 205.),Enlargilzg time.]-If the officer levies on property which is claimed by a third person, the court on motion will enlarge the time for making a return until the right is tried between the parties, or the sheriff receives a suffi- cient indemnity. (See Bayley v. Bates, 8 Johns. 185; Williams v Lowndes, 1 Hall, 579, 597.) Comnelling return.]-If the officer neglects to return the execution according to the requisition of the statute, he renders himself liable to an attachment or an action, at the election of the party aggrieved. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 739; [2 id. 440]; Wilson v. Wright, sp. t., 9 How. 459.) But he cannot be compelled to make his return until the sixty days have fully expired. (See Spencer v. Ciyler, 17 How. 157; 9 Abb. 382.) The officer is liable for not returning an execution delivered to his deputy. whether the former has acted upon it (People v. Waters, 1 Johns. Oas. 137; Cole. Gas. 76) or not. (People v. Brown, 6 Cow. 41.) The. practice in case an attachment is resorted to, is to serve notice on the officer to return the execution within ten days, or show cause why an attachment should not issue. (Rule 8, Supreme Ct.) It is no objection to a motion for an attachment against an officer for not return- ing an execution, that an action is pending against him,751
Return. Further return. Omission to return. for a failure to make such return. (Jenl7;ns v. M.cGii, sp. t., 4 How. 205; see Dygert ads. Crane, 1 Wend. 534, 538.),Further etutr9n.]-The court has no power to compel a sheriff who has returned an execution, to return a further specification of the property sold and its price, to enable the party to sue him (Shindler v. Blunt, 1 Sands. 683); except where he makes a return so evasive that the party cannot safely proceed against him for a false return, in which case lie may be required to perfect his return. (Davis v. Weybuarn, sp. t., 1 How. 153.),Omission to return, 7how excused.]-An order staying proceedings will excuse the sheriff for making no return, during the time it is in force, and he is entitled to proof that it has been vacated before an attachment can lie. (People v. Carnley, sp. t., 3 Abb. 215.) But suing out a writ of error will not excuse a neglect to return the exe cution, unless the return has been stayed by bail. (People v. Allen, 9 Wend. 224.),Where the plaintiff has directed the execution to be renewed, he cannot maintain an action for not returning the first execution. (Iloma) v. Liswiell, 6 Cow. 659.),Where the judgment creditor requested the sheriff to do certain things in reference to the proceedings to col- lect the execution, which he knew must require its reten- tion beyond its return day, it was held to be good ground for granting a new trial on a verdict against the sheriff. (Huzmphrey v. Hathorn, 24 Barb. 278.),An order for the payment into court of the money col- lected on an execution, complied with by the sheriff, will protect him. (Aclier v. Ledyard, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 62.),Canlceling.]-The court has power to authorize a sheriff to withdraw from the files an execution, and cancel the return. (Baker v. Binninger, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 270.)
Wrongful executions and liability therefor. Who is liable. ART. 10.-Wrongful arecutions and liability therefor. After judgment extinguished.]--A creditor issuing an execution upon a judgment which has been extinguished by a valid discharge in bankruptcy, is a trespasser, even if he has no knowledge of the discharge. (Rtuckman v. Cowell, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 505; 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 7.) Though an execution issued upon a judgment which has been satisfied by payment, is to be considered abso- lutely void, and not voidable, and a purchaser under it acquires no title (Carpenter v. Stilwell, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 61, 71; Stian v. Sawldlemire, 8 Wend. 676, 681; Jac7;sot v. Cadwell, 1 Cow. 622; Jackson v. Anderson, 4 Wend. 474, 480), yet an action will lie for selling under such an exe- cution. (Swan v. Saddleni ire, 8 Wend. 676.) And an action for trespass will lie against an officer who directs the taking of the judgment debtor's property, after such pay- ment. (Shermlan v. Boyce, 15 Johns. 443.) JTudgmentt erro~neous.]-The fact that a judgment is erro- neous, and is reversed for error after execution issued, does not render the execution wrongful, provided the judgment was erroneous only and not void. (Kissock v. Grant, 34 Barb. 144.),Who is liable.]-If the creditor directs a wrongful levy, although such direction will not be presumed (Averill v. Williams, 1 Den. 501), he is a trespasser equally with the officer. (Judson v. Cook, 11 Barb. 642; Stewart v. Wells, 6 Barb. 79; Davis v. Netwir7k, 5 Den. 92; Fonda v. Van Horne, 15 Wend. 631.) So are the principal and surety in a bond of indemnity. (Herring v. Hoppoc7e, 15 N. Y. 409.) But the fact that the attorney of the plaintiff in the execution interfered in the wrongful sale, will not of itself render the plaintiff liable. (Averill v. Williams, 4 Den. 295.) Nor will an action lie against the plaintiff, or,95,753
Remedies against execution. Setting aside his attorney, for merely not countermanding an execution after its return day. (Fail v. Lewvis, 4 Johns. 450.),ART. 11.-Remedies against execution. Setting aside.]-The execution may be set aside on motion, if it was irregularly issued (Read v. Mar71e, 3 Johns. 523; 1 Arehb. Pr. (7th ed.) 417), as where it varies from the record (Oa7key v. Becker, 2 Cow. 454), or is issued for too much (Monel v. Smith, 5 Cow. 441; see Peck v. 'Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 451; Green v. Beals, 2 Caines, 254); though an indorsement for a larger sum than is due has been held no ground for setting aside judgment and execution, when the execution was returned unsatisfied. (Barnard v. Darling, sp. t., 1 How. 223.) And so if it is issued before judgment is perfected (Marvin v. Herric, 5 Wend. 109), or while the judgment is secured on appeal (Davies v. Skidmore, 5 Hill, 501), or before a previous execution issued to the same county is returned (Cairns v. Sminth, 8 Johns. 337; Dorland v. Dorland, 5 Cow. 417; Ledyard v. Buckle, 5 Hill, 571), or when the lien of the judgment has ceased by lapse of time (Wilson v. Smith, sp. t., 2 Code R. 18), or when issued contrary to an agree- ment under which judgment was entered. (Sizer v. Mil ler, sp. t., 2 How. 44.),But an execution will not be set aside for an informality of the verdict, arising from a mere clerical mistake in its entry. (Updegroff v. Judges of Niagara, 3 Cow. 31.),If the judgment is set aside as irregular, the execution will, of course, be also set aside. (Lambert v. Converse, sp. t., 22 How. 265; Rob v. Moffat, 3 Johns. 257.),A new execution levied on personal property covered by a receivership obtained by the execution creditor, will be set aside unless he will waive his receivership, and his creditor's suit under which the receiver was appointed. (Gouverneur v. Warner, 2 Sands. 624.) 754
Remedies against. Betting aside. Stay of execution. Whio iay mnove.]-A motion on the ground of mere irregularity, can be made only by a party or privy to the record. (Gouverneulr v. Warner, 2 Sands. 624; Jones v. Cook, 1 Cow. 309.) A judgment creditor has no right to move to set aside a writ in another suit against his debtor. (Oakley v. Becker, 2 Cow. 452.) Objections to enforcing an execution upon real property cannot be raised by strangers to the execu- tion. (Smith v. .AcGowan, 3 Barb. 404; Tufts v. Tufts, 18 Wend. 621.) So the execution will not be set aside for irregularity on motion of a third person, who alleges fraud and collusion between the plaintiff and defendant. i(Howland v. Ralph, 3 Johns. 20; but see Smith v. Page, 15 Johns. 395.) A mortgagee is not entitled, as such, to move to set aside an execution as irregularly issued, after the debtor's death, without proceedings in the nature of a sci.fa. (Frinuk v. Morrison, sp. t., 13 Abb. 80.) A party against whom execution is issued on an un- authorized judgment, may move to set it aside, without showing that he may sustain actual injury therefrom (Lambert v. Converse, sp. t., 22 How. 265); and so an irregular execution must be set aside, whether any levy could be made under it or not. (Davies v. Skidwmore, 5 Hill, 501.) A judgment debtor who has assigned his property to a receiver appointed in a creditor's suit brought by the judgment creditor, may move to set aside a new execu- tion levied by the creditor, during the pendency of the creditor's suit, on property covered by such receivership. (Gouverneur v. Warner, 2 Sands. 624.) Stay of execution.-The court may, by virtue of its general control over its own process, stay execution when it is made the instrument of injustice, and especially of fraud. (1 Burr. Pr. 292.) This is clearly the proper remedy where the execution is regular, though the prac- tice has not been uniform. Such is therefore the proper,755

After discharge. course where a bankrupt's or insolvent's discharge is the ground of motion (see infra); or where a regular execu. tion is enforced against property not belonging to the debtor (Davis v. Tiffany, 1 Hill, 642); or where thejudg. ment has been satisfied in fact, though not of recprd.,,A stranger to the action, whose property is levied upon by the sheriff, on a claim of title in the judgment debtor, may make this motion for his own protection. (Davisv. Tiffany, 1 Hill, 642.*),If the facts are perfectly clear, in favor of the mover, a perpetual stay will be granted; but if there is any doubt upon the subject, a stay should be granted only until the question can be tested by action (Lansing v. Orcott, 16 Johns. 4); or issues may be framed for trial by a jury. (Stuart v. Salhinger, 14 Abb. 291; Cramer v. --- , 3 Sands. 700.),After discharge.]-Where a debtor has been discharged from the debt in bankruptcy or insolvency, too late to enable him to plead the discharge, he may obtain a per- petual stay of execution on motion (Gratuim v. Pierson, 6 Hill, 247; Baker v. Taylor, 1 Cow. 165), or have it set aside (Wall v. Thorn, sp. t., 14 Abb. 292 n.; lMailhattan Oil Co. v. Thorn, sp. t., 14 Abb. 291 n.; Bich v. Salinger, sp. t., 14 Abb. 294 n.; 11 id. 344; Parkinson v. Scoville, 19 Wend. 150; Palmer v. Hutchins, 1 Cow. 42); but not if he had a fair opportunity to plead it. (Price v. Peters, 15 Abb. 197; Lee v. Phillips, 6 Hill, 246; Post v. Biley, 18 Johns. 54; Mechanics' Bank v. Hazard, 9 id. 392; Cross v. Hobson, 2 Cai. 102; see Alcott v. Avery, 1 Barb. Oh.

Armstrong, sp. t., 10 Abb. 458; Reed v. Gordon, 1 Cow. 50), or fraud. (Noble v. J7oh1son, 9 Johns. 259.) But where a strong presumption of fraud is raised, the court may deny the motion, unless the debtor will consent to have issues framed and tried by a jury. (Stuart v. Salhin- ger, 14 Abb. 291; Cramer v. - , 3 Sands. 700.),ART. 12.-Newi executions. WTlecn alloiced.]-A new execution may issue at any time, provided the last preceding execution was returned unsatisfied. (Code, Â§ 284; see Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 451.) When execution has been issued on a judg- ment witlin five years after its entry, and returned unsat- isfied in whole or in part, a new execution may issue thereon of course. (Code, Â§ 284.) 'But if the execution first issued was void, a new execution should not be issued without leave. (Suydam v. Holden, 4 Seld. Notes, 16; see Field v. Paulding, 1 Hilt. 187; 3 Abb. 139.) After levy (Dorland v. Dorland, 5 Cow. 417; Ledyard v. Btlckle, 5 Hill, 571), or levy and sale upon one execution, another cannot issue to the same county upon the same judgment, without leave, until the first has been returned. (Cairns v. Sit7t, 8 Johns. 337; Cutler v. Colver, 3 Cow. 30; Cumlstont v. Field, 3 Wend. 382.) And such leave will not be granted except in a case of necessity. (See Led- yard v. Buckle, 5 Hill, 571.) But, if good cause is shown, such leave will be granted. Thus, in Jaclson v. Stiles (9 Johns. 391), the court allowed the plaintiff to have a second execution for delivery of possession of real pro- perty before the first was returned. (See Cunmpston v. Field, 3 Wend. 382.) Where a purchaser of real property evicted for irregu-,757

(5th ed.) 658; [2 id. 375].) And where the plaintiff is compelled, by judgment rendered against him, to refund to a third per- son a portion of the property sold under the execution,ho may issue another execution for the amount so refunded, without leave. (Ric7uardson v. McDougall, 19 Wend. 80.) So, where the plaintiff was compelled to refund the value of the whole of the property sold, leave was granted to cancel the return and issue execution for the whole amount due on the judgment. (Adams v. Smith, 5 Cow. 280.,A new execution cannot issue as of course to collect a balance due on a judgment, after an execution has issued indorsed for the levy of an amount less than that to which the party is entitled (People v. Onondaga C. P., 3 Wend. 331); but leave may be granted to issue execution when the first execution was issued for the less amount by mistake. (People v. Cihantauqe C. P., 1-Wend. 73.),A judgment creditor having commenced a creditor's action, and obtained an assignment of the judgment debtor's property to a receiver, cannot levy an alias exe- cution on personal property covered by such receivership. (Go uverneur v. Warner, 2 Sands. 624.),In the event of the escape of an imprisoned debtor, or of his decease while in custody, a new execution may issue. (3 RS.S.

(Altscott v. Woolcorth, 14 How. 477, Dubois v. Dubois, 6 Cow. 494; see Belts v. Hoyt, 19 Barb. 412.),Money deposited with a banker cannot be levied upon by virtue of an execution against the depositor. (Carroll v. Cone, 40 Barb. 220.),Growing crops.]-A growing crop raised annually by labor and cultivation is, as respects an execution against the owner, a mere chattel, and subject as such to be taken and sold under it. (Shepard v. Philbric7, 2 Den. 174; Whipple v. Foot, 2 Johns. 418; Stewart v. Doughty, 9 id. 108.) But natural products of the earth which grow without cultivation, such as grass, cannot be levied on before severance, even by permission of the debtor. (Bank of Lansilngbuygh v. Crary, sp. t., 1 Barb. 542.),Things in action.]--A mere thing in action, e. g., a pro- missory note, is not subject to levy. (Bogert v. Perry, 17 Johns. 351; Ingalls v. Lord, 1 Cow. 240.)

Dettlebach, sp. t., 11 How. 47; seeWalsh v. Adams, 3 Den. 128; Phillips v. Cook, 24 Wend. 398.) But such levy cannot be made after the partnership accounts have been taken in an action for a dissolution. (See Moody v. Payne, 2 Johns. Ch. 548.) On an execution against joint property, individual property cannot be taken. (Sherry v. Schuyler, 2 Hill, 204.) Pro- perty belonging to a limited partnership may be levied on, before an order is made for the appointment of a receiver, although the partnership is insolvent. (Van Als- tyne v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489.),On an execution against joint debtors, the court will not inquire into the state of the accounts between them. The creditor has a right to direct a levy upon the joint or several property, of any or all of the debtors. (Godfrey v. Gibbons, 22 Wend. 569.),Wife's property.]-Where it did not appear that the wife had a separate estate, it was held that chattels purchased by her, but in the husband's possession, were liable to be sold on execution against him.

Striker, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 19; 1 E. D. Smith, 321; see 3 R. S. (5th7 ed.) 21; [1 id. 729, Â§ 60]), or in a trust valid as a power in trust (see 3 B. S. (5th ed.) 26; [1 id. 735, Â§ 103]), cannot be levied on; but when a trust is merely formal and passive, the interest of the beneficiary is subject to levy. (3 R. S.

The estate of a trustee cannot be sold on an execution issued on a judgment against him in an action for the recovery of money, even if he is described as such trus- tee. (See Mallory v.

Green, 32 Barb. 448, 459.),Interests of mortgaqgor and mortgagee.]-An equity of redemption is real estate, and, under the statute, may be sold on execution against the mortgagor in possession. (Waters v. Stewiart, 1 Cai. Cas. 47.) But on an execution against the mortgagee, the mortgaged land cannot be sold until a foreclosure, notwithstanding the mortgage debt is due. (Joac,7son v. Wrillard, 4 Johns. 41.),A judgment recovered for a debt secured by mortgage, is not a lien on the mortgaged premises, and the equity of redemption cannot be sold under an execution thereon. (3 R. S.

(5th ed.) 645, 646; [2 id. 367]); and such articles thereof as are movable, continue exempt while the family of the householder, or any of them, are removing from one place of residence to another. (Ib.; Woodward v. lMurray, 18 Johns. 400.),A "householder" means the head, master, or person who has charge of, and provides for a family (Bowne v. Witt, 19 Wend. 475), or a person having, and providing for, a household, e. g., a widower who provides for his two children. (GriSfi v. Sutherland, 14 Barb. 456.) This character is not lost by temporarily ceasing housekeeping, and storing property with a view to renew housekeeping (ib.), or by keeping a house of ill fame (Bovwmanl v. Qluacl- enboss, 3 Code Rep. 17), or by a widow's remarrying and taking her second husband into her household, she con- tinuing to provide for her minor children by the first husband. (Brigham v.

All sheep to the number of ten, with their fleeces, and the yarn or cloth manufactured from the same (lb.), wheth- er coming from sheep belonging to the owner of the fleeces, yarn or cloth, or not (Hall v. Penney, 11 Wend. 44; Brackett v. Watkins, 21 id. 68); one cow, two swine, and the necessary food for them (3 B. S., supra) until the next foddering season, or until they are slaughtered, if slaugh- tered before that time (Farrell v. Higley, Hill & D. Supp. 87); and so much pork, beef, fish, flour and vegetables (3 R. S., supra), whether in or out of the ground (Car- lenter v. Herringto)i, 25 Wend. 370), actually provided for family use, as will be necessary (3 R. S., supra) for the family until the next annual period for laying up such provisions (Farrell v. Higley, supra); and necessary fuel for sixty days use of the family. (3 R. S., supra.),5. All necessary wearing apparel, beds, bedsteads and bedding for such person and his family, arms and accou- trements required by law to be kept by such person, necessary cooking utensils, one table, six chairs, six knives and forks, six plates, six teacups and saucers, one sugar- dish, one milk-pot, one tea-pot and six spoons, one crane and its appendages, one pair of andirons, and a shovel and tongs. (3 1B. S., supra.),6. The tools and implements of any mechanic, neces- sary to the carrying on of his trade, not exceeding twenty- five dollars in value. (Ib.),In addition to these articles, the following articles, to the value of not exceeding $250, are also exempt from ex- ecution, when owned by a person being a householder, or having a family for which he provides. (Laws 1859, ch. 134; amending 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 646; Laws 1842, c7i. 157.),1. Necessary household furniture (Ib.), e. g., a watch hung up for use, in the house of a family having no clock, and whose daily avocations are such that a time- piece is indispensable. (See Bitting v.

Moul, 15 Abb. 6); e. g., a tow-line used by a canal boatman (lb.), or the surgical instruments of a physician (Robin- SOn.'S Case, sp. t., 3 Abb. 466), or a watch necessarily used in business (see Bitting v. YValenburyg, 17 How. 80); but not a threshing machine. (Ford v. Johnson, 34 Barb. 364.),3. A necessary team (3 R. S. supra), whether belonging to a laborer, or to a professional man. (Van Bnlrel v. Loper, 29 Barb. 388; Easttman v. Caswell, 8 How. 75; WhYceler v. Cropsey, 5 How. 288.) The term "team" embraces a horse or horses, or other draft animals, harness therefor, and the vehicle usually attached thereto, or either of them separately (Dains v. Prosser, 32 Barb. 290;* Ilutc7tlnson v. CIhamnberlin, 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 248; Iartholise v. likers, 1 Duer, 606; 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 223); e. g., a single horse (Lockwood v. Yotunglove, 27 id. 505; lIoyt v. Va1lnAstyne, 15 Barb. 568; Wheeler v. Crop- sey, 5 How. 288), although invariably used with another, belonging to a third person (Lockwood v. Yolungkve, supra), a harness (Harthlouse v. Rikers, supra,), a buggy (VTa Bluren V. Loper, 29 Barb. 388), wagon (Dains v. Prosser, 32 id. 290), gig (Eastmana v. Caswiell, 8 How. 75) or cart. (Ilartloutse v. Bikers, supra.),Necessary food for the team, for not exceeding ninety days, is also exempt. (Laws of 1859, supra.t),The ftuniture, tools, team and food therefor, last above mentioned, are exempt only when owned, in whole, or in part (Radcliff v. Wood, 25 Barb. 52; see Loc7kiood v. Yoimglove, 27 id. 504), by "a person being a householder," or "having a family for which he provides." (Laws of 1842 and 1859, supra;) These terms are not synonymous, but each is intended to designate persons who might not be included by the other. (Hutclhisont v. Chanmberlin, 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 248.),* Overruling Aforse v. Keyes (G How. 18). t Superseding Rue v. Alter (5 Den. 119). 768
Exemptions in favor of householders. Exceptions. One who lives in his hired house, and keeps boarders and has servants, is a householder, although he has no wife or children (Ib.; Fan Fechten v. Hall, sp. t., 14 How. 435); but he is not considered as having a family, even though he provides for his housekeeper's children. (Van Yechten v. Hall, supra.) One who has two children, for whom he provides, is a person having a family (Robinson's Case, sp. t., 3 Abb. 466; Griffin v. Sutherland, 14 Barb. 456), although the children are temporarily absent to be educated (Robin- son's case, supra), or although he and his children are temporarily absent together. (Griffin v, Sutherland, supra.) So is a widower, having one daughter whom he supports (Cox v. Stafford, sp. t., 14 How. 521), or a man who lives with his wife, but who has no children. (See lb.),The articles exempted by the laws of 1842 and 1859 are exempt, although the execution issues to enforce a right acquired before the passage of the exemption act. (Morse v. Goold, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 281, overruling Danks v. Quackenbtush, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 129; see Wheeler v. Cropsey, 5 How. 291.) Exceptions: domestic servants.]-The articles exempted by the laws of 1842 and 1859 are not exempt from an execution under a judgment obtained on a claim for work and labor performed in the debtor's family as a domestic. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 646; Laws 1858, oh. 107.) Exceptions: jurchase-money.]--If the execution issues on a demand for the purchase-money of any of the arti- cles exempted by the laws of 1842 and 1859, that article (Laws of 1842 and 1859, supra; ficlcox v. Pay, 36 Barb. 9), or any other of those articles (Craft v. Curtiss, 25 How. 163;. TVa Buren v. Loper, 29 Barb. 388; Hutchin- son v. Chamberlain, 11 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 248; Barnes v.

Stafford, sp. t., 14 How. 519), or other articles exempt by the Revised Statutes (ib.; Cole v. Stevens, 9 Barb. 676; 6 How. 424), cannot be.,The words "demand for the purchase-money" mean the original demand for the property sold, and do not extend to a demand on a security given for the purchase- money. (Davis v. Peabody, 10 Barb. 91.),An execution issued in an action for taking and con- verting personal property is not issued on a demand for its purchase-money, the action in effect repudiating all idea of a sale. (Hoyt v. Van Alstyne, 15 Barb. 568.),Homestead.]-A homestead, owned and occupied by a householder having a family, is also exempt to the value of one thousand dollars, from the operation of an execu- tion on debts contracted, if the conveyance of the same shows that it is designed to be held as a homestead, or a notice to that effect, executed and acknowledged by the owner, is recorded. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 647; Laws 1850, ch. 260.),The homestead act does not exempt any property from sale for non-payment of taxes, or assessments, or for a debt contracted for the purchase thereof, or prior to the recording of the deed or notice, declaring such property to be owned and occupied as a homestead (ib.), or prior to the passage of the act. (lb.; see Sc1outon v. Kiliner, sp. t., 8 How. 527.),The homestead is not exempt from execution issued upon a judgment obtained in an action for a wrong, 770
Exempt property. Homestead. Other exemptions. whether for damages or costs (Robinson v. Wiley, 15 N. Y. 489; Schouton v. Kiilmer, sp. t., 8 How. 527), or in an action for breach of promise of marriage. (Cook v. New- man, sp. t., 8 How. 523.),The exemption of a homestead does not constitute an incumbrance, claim or lien on the premises. (Robinson v. Wiley, 19 Barb. 157; see S. C., 15 N. Y. 489.) The exemption extends only to sale on execution, and does not prevent a judgment from being a lien on the property (Allen v. Cook, 26 Barb. 374; Smlith v. Brackett, 36 id. 571); so that, although the judgment cannot be enforced while the exemption continues, it takes preced- ence over a subsequent mortgage. (Smith v. Brackett, supra.) This right of exemption can be released or waived by the owner of the homestead (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 647; Laws 1850, ch. 260; Smith v. Bracktett, 36 Barb. 571), and can- not be set up by a grantee of the homestead. (Allen v. Cook, 26 id. 374.) The widow of the householder owning the homestead is entitled to the benefit of the exemption, if she or some one of the family continues to occupy it. (3 R. S., supra.) Burying-ground.]-Land, to the extent of a quarter of an acre, set apart for a family or private burying ground, and a portion of which has been actually used as such, is exempt; provided a description of the land has been recorded in a special manner. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 646; Laws 1847, ch. 85.) Building association slhares.]-Shares in a building asso- ciation to the value of $600 are exempt. (Laws 1851, ch. 122.) Materials for canals.]-All materials procured, or par- tially procured, under a contract with the canal commis- sioners, are exempt from execution. (1 R. S. (5th ed.) 586; [1 id. 223].),771
Exempt property. Evidence. Selection. Exemption a question of fact.]-The question whether an article is exempt, is one of fact for the jury (Dains v. Prosser, 32 Barb. 290, 291), as, for example, whether an article is exempt, as necessary. (Willson v. Ellis, 1 Den. 462; Wheeler v. Cropscy, 5 How. 288, 291; WtWitmarsl v. Angle, 3 Code Rep. 53; Griffin v. Suith7erland, supra.),Burden of proof.]-The person who claims that an arti- cle is exempt, holds the burden of proof (Daises v. Pros- ser, 32 Barb. 290, 291; Carlrick v. Myers, 14 id. 9; Griffi v. Sutherland, id. 456); thus, articles claimed to be exempt as necessary cooking utensils, must be shown affirmatively to be necessary; it is not sufficient to show that they are usefil. (Van, Sickcler v. Jacobs, 14 Johns. 434.),Evidence.]-In determining whether an article is exempt because necessary, it is immaterial whether the debtor has or has not other ample means to pay the debt for which the execution issues. (Whtceler v. Cropsey, 5 How. 288.) What is necessary for a householder and his family is to be determined by a reference to circumstances. Such articles, so exempt, may be of a character reasonable and proper for him and them in respect of their station in life. (Dickerson v. Van Tine, 1 Sands. 724.),Evidence as to the custom of employers to remove the tools of their mechanics, is admissible to show that a horse and wagon is not necessary for the mechanic. (Whit- marsh v. Angle, 3 Code Rep. 53.),Selection by debtor.]-To a reasonable extent the judg- ment debtor can select such articles as may be claimed by him as exempt. (Dickerson v. Tan: Tine, 1 Sands. 724; Seaman v. Lzce, 23 Barb. 240; Lockwood v. Yoinoglove, 27 id. 504.),It seems the debtor should make his election at the time of the levy, or within a reasonable time after notice of the levy (Seaman v. Luce, supra); and that, if he does 772

Keyes, 6 How. 18.),Firaud.]-If it is proved that the plaintiff has reduced himself to exempt property, in order to defraud his cred- itors, the jury may place him beyond the reach of the statute, by sustaining the levy. (Braccett v. Watkins, 21 Wend. 68.),Statute liberally constrtued.]-The statute in regard to exempt property is remedial, and should be liberally con- strued. (Ford v. John7sol, 34 Barb. 364; Carpenter v. Har- rilgton, 25 Wend. 370; Griffin v. Suttherland, 14 Barb. 456; Robinson's Case, sp. t., 3 Abb. 466; but see Allen v. Cook, 26 Barb. 374, 379.),T7lo may claiml exelmption.]-The exemption of property from execution by statute is a personal privilege, of which the owner alone can take advantage. (Smith v. Hill, 22 Barb. 656; Earl v. Calmp,) 16 Wend. 562; l1ickles v. Tous- ley, 1 Cow. 114.),Waiver of exemption..]-The owner cannot waive the exemption by a prior contract (KnXeetle v. 2eeltcotlb, 22 N. Y. 249; 31 Barb. 169; Crauford v. Lociwood, 9 How. 547; Harper v. Leal, sp. t., 10 id. 276; see contra, Case v. Dun- tlore, 23 Penn. St. 93), though he iiay do so at the time of the levy.,A wife cannot, without special authority, waive her husband's claim of exemption (Woodwiart v. Mujrray, 18 Johns. 400), even for the purpose of preserving from levy property that is not exempt. (Ib.) A waiver of a claim of exemption, which is to continue until a certain day, unless the execution is paid, does not authorize a sale to be made at a later day, after payment. (Carnrick7 v. Myers, 14 Barb. 9,),773
EXECUTION AGAINST PROPERTY. Form of execution. Against all the debtors.,A.w.r-. 4.-Form of execution.* An execution against property must direct the officer to satisfy the judgment out of the personal property of the debtor; and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, out of the real property belonging to him, on the day when the judgment was docketed in his county, or at any time thereafter.

W. STFVENS,,Plaintif"'s Attorney. *For general rules in relation to the form of executions, see ante, p. 747.,a
Form. After attachment. Against joint debtors. After attachment.]-Where property has been attached, the execution should recite the attachment and the pro- ceedings under it, and should require the officer to satisfy the judgment (or, in case the officer has paid over any proceeds of property sold or collected by him, the balance remaining due on such judgment), out of the property attached by him, if that property can be found (Code, Â§ 237; see 3lMKay v. Harrower, 27 Barb. 470); or the exe- cution may be general, but limited by indorsement to the property held under the attachment. (Thatcher v. Bancroft, sp. t., 15 Abb. 243.) It should be made returnable when fully executed. (Ib.) Joint debtors.]-The Revised Statutes directed that, where the judgment was against joint debtors, the execu- tion, though in form issued against all of the defendants, should have indorsed thereon the names of such of the defendants as were not served with the original process, with a direction that the execution be not served on such defendants. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 660; [2 id. 377].) The Code (Â§ 136) modifies this provision so far as not to require an absolute direction not to serve the execution upon the defendants not served with process. The execution may run against all the joint property of the defendants, in the hands of any of them, and may therefore be served upon any of them, though it cannot affect the. individual property of the defendants not served with the summons.,Against property in the hands of third persons.]-If the execution is issued against real or personal property in the hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real property, or trustees, it must require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of the property which, according to the judgment, is liable for iti satisfaction. (Code, Â§ 289, subd. 2; OmInsted v. Yreden- burgh, sp. t., 10 How. 215.) Thus, an execution against property on a judgment against an executor as such,775
Form. Against third persons. Married woman. should require the sheriff to collect from the assets of the deceased in the hands of the defendant as executor. It is not enough that the execution describes the defendant in his representative capacity. (Olmstcd v. Yredenburgh, sp. t., 10 How. 217.) So if an execution on a judgment against a receiver is issued against his individual pro- perty without the order of the court, it will be irregular. (Marsh v. Hussey, 4 Bosw. 614.),Against heirs or devisees.]-An execution against heirs or devisees must be indorsed with the names of such of the defendants as are infants, with a direction net to exe- cute the same against such infants until one year after judgment rendered. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 752; [2 id. 455]; see Id. 649; [2 id. 368]; see also S1eoo7ce v. Phillips, 5 Cow. 440.) It is not enough, in such a case, that the exe- cution describes the defendants in their representative capacity. (Olmsted v. Vredenburgh, sp. t., 10 How. 215.),Mortgage debt.]-An execution on a judgment for a debt secured by mortgage should be indorsed with a direction not to levy on the mortgaged premises, giving a brief description thereof, and referring to the page and book in which the mortgage is recorded. (3 R..S. (5th ed.) 649; [2 id. 368].),Against a married womanl--In an execution against the property of a married woman, the officer must be directed to levy and collect the :amount of the judgment from her separate property, and not otherwise (Code, Â§ 287;* see Â§ 274, subd. 4; Baldwin v. Kimmel, 16 Abb. 353, 360); but this direction is not essential, and if omitted the execution will not be invalid on that ground. (Thomp- son v. Sargent, sp. t., 15 Abb. 452; Monerief v. Ward, sp. t., 16 Abb., 354, 356, note.),* As amended, 1862. 776
Form of exception. Levy. Against 7lsband and wife.]-An execution on a judg- ment in an action against husband and wife, jointly, for any debt of the wife contracted before marriage, should direct the officer to enforce the judgment against the separate estate and property of the wife only, and not against that of the husband. (Laws of 1853, ch. 576, Â§ 1.),ART. 5.-Levy. In general.]-The officer tb whom the execution is directed and delivered must proceed to make a levy according to its purport. The officer must hold an execution valid to the extent to which he asserts authority to levy under it. Thus, he cannot levy for a greater amount than the condition of a bond on which judgment has been entered by confession, together with the costs, even if the debtor agrees at the time of confessing judgment, that such a levy may be made (Bergen v. Boerum, 2 Cai. 256); but the levy will be valid to the extent to which the execution is lawfully issued. (Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 459.) The execution under which he levies must also be operative against the property sought to be levied on; thus, a levy on the separate property of one of two joint debtors, under an execution indorsed to be levied against their joint property (Sherry v. Schiuyler, 2 Hill, 204), or a levy upon property wholly belonging to another person than the judgment debtor (Hoyt v. Van Alstyne, 15 Barb. 568), is void. The officer may levy, although he has already levied on property sufficient to satisfy the amount of the judg- ment. (Denvrey v. Fox, 22 Barb. 522.) A levy cannot be made after the return day (Yail v. Lewis, 4 Johns. 450), even on property acquired by the debtor subsequently to the return day (Shelton v. Wester- velt, 1 Duer, 109; Devoe v. Elliott, 2 Cai. 243); but pro- perty substituted before the return day in the place of,98,777
Levy. On real property. On personal property. other property already taken may then be levied on (ib.), although the officer cannot enforce an agreement for such substitution. (Ib.),The levy need not be made at one time-thus, a levy made by two seizures, a week intervening between them, is valid. (Denvrey v. Fox, 22 Barb. 522.),On real property.]-No formal levy (Wood v. Colvin, 5 Hill, 228), or entry in or near real property (Burka7rdt v. llfeCicllan, 15 Abb. 243, note; raggerty v. Wilber, 16 Johns. 287, 289), is necessary. The property is deemed to be in the custody of the law, as soon as the judgment becomes a lien thereon. (Wood v. Colvin, supra.),On personal property.]l-The officer must assume do- minion over personal propertylevied upon, having it at the time within his power and subject to immediate seizure. (Price v. Shipps, 16 Barb. 585.) His mere intent to levy, not divulged, is not sufficient; as, for example, where he merely goes to the house of the debtor with an execution, -without any other manifestation of an intent to levy (Beekeman v. Lansing, 3 Wend. 446), or simply enters the debtor's store, and seeing the goods, subsequently makes a memorandum of the levy (Calp v. Chamnberlain, 5 Den. 198), or merely informs the debtor that he holds an exe- cution against him, even if the goods are in view of the officer at the time ('Westervelt v. Pinenecy, 14 Wend. 123; Randall's Case, 5 City Hall Rec. 141, 160), or makes an indorsement of a levy on the writ, without assuming any dominion over the property. (Price v. Siiipps, 16 Barb. 585.),But such intent manifested in any form (Green v. Burke, 23 Wend. 490, 493), either expressly by word of mouth, without manual prehension of the goods (Barker v. Bin- ninger, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 270), or tacitly, by possessory acts, without any public avowal of an intent to levy (But. ler v. Maynard, 11 Wend 548; see Banlk of Lsansigburgh 778
Levy. On personal property. What force usable. v. Crary, sp. t., 1 Barb. 542), and without removing them (Green v. Burke, 23 Wend. 490; Ray v. Rarcourt, 19 id. 495; Beeenan. v. Lansing, 3 id. 446), or taking an inventory (Greeo v. Burke, supra; Watts v. Cleaveland, 3 E. I). Smith, 553), though the latter is desirable (ib.), is suffi- cient if coupled with the power of immediately enforcing such intent. (Artisans' Bankv. Treadwell, 34 Barb. 553,559; Dresser v. Ainsworth, 9 Barb. 619; Van Wyck v. Pine, 2 Hill, 666; Ray v. Harcourt, 19 Wend. 495; Haggerty v. Wilber, 16 Johns. 287.) A mere proclamation of levy made by an officer holding an execution upon goods locked up, not within view, is not a valid levy (Haggerty v. Wilber, 16 Johns. 287); nor is it sufficient, in order to render the levy actual, and to put the chattels within the officer's power, that all the chattels are upon the premises at the time; they must also be within his view. (Tan Wycik v. Pine, supra.) If the officer takes all the possession of which the chat- tel is susceptible, it will be a sufficient levy. (Whipple v. Foot, 2 Johns. 418.) Thus an oral levy on unripe crops is sufficient. (Ib.; see .Hart1ell v. Bissell, 17 Johns. 128.),Wltat force may be utsed.]-The officer has no right to break the outer door of the debtor's dwelling (People v. Hubbard, 24 Wend. 369), nor even to raise the latch thereof (Curtis v. IHutbbard, 4 Hill, 437; iff'g S. 0., 1 id. 336), whether the debtor is at home or not. (lb.) And if, having thus entered, he makes a levy, the debtor may lawfilly resist him. (People v. Hubbard, supra.),But this privilege does not extend to any out-houses of the debtor, not immediately connected with his dwelling house, and forming part thereof (Haggerty v. Wilber, 16 Johns. 287); nor to an inner door of the dwelling house. (Bttchison v. Birch, 4 Taunt. 619.) And if goods, upon which the officer has levied, are taken by the debtor into his house, the officer may break open even the outer,779
Levy. On personal property. Constructive levy. door, after making a reasonable demand for admittance. (Glover v. Whittenlal , 6 Hill, 597.),It is said, in a book entitled to much respect (1 Butrr. Pr. 296), that the officer may, after demand, break open the house of a third person, in which any of the debtor's goods are found; but this is not law. He may enter such a house if he finds the door open, but not otherwise (see Coolie v. Birt, 5 Taunt. 765); and this at his own risk, in case the debtor has nothing there.,Debtor's acquiescecnce.]-Acquiescence in the levy by the debtor or owner is never essential. (Artisans' Bantk v. Treadwoell, 34 Barb. 553, 559.),Constructive levy.]-A levy may be valid as against the debtor and his personal representatives, although made on chattels not within view of the officer, e. g., by the debtor's agreeing with the officer that his levy on goods within his view shall be considered a levy on other chattels upon the premises, sufficient to satisfy the execu- tion (Mills v. Thursby, sp. t., 11 How. 121); but such con- structive levy is not operative against persons whose rights are to be affected by actual levy only, e. g., other execution creditors whose executions are issued from different courts (Ray v. Harcolrt, 19 Wend. 495), or sub- sequent purchasers, in good faith, from the execution debtor. (Van IVyck v. Pine, 2 Hill, 666; Dresser v. Ains- worth, 9 Barb. 619.),If, after having levied under one execution, another is received by the officer, the first levy is sufficient for both (Cresson v. Stout, 17 Johns. 116; Slade v. Yan Veceten, 11 Paige, 21); and the mere receipt of the latter operates as a levy under it, as against the debtor (Van Winkle v. Udall, 1 Hill, 559), or subsequent mortgagees (Thomlnpson v. Van Vechten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 475), and purchasers from him, subsequent to the levy, with notice of the execution; (Tanh Winkle v. Udall, supra.) So, a levy expressly made 780

Crary, sp. t., 1 Barb. 542.),Receiptor.]-The officer may leave the property levied on, in the hands of a third person, and take his agree- ment to return the same or pay the amount of the execu- tion and the officer's fees. (Burrall v. Acker, 23 Wend. 606; S. 0., 21 id. 605.),A receiptor cannot, under any circumstances, defend himself against the officer on the ground that the levy was excessive. (Dezell v. Odell, 3 Hill, 215.),Effect of levy.]-Property levied on in the possession of the execution debtor, even if the execution is satisfied (Gardner v. Campbell, 15 Johns. 401), is in the custody of the law and cannot be replevied (ib.; Hall v. 'uttle, 2 Wend. 475), unless held by the debtor as a servant or other person whose right to the possession may be de- terminled at any time at the option of some third person (Hall v. Tuttle, supra); nor can it be distrained for taxes against the execution debtor. (FHartwcll v. Bissell, 17 Johns. 128.),The property remains in the custody of the law, although left by the officer in the hands of a third person for safe keeping. (Barker v. Miller, 6 Johns. 195.),If the execution does not authorize the levy, or if the officer disregards the creditor's instructions, the property is not in the custody of the law. (Sherry v. Schuyler, 2 Hill, 204.) The levy gives the execution creditor no right to the property levied on, upon which an action for its con- version can be maintained against any person except the officer (Barker v. Mathew2s, 1 Den. 335; doubted, How-,781
Levy. Effect of. , Stay of execution. land v. Willetts, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 174); at any rate if sufficient property to satisfy the execution is left, not con- verted. (Marsh v. White, 3 Barb. 518.),A levy precludes the execution creditor from alleging, on a motion to set aside the execution, that the judgment debtor has no interest in the property. (Lamibert v. Co1- verse, sp. t., 22 How. 265, 268.),A levy by an officer does not constitute him the owner of the property levied on, so as to entitle him to give an attachment bond. (Pierce v. Kiigsnismill, 25 Barb. 631.),A mere formal levy, it seems, is not such an interfer. ence with the possession of a receiver as to render the officer guilty of a contempt. (Albany City Bank v. Sclher- mnerhorn, 9 Paige, 378; 10 id. 263.),A levy on sufficient property is not, per se, a satisfaction of the judgment. (Denvrey v. Fox, 22 Barb. 522.),A levy on real property does not divest the debtor's estate therein. (Simonds v. Catlin, 8 Johns. 520.),Stay ofexecution.]-Service of an undertaking on appeal stays all further proceedings on an execution which has been levied, but does not discharge the levy. (Smith v. Allen, 2 E. D. Smith, 259; Stricker v. lVakeman, sp. t., 13 Abb. 85.) If, after an execution issued, a copy under- taking on appeal is served on the party, but not on the officer, a levy made by direction of the party- will be set aside as oppressive. (Jones v. M2'Carl, 7 Abb. 418.),Letting in a non-resident to defend does not, of itself, stay proceedings on execution. (Carsiwell v. Yeville, sp. t., 12 How. 445.),Presumptltions.]-The court will presume that property actually levied on was property which the officer had a right to take. (VWALVORTH, Ch., Burrall v. Ackcer, 23Wend. 606, 610.),If a sale has been made by the officer, the presumption is that he levied before the sale. (Smith v. Hill, 22 Barb. 656.) 782
Levy. Â· Proceedings on disputed title. Evidence.]-The officer's indorsement on the execution, to the effect that he has levied, is prima facie evidence of such levy. (Price v. Shipps, 16 Barb. 585; see Millslaugh v. Mitchell, 8 id. 333.),New York city.]-Executions cannot be levied on pro- perty of the corporation of the city of New York, until after ten days' written notice to the comptroller by the party, his agent, or attorney, or by the sheriff. (Laws 1860, ch. 379.),ART. 6.-Proeeedings onl dislputed title. When the officer doubts whether property in the pos- session and under the control of the judglment debtor belongs to him, he should, if the execution creditor does not offer an indemnity, summon a jury to inquire in whom the right to the property is vested (Culrtis v. Patterson, 8 Cow. 65; Platt v. Sherry, 7 Wend. 236; see Magnle v. Seyimour, 5 Wend. 309); and if he returns the execution 1lla bbona, without summoning a jury, he will be liable in an action for filse return, in case the property really does belong to the debtor (ib.); whereas if the jury find that the property belongs to a third person, the officer is not liable to an action, even though the property really belongs to the debtor. (Bayhley v. Bates, 8 Johns. 185.) But the verdict of the jury will not protect the sheriff from an action by a third person, in case he seizes the property, and it proves not to have been owned by the debtor (Townsend v. Phillils, 10 Johns. 98); nor is evidence of the verdict admissible in such an action, even in mitigation of damages. (Glossol) v. Pole, 3 3Mau. & Selw. 175.) If sufficient indemnity is duly offered (Bayley v. Bates, 8 Johns. 185; as explained in Vant Cleef v. Fleet, 15 Johns. 151), the officer should levy and sell without summoning a jury (Van Cleef v. Fleet, 15 Johns. 147; see WVilliams v. Ltowndes, 1 Hall, 579), or notwithstanding the verdict of,783
Proceedings on disputed bills. , Lien of execution. the jury that the debtor does not own the goods (Van Cleef v. Fleet, supra; Curtis v. Patterson, 8 Cow. 67), and if he refuses to do so, the verdict of his jury will not protect him. (Ib.),And he must, in all cases, levy upon goods in posses. sion of the debtor, without waiting for either indemnity or a jury (Williams v. Lowudes, 1 Hall, 579); though he may properly refuse to proceed any further without the one or tle other, in case of an adveise claim of title.,If necessary for the sheriff's protection, the court will extend the time for uaking his return (see Willians v. Lowlndes, supra; Bayley v. Bates, 8 Johns. 185), or compel the conflicting claimants to litigate their claims (ib.; see Canmp v. Chamberlain, 5 Den. 203), but the officer cannot bring an action of interpleader in order to test the right. (Shaw v. Coster, 8 I'aige, 339.),Whether he can have relief under Â§ 122 of the Code, in case an action is brought against him, is at least doubtful. The English statute, from which Â§ 122 was substantially copied, expressly extends its benefit to sheriffs, but the Code does not; and it has not yet been determined whether it does so by implication.,ART. 7.-Lien of execution. The lien of an execution commences, as to personal property, at the time of the delivery of the writ to be executed. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 644; [2 id. 365]; Thompsonl v. Van Veclhten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 471.) Before delivery it does not bind the goods (3 R. S.. supra; Hendricks v. Robinson, 2 Johns. Ch. 283, 312; Beals v. Guetrnsey, 8 Johns. 446; see Ray v. Birdseye, 5 Den. 625), nor author- ize the sheriff to sue for their conversion. (Hotch7kiss v. McVickar, 12 Johns. 403; Marsh v. Lawrence, 4 Cow. 461.),The sheriff's fees are not a lien on the land. (Bank of Whitehall v. IWeed, sp. t., 8 How. 104, 109.) 78 '
Lien of execution. Purchascr. Extent of lien. Exception in favor of purchasers.l]-As against purchas- ers in good faith from the debtor the execution creates no lien until actual levy. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366]; Ray v. Birdseye, 5 Den. 619; CaLmp v. Chamlberlain, 5 id. 198.) A person to whom the goods are mortgaged (Warner v. Paine, 3 Barb. Ch. It. 360), or assigned to secure his own debt (Ray v. Birdseye, snpra), or assigned to sell for the benefit of creditors generally (Slade v. V-an Ve'ten, 11 Paige, 21), is not a purchaser in good faith within the statute. Nor is one who has notice that the execution has been issued. (Ray v. Birdseye, supra.),The terms "actual levy," used in the statute, mean such a levy as is required before the property can be sold. (B1tler v. Mlaynard, 11 Wend. 548, 551.),An actual levy will not be presumed, as against a pur- chaser in good faith and for value, in order to defeat a title obtained before the return day and soon after deliv- ery to the officer. (Millspattu v. Mitchell, 8 Barb. 333.),Extent of lien.]-The lien extends to property actually levied on either expressly (Thompson v. Van Vechten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 471), or by implication (ib. 475); and, in the latter case, even if the execution first levied becomes dormant, the lien of the other execution still continues as against the debtor (Peck v. Tiffanty, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 451; Richards v. Allen, 3 E. D. Smith, 399), or his subse- quent mortgagees (Tholmpson, v. Van Vecliten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 479), or his creditors, whose executions are subsequently delivered (Peck v. Tiffany, supra); and as to the latter, notwithstanding the execution first levied is subsequently withdrawn (Van Winkle v. Udall, 1 Hill, 559); but not if the prior levy was originally invalid. (See Bank of Lansingburgh v. Crary, sp. t., 1 Barb. 542.) An execution is not a lien upon an interest which can- not be sold under it (Henldricks v. Robinson, 2 Jolns. Oh. 283, 312), as, for example, an equitable right to redeem,99,785
Lien of execution. Dormant levy. (ib.); nor on property acquired (Shelton v. Westervelt, 1 Duer, 109) or levied on after the return day. (Slinigerland v. Suwart, 13 Johns. 255.),Dormant levy.]-If the officer suffers personal property to remain in the execution debtor's possession, by the creditor's direction, for the purpose of delay, the lien of the execution will be postponed to that of an execution subsequently delivered (Dudlderdale v. Sanvrestre, 13 Abb. 116; Kimball v. Allwger, 2 Hill, 364; Beiljamlin v. Smith, 4 Wend. 332; Rewn v. Barber, 3 Cow. 272, 279; Kellogg v. Griffen, 17 Johns. 274; Storm v.Woods, 11 Johns. 110), and to the title of a subsequent purchaser in good faith. (Ball v. Shell, 21 Wend. 222; Hiceook v. Coates, 2 id. 419.),Directing the sheriff not to allow the execution to lose its preference (Kellogg v. Griffen, supra), or the absence of any intent to defraud, on the part of the creditor (Ificeook v. Coates, supra), will not prevent this effect.,If the creditor merely permits the property to remain in the debtor's possession, and doe: not direct delay, the execution will not be rendered dormant. (Tlhonmson v. Van Vechten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 479; Herlkirer Co. Banik v. Brown, 2 Hill, 232; Ferguson v. Lee, 9 Wend. 258; .Russell v. Gibbs, 5 Cow. 390; Doty v. Turner, 8 Johns. 20.),Omitting to give notoriety to the levy at the time of making it, does not, of itself, render the execution dor- mant (Butler v. Maynard, 11 Wend. 548); nor does leav- ing the property in the debtor's possession for a reason- able time, without any fraudulent purpose, have that effect (Ib.), especially when the property consists of pon- derous articles. (Farrington v. Sinclair, 15 Johns. 428.),So if the delay is caused in order to prevent a sacrifice of the property, it will not render the execution dormant. (Power v. Fan Buren, 7 Cow. 560.) Thus, a levy in the fall on hides in vats, which could not be taken from the vats until spring, without sacrificing most of the labor already bestowed upon them, together with the bark used in tan- 786
Lien of execution. Priority of executions. ning them, may remain dormant until the following spring without prejudice to the lien of the execution. (Ib.),If the creditor permits the debtor to consume the pro- perty, this will render the execution fraudulent, although no actual fraud is proved. (Farrington v. Sinclair, .15 Johns. 428.),The objection that the execution has become dormant can be made only by another creditor, or by a bona fide purchaser (Ferguson v. Lee, 9 Wend. 258); it cannot be made by the debtor. (Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 456.) The dormancy of an execution does not affect the lien of the judgment upon real property. (Muir v. Leitclh, 7 Barb. 341.),Termination of lien.l]-The lien of an execution termi- nates, as to goods not levied on, at the date of its return. (Watrous v. Lathrop, 4 Sands. 700.) The lien is not extinguished by a release of the pro- perty levied on, made by the officer without the creditor's assent. (Shelton v. Westervelt, 1 Duer, 109.),LAT. 8.-Priority of executions. If several executions, issued out of a court of record against the same debtor, are delivered to the officer to be executed, the execution first delivered has priority, not- withstanding a levy is first made under another (3 R. S. (oth ed.) 645; [2 id. 366]); whether an actual levy is made under the execution first delivered, before a sale under the other execution (Russell v. Gibbs, 5 Cow. 390; Rowe v. Ricliardson, 5 Barb. 385; see Camp v. Chamberlain, 5 Den. 198), or not (Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst ] 451, 457; Lambert v. Paulding, 18 Johns. 311); and although the goods are sold under the subsequent execution only. (Russell v. Gibbs, supra; Rowe v. Riclardson, supra.) If goods are sold under another execution, before actual levy under the execution first delivered, the purchaser's,787
Priority of executions. In general. Partnership property. title cannot be defeated by a levy and sale under the latter. (Marsh v. Lawrence, 4 Cow. 461; 3 B. S. (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366].),When a sale is made by an officer holding several exe- cutions, he must apply the bid on the parcel first sold, in satisfaction of the execution having the first lien. (Barker v. Gates, sp. t., 1 How. 77.),The execution first delivered takes no priority as to proceeds of a levy made after its return day. (Slingerland v. Swart, 13 Johns. 450.),The death of the sheriff, and the appointment of his under-sheriff in his place, will not affect the priority of executions, some of which were delivered before and some after his decease. (Ward v. Storey, 18 Johns. 120.),As against real property, an execution takes priority from the time of docketing the judgment, although issued before the judgment is docketed. (Stoltenlbergh v. Vtandelburqg, sp. t., 7 How. 229, 233.),Issuing execution on a judgment before its lien expires does not extend the lien of the judgment, so as to entitle the execution creditor to a priority as to the avails of real property sold under that and another execution, after the ten years have expired, but before the expiration of the lien of the judgment under which the other execution was issued. (Roe v. Stwart, 5 Cow. 294.),Against partnership property.]-An execution against a firm has, so far as the partnership property is concerned, priority over an execution against a member of the firm, although the latter is first delivered. (Crane v. French, 1 Wend. 311; Dtlmham v. Murdock, 2 id. 553.) If a levy is made on partnership property, under an execution against a partner, and afterwards an execution against the fin is received, the officer should first sell under the latter (Dunla7t v. Murdocc, supra); and if there is no surplus, he may return the former nulla bo~n. (Ib.),A levy on property belonging to an insolvent limited 788

Loss of priority. partnership, upon an execution issued on a judgment recovered otherwise than on confession, takes priority over a subsequent seizure by a receiver subsequently ap- pointed in an action commenced before the levy. (Van Alstyne v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489.) Executions and attachcmecnts.]-An execution delivered before an attaclunent, takes priority to the attachment, although a levy is first made under the attachment. (3 B. 8 (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366]; Wells v. Marshall, 4 Cow. 411.) An execution against joint debtors has priority over an attachment against one of them, although the attach- ment is for a claim against all. (Abels v. Westervelt, 15 Abb. 230.),An execution or attachment issued out of a court not of record, if actually levied, has preference over any other execution, issued out of any court, and not pre- viously levied. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366].) Loss of priority.]-If the plaintiff in the execution first delivered renders it dormant, its priority is lost (Klnower v. Barnard, 5 Hill, 377; Barstow v. Thorne, sp. t., 2 How. 64; see Peck v. Tiffany, supra); thus, when the officer is ordered by the plaintiff, after levy, not to sell, and after- wards, on the same day on which the officer receives another execution, the receipt of which is known to the plaintiff's attorney, is instructed by the plaintiff to pro- ceed, the priority of the execution is forfeited (Knower v. Barnard, supra); but merely consenting that a sale may be adjourned, will not produce this effect. (Paton v. W es- tervelt, 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 7.) Alteration.]-Correcting an immaterial variance, with the defendant's consent, will not affect the priority of the execution. (Oakley v. Becker, 2 Cow. 454.),789

(5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369].),'ime of sale.]-A sale under execution must be made between 9 A. M. and sundown. (3 1-. S. (5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369].) If made after sunset it is void. (Carnrick v. Meyers, 14 Barb. 9.),The officer should use a reasonable discretion as to time, place and manner of sale. (M'Donald v. Neilson, 2.Cow. 139, 170, 190; Tinlkom v. Purdy, 5 Johns. 345.) It is his duty to postpone the sale if that will prevent a sacrifice of the defendant's property (M'Donald v. Neilsoil, supra), especially when the officer cannot possibly suffer loss thereby. (Ib.),If the execution of the writ has been commenced before the return day, it may be completed afterwards, without issuing a new writ. (Wood v. Colvin, 5 Hill, 228.,Mere delay in selling property levied on, does not Tender the sale void in respect to an execution issued .after the sale. (Linnendolt v. Doe, 14 Johns. 222.),Place.J-If personal property levied on is left in the debtor's possession by the officer, he may sell it on the debt- or's land, and third persons may attend there as bidders. (See People v. Hopson, 1 Den. 575, 580; approved, Stif v. Hart, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 37.),Irregular and void sales.]-A sale by an officer when he has no authority to sell, vests no title in the purchaser. (Carter v. Simpson, 7 Johns. 535; see Van Antwerp v. Newnwan, 2 Cow. 546.; So if he does not comply with the requirements of the statute as to having the property within view, or selling real and personal property in different lots. (.Breese v.

Colkin, 2 Hill, 566) or with- out entry of satisfaction (Jackson v. Cadwell, 1 Cow. 622), or by the officer's paying the amount of the judgment (Carpenter v. Stilwell, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 71; Sherman v. Boyce, 15 Johns. 443; see Reed v. Pruyn, 7 id. 426), even if he declares, at the time .of payment, that he intends to keep up the judgment conditionally for his own se- curity (Sherman v. Boyce, supra), or where the debtor has duly tendered the amount of the judgment and fees (Mason v. Sudanl, 2 Johns. Oh. 172), the officer's power is at an end; and the sale is void, not only as against a purchaser at such sale, with notice, and in favor of the debtor (Jackson v. Cadvel,, supra), or a subsequent pur- chaser from him (Wood v. Colvin, supra), but also as against a purchaser without notice. (See ib.; Craft v. Merrill, supra; Carpenter v. Stilwell, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 71, 76; Neilson v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 569.),The mere fact that the officer's fees have not been paid, will not authorize the officer to sell therefor (Craft v. Merrill, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 456; Jackson v. Aiincson, 4 Wend. 474, 470; Bank of Whitehall v. Teced, sp. t., 8 How. 104), and a sale therefor is void. (Jackson v. Anderson, supra; Craft v. lMerrill, supra.),A sale of property belonging to two persons, as the property of one of them, it seems is not a trespass on the part of the officer (Fiero v. Betts, 2 Barb. 633), nor is the purchaser of the share of such co-owner a trespasser in taking possession. (Ib.) If the officer has several executions in his hands upon judgments docketed at different times, and has raised money enough to satisfy the oldest judgment, he should sell the residue of the land upon the junior judgments only, so as not to interfere with the rights of those whose property is not affected by the lien of the junior judg- ments; if he fails to do so, he is responsible to the parties,791
Sale. Irregular sales. Who may bid. aggrieved, and the sale will be set aside as irregular, (WALWORTH, Ch., Jackson v. Roberts, 11 Wend. 428.),A sale under a junior judgment is not a waiver of the lien of a senior judgment (Shotwell v. Muitrray, 1 Johns. Ch. 512), although the owner of both judgments attends the sale, and does not disclose his right to the senior judgment. (lb.),Mere inadequacy of price, not accompanied by any collateral suspicious circumstances, is not sufficient to impeach the validity of a sale on execution. (Hildreth v. Sands, 2 Johns. Ch. 35, 50; Kellogg v. Wood, 4 Paige, 578, 589.),Who ;may bid.]-Tlhe officer to whom the execution is directed, or his deputy, conducting the sale, cannot pur- chase any property at the sale, directly or indirectly; and pur'chases made by such persons, or to their use, are void. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370].),A similar statute was held not to prevent a deputy from being a purchaser at a sale under a judgment which had been assigned to himself, the sale being made by another deputy. (Jatc7sonb v. Collins, 3 Cow. 89.) An under jailer or turnkey is not a deputy of the officer. (Jackson v. Anderson, 4 Wend. 474, 481.),One who has agreed to sell the property of another on execution, upon a confession of judgment to him, and out of the proceeds of the sale to pay the debtors of the party confessing, and account to the latter for the remain- der, may himself become the purchaser at the sale under the execution. (Sheldon v. Sheldon, 13 Johns. 220.),It seems that the attorney who issues an execution cannot become a purchaser under it for his own benefit (Howell v. Bar7er, 4 Johns. Oh. 118), without the consent of the execution creditor. (Hawley v. Cramer, 4 Cow. 717, 733.),Property belonging to several persons may be par- 792
Sale. Of personal property. How made. chased by one of them on a sale under an execution against all of them. (Neilson v. v. ilson, 5 Barb. 565.),Staying sale.]-A sale on execution will be stayed on the motion of a purchaser of real property for value and without notice, after a levy on sufficient personal property has been voluntarily relinquished by the execution credi- tor. (Wood v. Torrcy, 6 Wend. 564; Voorh7ees v. Gros, sp. t., 3 How. 262.),ART. 10.-Sale of personal property. Nrotiee.]-Personal property cannot be sold, unless pre- vious notice of the sale is given six days, successively, by fastening written or printed notices thereof, in three pub- lic places of the town where such sale is to be had, speci- fying the time and place of the intended sale. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366].),The omission of the officer to give such notice, or the taking down or defacing of the notice when put, does not, however, affect a purchaser in good faith and without notice. (Id. 651; [2 id. 369].) Separate sale.]-Personal property must be sold sepa- rately from real (Cresson v. Stout, 17 Johns. 116; Breese v. Bange, 2 E. D. Smith, 474), e. g., the machinery in a sac- tory must not be sold with the factory itself, in one lot. (Cresson v. Stout, supra.),Parcels.]-Personal property must be offered for sale in such lots and parcels as are calculated to bring the high- est price. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 648; [2 id. 367].),Personal property mortgaged should be sold in one parcel, since otherwise the purchaser would not acquire the right to redeem. (Tifft v. Barton, 4 Den. 173.) A sale of numerous articles in one lot at the request of the debtor (Stepthens v. Baird, 9 Cow. 274), or of the parties interested (Bruce v.Westervelt, 2 E. D. Smith, 440), is valid.,100,793
Sale of personal property. View. DescriptionS- One who is not a creditor cannot object that a sale is void because made in one lot at the debtor's request (Stephens v. Baird, supra.),An agent of the creditor, appointed for the purpose of bidding at the sale, is not thereby authorized to waive this objection. (Wynman v. Hart, 12 How. 122.),Must be in view.]-Personal property must be present in view of those attending the sale. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 648; [2 id. 367]; Bakewell v. Ellsworth, 1 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 346; Cresson v. Stout, 17 Johns. 116.) But a sale of stereotype plates, by producing impressions of the plates only, this being the usual mode of sale, is valid. (Bruce v. Wester- velt, 2 E. D. Smith, 440.),It seems that the right of redemption in numerous articles, which cannot be gathered so as to be brought into view at one time without incurring great expense, may be sold in view of a part of them, after declaring what is to be sold, and pointing out those articles to the persons attending. (Tifft v. Barton., 4 Den. 171.),If personal property is sold, a pati of which is not pre- sent at the place of sale, the sale is void as to such part only. (Linnendoll v. Doe, 14 Johns. 222.),General descriltion.]-If the officer sells by reference to a general description, e. g., "the thirteen best and fattest of a flock of sheep," without individually identifying those sold, the sale is void. (Warring v. Loomis, 4 Barb. 484.) So if, intending to sell all the debtor's personal property, he puts up some articles specifically, and all the other personal property generally, no title passes. (Shel- don v. Soper, 14 Johns. 352.),Absolute sale of limited interest.]--A sale absolute in its terms, on an execution against a lessee of personal pro- perty, does not divest the lessor's interest. (Vas Antwerp v. Newinan, 2 Cow. 543.) 794
Sale of personal property. Delivery and removal. Real property. Delivery.]-When the goods are bought by the execu- tion creditor, the officer may deliver them to him without receiving the money (Nichols v. Ketcham, 19 Johns. 84); but he ought not to do so in any other case.,If the officer sells and delivers personal property to one of several execution creditors, he cannot recover the amount of the bid, if the creditor is entitled to its amount as a prior execution creditor. (Russell v. Gibbs, 5 Cow. 390.),Removal.]-The purchaser may remove the goods, with- out waiting for the officer to makle out a formal bill of sale. (Gilbert v. Mfoody, 17 Wend. 354.) The removal must not be delayed beyond a sufficient time for that purpose. (Ib.) Three days were held to be an unreasonable time to leave household furniture upon the debtor's premises, when it might have been removed in one day. (Ib.),The goods cease to be in the custody of the law, as soon as a reasonable time for their removal has elapsed. (Ib.),If the omission to remove the goods is founded upon a sufficient excuse, e. g., that they are not in a fit state for delivery, the sale will not be void. (Woovdwortl v. Wood- worth, 21 Barb. 343.),Effect.]-A regular sale of personal property transfers to the purchaser the title of the debtor as it existed on the day of the delivery of the writ, unless the lien is subse- quently defeated. (TlhompA)soin v. Va Ycech7ten, sp. t., 5 Abb. 458, 471; Fuller v. Allen, sp. t., 7 id. 12; 16 How. 247.),Fraludulent sale.]-When a sale of personal property at a great sacrifice is effected under an execution by parties cognizant of the interest of a third person therein, for the purpose of defeating his interest, it will be deemed fraudu- lent as against him. (Crary v. Sprague, 12 Wend. 41.),ART. 11.-Sale of real property. Notice.]-The time and place of sale must be publicly advertised, previously, for six weeks successively, as follows:,795
Sale of real property. Notice. 1. A written or printed notice thereof must be fastened up in three public places in the town where the property is to be sold, and if the sale is in a town different from that in which the premises are situated, then in three public places in the town in which they are situated, also;,2. A copy of the notice must be printed once in each week in a newspaper of the county, if there is one;,3. If there is none, and the premises are not occupied by any person against whom the execution is issued, or by some person holding the same as tenant or purchaser under such person, then the notice must be published in the state paper, once in each week. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 368].),The notice must describe the property with common certainty, by setting forth the name of the township or tract, and the number of the lot, if any, and if there is none, by some other appropriate description. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369].),The publication need not commence six weeks pre- vious to the day of sale. (Olcott v. Robinson, 21 N. Y. 150; rev'g S. 0., 20 Barb. 148.) Thus, if the notice is first pub- lished only thirty-nine days previous to the day of sale, it will be sufficient if it is inserted six times, once in each of six successive weeks. (lb.),A publication of the notice in an extra is not a publica- tion in a newspaper, within the meaning of the statute. (O1cott v. Robinson, 20 Barb. 148.),The debtor must pay the expenses incurred in contin- uing the advertisement, after an order for a stay of execu- tion until the decision of a non-enumerated motion, if the motion is denied (Smith v. Martin, 18 Wend. 590); but not if the order to stay is made for the purpose of enab- ling him to move for a new trial on a case. (Ib.),The execution under which the sale is made need not be described in the advertisement. It is sufficient if the advertisement states that the sale is to be pursuant to an execution. (See HiTsted v. Dacin, 17 Abb. 137, 151.) 796
Sale of real property. Notice. Parcels. If the officer advertises to sell on one execution only, he cannot sell on that and another execution subsequently delivered. (Mascraft v. tan Antlwepr, 3 Cow. 334.),A sale on execution converts the general lien of the judgment into a specific lien on the real property sold, to the extent of the amount bid and interest thereon. (Sny- der v. Stafford, 11 Paige, 71, 77.),Parcels.]-W\ heu the real property offered for sale con- sists of several known lots, tracts or parcels, they must be separately exposed for sale. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369] ; see sewsont v. Deygert, 8 Johns. 333; Jackson v. Nrew- comb, 18 id. 355; Woods v. Morrell, 1 Johns. Ch. 502; Tier- nan v. Wilson, 6 id. 411; o7htoaw1k Bank v. Atwater, 2 Paige, 54.),A tract, occupied as one farm by one of several judg- mlent debtors, is not deemed to consist of several parcels, merely because his co-defendants have estates in remain- der in other portions of it. (dNelson v. ANcilson, 5 Barb. 565.) When the tract sold is small, e. g., three acres, and in the possession of one tenant only, it will not be presumed that it was divided into lots. (Woods v. Aborrell, 1 Johns. CIh. 502.) If any person claiming to be the owner of any portion of such property, or entitled to redeem any such portion, requires it to be exposed for sale separately, it is the offi- cer's duty to do so. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369].) If no objection is made, it seems the officer may sell, at once, all the interests of several defendants. (Nreilson v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 565, 571.),If parcels are sold in one lot, contrary to the statute, the provision being merely directory, the sale is voidable only (Ctnnin7gham, v. Cassidy, 17 N. Y. 276; 7 Abb. 183; Gross v. Jones, 6 Wend. 522; see Mohawk Bank v. Atwater, supra; Husted v. Dakin, 17 Abb. 137), and will not be set aside, if the party aggrieved acquiesces therein for an,797
Sale of real property. Excessive sales. Resale. unreasonable length of time. (Cunninigham v. Cassidy; Gross v. Jones, supra; Jackson v. Newvtonl, 18 Johns. 355, 362.),Excessive sales.]-The officer must not expose more of the debtor's real property for sale, than appears to be necessary to satisfy the execution. (3 R. S. (51/h ed.) 650; [2 id. 369]; Tiernan v. WIilson, 6 Johns. Oh. 411, 414; Gross v. Jones, 6 Wend. 522; see Troup v. Wood, 4 Johns. Ch. 228.),This provision is directory only, and a violation of it does not usually affect the purchaser's title (Gross v. Jones, supra); but where the sale is made in bad faith, e. g., where real property worth $10,000 is sold to satisfya judgment for S100, and the property is so situated that a portion of it could have been sold separately for more than enough to satisfy that judgment, the sale will be set aside. (Ib.),Penalty.]-If the officer sells real property without the statutory notice, or otherwise than as directed by the statute, he forfeits $1,000 to the party injured, in addition to any damages sustained by him. (3 R. l . (th ed.) 650; [2 id. 369]; see Wright v. Hooker, 4 Cow. 415.),.ART. 12.-Resale. When real property sold on execution, and bid in by a third person for less than the amount of the judgment, is subsequently redeemed by the debtor, it may be resold on the same execution for the balance remaining due. (Wood v. Colvin, 5 Hill, 228.),Setting aside sale for irregularity, &c.]-If several lots are sold in one mass, the sale will be set aside, on motion of the judgment creditor (Ames v. Locktwood, sp. t., 13 How. 555), or of any other party aggrieved.,A sale of lands on execution, after an arrangement by which the judgment is equitably satisfied, if made to a 798
Resale. Setting aside sale. person having notice, will be set aside as fraudulent. (fasonl v. Sltam, 2 Johns. Oh. 172.) If the execution might have been satisfied out of other property than the land sold under it, the sale will be set aside in favor of another bona fide purchaser of the land so sold, when the purchaser at the sheriff's sale is the assignee of the judg- ment under which it was made. (Welch v. James, sp. t., 22 How. 474.),A sale of the life estate of a tenant by the curtesy initiate, who has executed articles of settlement, will be set aside in favor of his wife, although no conveyance has been executed. (Tisdale v. Jones, 38 Barb. 328.),Setting aside sale for fatror.]-Wheln, on a sale of real property under execution, the plaintiff inadvertently bids a sun less than the amount of his execution, a resale will be ordered on his stipulating to bid at least the sum already bid by him over the amount of prior incum- brances. (Ontario Bankt v. Lansing, 2 Wend. 26O.),The plaintiff's agent having, by mistake, omitted to attend the sale, property worth $1,000 was bid off by a relative of the defendants for $26. The defendant being insolvent, a resale was ordered. (Bixly v. ltead, 18 Wend. 611.) But if the plaintiff's agent, by mistake, bids less than the amount directed, a resale will not be ordered on motion, as against parties having a right to redeem. (Yan(lenlurglb v. Briggs, 7 Cow. 367.) If, by reason of the debtor's misrepresentations as to the situation of the land sold, the plaintiff is deceived, and bids it in at a much larger price than its real value, the sale will be set aside, and a resale ordered. (Muilks v. Allen, 12 Wend. 253.) Where the judgment creditor was prevented from attending, by the deputy's promising to give him notice of the sale, and the property was sacri- siced by his failure to do so, the sale was set aside. (Ames v. Lockwood, sp. t., 13 How. 555.) The court will relieve a purchaser, who was induced to purchase by a misrepre-,799

(Dwight's Case, 15 Abb. 259.),A sale made under an advertisement which is incorrect by mistake, will be set aside on payment of costs of motion, and of the costs incurred by a purchaser in an action for the penalty given in case of the sheriff's failure to advertise. (Wright v. Hooker, 4 Cow. 415.),ART. 13.-Title and rights of the purchaser. Title to personal )prol)erty.]-The purchaser of personal property at an execution sale, has a right to its imme- diate possession, upon paying the price, and acquires an absolute title thereto.,Title to real prol)erty.]-A sale of real property, under an execution, does not divest the debtor's estate until the purchase-money is paid (Farmers' Bank v. Merchant, sp. t., 13 How. 10; Catlin v. Jaclson, 8 Johns. 550), and the deed delivered (Ib.; Smith v. Colvin, 17 Barb. 157), and the time for redemption expires. (3 R. S. (t7h ed.) 655; [2 id. 373]; Rich v. Baker, 3 Den. 79.),Until then, the purchaser acquires no legal estate, but only a lien. (Smith v. Colvin, supra; Taughn v. Ely, sp, t., 4 Barb. 159; Farmers' Bankt v. Mlerchant, supra.),After the purchaser has acquired' title, he is deemed vested with the estate from the time of the sale, for the purpose of bringing an action for any injury to the pro- perty (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 655; [2 id. 373]; Rich v. Baker, supra); and the debtor, and any person holding under him, is answerable to the purchaser for any waste he may have committed after the sale. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 622; [2 id. 336]; T7iomas v. Crofut, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 474; Rich v. Baker, supra.),Judgment debtor, &c., holding over..]-After delivery of the officer's deed, if the debtor remains in possession, he becomes, in effect, a tenant at will to the purchaser. (Jacdk 800
Title of purchaser. Debtor holding over. son v. Sternbergh, 1 Johns. Cas. 153; JTackson v. Graham, 3 Cai. 188; see Jackcson v. Scott, 18 Johns. 94.) In such cases, the presumption as between the purchaser and third persons is that the debtor remains in possession as tenant to the purchaser, and in subordination to his title. (Russell v. Doty, 4 Cow. 576.) Persons entering into possession under the judgment debtor, after execution issued, must yield up the posses- sion to tle purchaser, unless they can show a better right in themselves, or that the judgment was invalid as against them (Bank of Utica v. Mersereau, 3 Barb. Ch. R. 528, 571), or that the defendant's title could not be sold on execution. (Colvin v. Baker, 2 Barb. 206.),A person who takes possession under the judgment debtor, before delivery of the deed, becomes a quasi tenant at will of the purchaser when the deed is delivered (Colvin v. Baker, supra), and is estopped fiom denying that the purchaser acquired such title as was owned by the debtor at the time of the sale (ib.), but not from al- leging that the debtor's interest was not liable to be sold on execution (ib.; Bigelow v. Finch, 11 Barb. 498; see Dickinson v. Smnith, 25 id. 102), e. g., that it was a mere estate at will or at sufferance (Colvin v. Baker, supra; Bigelow v. Finch, supra), or had previously expired (see Bigelow v. Finch, 17 Barb. 394; Dickinson v. Smith, 25 id. 102), e. g., that it was an estate for years which had terminated before delivery of the deed. (Ib.) The defendant in the execution may defend against the purchaser's action for recovery of possession, by showing that his interest was not liable to be sold on execution. (Bigelow v. Finch, 11 Barb. 500; Griffln v. Sipencer, 6 Hill, 525.) Whlat passes to the purchaser.]-The purchaser acquires all the title of the judgment debtor to the premises (Sweet v. Green, 1 Paige, 473), including covenants of warranty (Sweet v. Green, supra; Kellogg v. Wood, 4,101,801
Title of purchaser. What passes. Incumbrance. Paige, 578, 614), and equitable claims to be relieved from incumnbrances. (Kellogg v. Wood, 4 Paige, 578, 615.),He is entitled to .every advantage which the judgment creditor would have had, had he been the purchaser (Hildreth v. Samls, 2 Johns. Ch. 35, 50; 14 Johns. 493; Wood v. Jackson, 8 Wend. 9, 36), but not to the benefit of a collateral fact settled by the verdict, if the verdict is afterwards set aside. (Wood v. Jatckson, supra.),He takes the land subject to any equitable claim there, to prior in time to the judgment, and of which he has notice before actual payment. (Sandford v. McLean, 3 Paige, 117, 123; Bartlett v. Gale, 4 id. 503, 508; Aerill v. Lodcks, sp. t., 6 Barb. 19.) Thus, land owned by one partner, which has been improved by the firm, does not pass to a purchaser at an execution sale against the part- ner, discharged from the equitable title of the firm, if the purchaser has notice thereof before paying the purchase- money. (Averill v. Loucks, supra.),A purchaser takes no greater interest than the officer can rightfully sell, and has no claim to be indemnified by him. (Ball v. Pratt, 36 Barb. 402.),Incumlbrances.]-Ak sale and conveyance under it after the time to redeem has expired, destroys the lien of all junior judgments. (Ex parte Stevens, 4 Cow. 123.),The title of a judgment creditor who purchases land which is subject to an equitable mortgage for the pur. chase-money, on a sale under his judgment, is post- poned to that of the mortgagee. (Chase v. Pec7i, 21 N. Y. 581.),When, before the Revised Statutes, the purchaser at a sale under a judgment on a bond given to secure a mort- gage knew that the mortgage remained unsatisfied, and paid much less than the value of the land, he was con- sidered as having purchased the right of redemption only. (Jackson v. Hull, 10 Johns. 481.) 802
Titlo of purchaser. Effect of irregularities. Title, how affected by irregularities.]-The purchaser's title is not affected by irregularities in the judgment, e. g., by the entry of a general judgment, when it should have run against the defendants in their representative capacity (Jackson v. Rosevelt, 13 Johns. 97); nor by a defect in the judgments on which a part of the executions issued, under which a sale was had (Bruce v. Vfesterrelt, 2 E. D. Smith, 440); nor by a subsequent reversal of the judgment for error (see Woodcock v. Bennett, 1 Cow. 711); nor by a mere irregularity in the execution, e. g., by an omisrlon to levy until after the return day (Jackson v. Bartlett, 8 Johns. 361; Jackson v. Rosevelt, 13 id. 97), or to revive the action, when the parties remain unchanged (.ackson v. Bartlett, supra; Jackson v. Rosevelt, supra; JacksoJn v. Delancey, 13 Johns. 535, 550; Woodcock v. Bennett, 1 Cow. 711; Averill v. Wilson, 4 Barb. 180); nor by an incorrect return (Jackson v. Sternbergh, 1 Johns. Cas. 153); nor by the sheriff's omission to file the certifi- cate of sale. (Jaceksoin v. Young, 5 Cow. 269.),The title of a purchaser for a sum less than the amount due on a judgment is valid, although the execution is issued for a greater amount than was actually due, by reason of a failure to credit a payment on the judgment. (Peet v. Cowenhoven, sp. t., 14 Abb. 56.) The regularity of an execution cannot be questioned by a person holding under the execution debtor, in an action brought against him by the purchaser to recover possession of the premises. (Jackson v. Bartlett, supra.) A title obtained under a sale on several executions is valid, although some of them were dormant. (Richards v. Allen, 3 E. D. Smith, 399.) If the debtor causes a fraud to be committed in con- ducting the sale, the purchaser's title is not affected by it, unless he participates therein. (1Wy mans v. Hart, 12 How. 122.),Void execution.]-If the execution is not irregular, merely, but void, e. g., because issued against the real,803
Title of purchaser. Under void execution. property of one of the defendants after his death, without revival a sale under it is void, though had before it is set aside. (Woodcock v. Bennett, 1 Cow. 711.),So if the judgment is satisfied before the sale (Craft v. ierrill, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 427; Wood v. Colvin, 2 Hill, 566); and an assignee of the sheriffs certificate takes no title by obtaining a deed from the sheriff, on a sale to a purchaser, with notice that the judgment under which the sale was made was satisfied, although the assignee has no notice thereof. (Wood v. Colvin, supra; approved, NTeilson v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 565, 569; Stafford v. WFilson, 12 id. 240.),A purchaser of personal property, at a sale on execu- tion against a third person, acquires no title as against the true owner in possession, although his purchase was made in good faith. (Chambers v. Lelvis, 16 Abb. 433.) If the property of one person is sold on an execution against another, the purchaser takes no title as against the owner. (Farnham v. Hildreth, 32 Barb. 277.),Title taken after redemption, with notice.]-The assignee of a sheriff's certificate, who takes a deed from the sheriff after a redemption from the sale under which the deed is given, with notice that the redemption has been made, acquires no title as against a purchaser under a junior judgment. (Stafford v. Williams, 12 Barb. 240.),Where a sale is made under two executions, if the sale, so far as it was made under one of them, is set aside, this does not affect the title obtained under the other. (See Bay v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 220.),Acts of third persons.]-The purchaser's title is not affected by transactions after the sale between third parties. (Jackson v. Bartlett, 8 Johns. 361.),Putrchase by attorney.]-A purchase by one of the attor- neys who issued the execution, for a grossly inadequate price, e. g., of a farm worth $2,000, for $10, will be held 804
Title of purchaser. Certificato of sale. to have been made for the debtor's benefit. (Howell v. Baker, 4 Johns. Oh. 118.),When the attorney by whom the execution was issued purchases under it, he is chargeable with notice of every irregularity attending it. (Sinonds v. Catlin, 2 Cai. 61; Cole. & C. Cas. 346.),Talcing possession.]-A purchaser of real property under an execution, may enter and take possession in a peace- able manner, although some personal property of the debtor is left on the premises, and although they may be occasionally occupied by his servants (MlcDouga!l v. Sitcher, 1 Johns. 42); but he cannot take possession if the premises are occupied (People v. relson, 13 Johns. 340; see Russell v. Doty, 4 Cow. 579), and the sheriff has no right to deliver actual possession to him. (People v. Nelson, supra.),Title as against prior execution not levied.]-The title of a purchaser in good faith of goods, acquired prior to the actual levy of an execution, and without notice of its being issued, is not divested by the fact that such execu- tion was delivered before his purchase was made. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 645; [2 id. 366].),Waiver.]-The purchaser may waive his title under the certificate, when the rights of third parties are not in question. (Wright v. Douglass, 3 Barb. 554, 569.) A judgment creditor who has received properl y from his debtor as security only, and afterwards issues execu- tion and buys the property himself, waives his title under the sale by an agreement to hold the property under the former trust, without any new consideration. (Delanater v. Ryder, 11 Johns. 533.),ART. 14.-Certificate of sale. Every purchaser of real property, at a sale under exe- cution, is entitled to a certificate of sale from the sheriff. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370].),805
Certificate of sale. Contents. Effect. Contents.]-Upon the sale of real property, the officer making the same must make out and subscribe duplicate certificates of the sale, containing:,1. A particular description of the premises sold; 2. The price bid for each distinct lot or parcel; 3. The whole consideration money paid; 4. The time when such sale will become absolute, and the purchaser will become entitled to a conveyance. (3 R, 8. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370].),The whole sum bid must be inserted in the certificate. (Mascraft v. Van Antwierlj, 3 Cow. 334.) And if the sheriff advertised to sell on one execution only, he can state no other in the certificate. (lb.),The certificate need not be under oath. (Averill v. Wil- son, 4 Barb. 180.),Filing and recording.]-One of the duplicate certificates, within ten days after the sale, must be filed in the office of the clerk of the county, and the other delivered to the purchaser. If there are two or more purchasers, a certifi- cate must be delivered to each. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370].),The clerk, or register of the county, must record the certificate when filed, and is entitled to the usual fees for recording conveyances, to be paid by the sheriff out of the avails of the sale. (Lates 1857, chl. 60.),The filing of the certificate is not a condition precedent to giving a deed and passing the title (Jaclkson v. Yoltng, 5 Cow. 269), and the officer's omission to do so will not prejudice the purchaser's title. (lb.),.Efect as evidence.]-The original certificate, on being proved or acknowledged as a conveyance, a copy of the original, duly certified by the clerk in whose office the ori ginal is filed (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370]), the record of the certificate, and a certified copy of the record (Iail 1857, ch.. 60) are each receivable as presumptive evidence ,of the facts therein contained. 806
Certificate of sale. Sheriff's deed. If the certificate is given for the whole amount bid, it is conclusive evidence that the property was not sold on condition that prior incumbrances should be paid out of the purchase-money. (Bartlett v. Gale, 4 Paige, 503, 509.),If the plaintiff's attorney bids, and takes a certificate in his own name, the presumption is that he purchased on his own account, and not as agent for the plaintiff. (Chappell v. Dann, 21 Barb. 17.),Rights of assignee.]--The owner of the equity of redemption of a mortgaged leasehold, by becoming the assignee of a certificate of a sale under a judgment junior to the mortgage, acquires no right superior to the mortgage. (N. Y. Shot Co. v. Cary, sp. t., 10 Abb. 44; 20 How. 444.),ART. 15.-Sheriff's deed. After the expiration of fifteen Inllths from the time of the sale of any real property, i' any part thereof remains unredeemed, the officer who made the sale must complete it by executing a conveyance of such property. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 655; [2 id. 373].) It seems that a purchaser, who receives the amount of his bid, and interest at ten per cent. within the year, from a person who has no right to redeem, abandons his right to a deed. (See Plhyfe v. Riley, 15 Wend. 253,) By whom executeld.]-The deed may be executed by the sheriff himself, or by a deputy in his name (Jackson v. Bush, 10 Johns. 223; Sandford v. Roosa, 12 id. 162; Jac7- son v. Davis, 18 id. 7), although the sheriff to whom he is deputy is out of office, provided the land was sold before. (Jacksomn v. Catlin, 3 Cow. 89.) It is not necessary to show that the deputy had a special authority to exe- cute the deed. (Jackson v. Davis, supra.) A deed of land sold by the sheriff while in office, may be executed by him after he has gone out of office,,807
Sheriff's deed. By and to whom executed. although thirteen years have elapsed since the sale. (Averill v. Wilson, 4 Barb. 180.),If a sheriff who has sold any real property dies, or is removed from office, before a conveyance is executed, it may be executed by his under sheriff. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 656, 657; [2 id. 374].),If there is no under sheriff, the court may appoint some proper person to execute the same, on motion of any per- son entitled thereto. Such person must give such security as the court may require. (lb.) NSo security will be required, if nothing is to be done to complete the sale, except the execution of the deed. (Sickles v. Hogeboom, 10 Wend. 562.),To whom executed.]-The deed must be executed either to the original purchaser, or to the creditor who has acquired his title, or to the creditor who has purchased such title from any other creditor. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 655; [2 id. 374].) In case of the death of such person previous to delivery, the deed must be executed and delivered to his executors or administrators. (Ib.),A deed executed to another person at the redeeming creditor's oral request, is valid; and the defendant in the execution cannot object to the regularity of the transac- tion (Merritt ads. Jackson, 1 Wend. 46), but where the party redeeming is a grantee of the debtor, a deed exe- cuted to another person at the grantee's request is void. (Phytfe v. Riley, 15 id. 248.),When an attachment issues against the property of a foreign corporation holding a sheriff's certificate, a purchaser at a sale under the attachment suit, after the time of redemption expires, may require the sheriff to deliver to him a deed to the corporation, and subsequently a deed to himself. (Wright v. Douglass, 2 N.Y. [2 Comst.] 373; 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 572.),An assignee of a purchaser's certificate acquires no title to a deed, until he causes the assignment with due certi- 808

[2 Comst.] 490; 4 Den. 145), but if a deed is executed to him by the sheriff it will be valid, although the assign- ment has not been proved, acknowledged nor filed. (Balnk of Yergenes v. Warren, 7 Hill, 91; Chautauque County Bank v. Nisley, 4 Den. 480.),I-ow compelled.]-A sheriff may be compelled by man- damus to execute a deed to the party entitled to it. And he cannot resist an application for a mandamus on the ground that he has already executed one to another per- son, who has conveyed to a purchaser in good faith. (People v. 1'le;minlg, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 484; 4 Den. 137.),If a deed has been improvidently executed to the pur- chaser, the court will complel the sheriff by mandamus to execute another to a redeeming creditor entitled thereto, but will not direct the first deed to be canceled. (People v. Haskins, 7 Wend. 463.),Contents.]-The deed must describe the premises sold, with certainty; for, if it does not identify them, it passes no title. (Peck v. IMallnams, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 509; ~Mason v. WhiVte, 11 Barb. 173; Jackson v. Delancey, 13 Johns. 535, 551; Jackson v. Bosevelt, id. 97.) Thus, if the lands are described as "all the lands of the defendants, situate in the Hardenburgh patent" (Jackson v. Rosevelt, supra), or as " all the other lands whereof the defendants were seized within the county of Ulster" (Jackson v. Delancey, supra), or as " )bout one hundred acres" of a tract described by boundaries (Peck v. lallams, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 509, 530), or as " all that farm or tract of land in (the town of) P., in the tenure and occupation of the defendant" (see Simonds v. Catlin, 2 Cai. 61), and in no other way, the deed is void.,The deed need not recite the judgment (Averill v. Wil- son, 4 Barb. 180), or the execution under which the sale,102,809

Jones, 9 id. 182, 192); and its validity is not affected by a variance in the recital of the judgment (Jackson v. Streeter, 5 Cow. 529), or of the execution (Jackson v. Pratt, 10 Johns. 381; Jackl son v. Jones, 9 Cow. 182); nor by a variance between the deed and the certificate of sale. (Jackson v. Page, 4 Wend. 585.),It is sufficient if it appears that the judgment and exe- cution were the authority under which the officer acted. (Jackson v. Jones, supra; Averill v. Vilson, 4 Barb. 180; Jackson v. Page, 4 Wend. 585.),Where land is sold under an execution for a larger amount than the judgment lien, and the surplus is paid to the debtor, the latter fact should not be recited in the deed; but if recited, it does not prejudice the purchaser's title. (Sprakcer v. Cook, 16 N. Y. 567.) And if in such case an incumbrancer, upon redeeming, notifies the sher- iss that he disputes the defendant's right to the surplus, the sheriff should not recite this notice; but if he does, it will not qualify the effect of the redemption. (Ib.),Mistake in deed.]-A mistake in a sheriffs deed may be corrected in an action for the purpose, or may be pleaded as a defense, in i ke manner as in the case of other deeds (Bartlett v. Judd, 21 N. Y. 200; DeRiemer v. Caintillonl, 4 Johns. Ch. 85), and such mistake may be proved by parol. (Zb.,),Effect.]-The deed conveys all the right, title and inte- rest sold by the officer. (3 1. S. (5th ed.) 655; [2 id. 374].),The fact that the sherift's deed includes land which he had no authority to convey, does not affect its validity as to other lands over which he had power. (Dickenson v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 481, 498.),* Overruling Mason v. White (11 Barb. 173). 810
Sheriff's deed. To what time it relates. The deed extinguishes a lease made by the judgment debtor after the sale, although made before the execution of the deed. (Wilson v. Darol, 5 Bosw. 619.),To what time deed relates.]-The deed, whenever given, even if there has been unreasonable delay in the matter, provided the purchase-money was paid at the proper time Jackson v. M'6Call, 3 Cow. 75), relates back to the time when the purchaser was entitled to it, viz., fifteen months after the sale (Evertson v. Sawyer, 2 Wend. 507; Bissell v. Payn, 20 Johns. 3); but not to the time of sale (ib.), as it (lid prior to the statute of 1820 (ch. 184), which first enacted the fifteen months provision. (Jackson v. I'Call, 3 Cow. 75; Jackson v. Dic7kenson, 15 Johns. 309.) The dic- tum in Wright v. Douglass (2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 373), which seems to imply that the old rule is still in force, was based exclusively upon the old cases, without notic- ing the later decisions.,Nevertheless, the purchaser has a lien from the time of the sale, superior to all subsequent claims on the premises.,A sheriff's deed does not relate back, to the prejudice of a prior deed obtained under a senior judgment by another person who was not instrumental in delaying the execution of the deed last executed. (Lathrop v. cerguson, 22 Wend. 116.),Whenl void.]-The deed confers no title if, at the time of its execution, the sheriffs power to make it is not sub- sisting, e. g., when the lands have been already redeemed by a prior incumbrance. (Stafford v. Williams, 12 Barb. 240.) A deed executed to the purchaser after a redemp- tion by the debtor's grantee, is void. (P7lyfe v. Riley, 15 Wend. 248.),If the sheriff executes a deed to a redeeming creditor without authority, it is void as against a deed to the pur- chaser. (Dic7enlson v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 481, 499; Hall v. Tlomas, 27 Barb. 55.),811
Sheriff's deed. Payment by debtor of judgment debtor. If a purchaser at a foreclosure sale, under a mortgage subject to a senior judgment, redeems from that judg- ment, and takes a deed under the sale on that judgment, the deed is void as against a subsequent purchaser under a junior judgment which is prior to the mortgage. (Stafford v. Williams, 12 Barb. 240.),If the officer sells and conveys a specific part of the debtor's real property, intending to sell the whole, his subsequent conveyance of other land founded on the prior sale, and executed after returning the execution satisfied, is void. (Jacksoc v. Striker, 1 Johns. Cas. 284.),Setting aside.]-A party aggrieved may move to set aside the sale and deed (Jacklson v. Roberts, 7 Wend. 83; Jaclcson v. Vanderlheyden, 17 Johns. 167; Jackson v. Stern- bergh, 20 Johns. 49), or bring an action for that purpose. (Jackson v. Roberts, supra.),If the sheriff, by mistake, records but does not deliver an irregular deed, and then executes a regular conveyance, the former will be set aside, and confirmation of the latter follows without an order to that effect being necessary. (Bay v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 220.) AR. 16.-Payment to sheriff by debtor of judgment debtor.,Any person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to a sheriff' holding an execution against property of the judgment debtor the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execution. (Code, Â§ 293.),This section does not authorize payment of the amount of a verdict for a wrong, before the verdict has been con- summated by a judgment; for, until then, such a verdict is not a debt. (Davenport v. Ludlow, sp. t., 4 How. 337; 3 Code Rep. 66.) Nor does it authorize payment by a person who is not indebted to the judgment debtor. Thus, after a verdict is assigned, the party against whom it is rendered is indebted to the assignee and not to the as- signor, whether he has notice of the assignment or not', 812
Payment by debtor of judgment debtor. Application of proceeds. therefore he cannot, by paying the amount of the verdict to an olicer holding an execution against the assignor, prevent the assignee from collecting the amount of the verdict from such party. (Richardson v. Ainsworth, 20 How. 521; Lyman v. Cartwright, 3 E. D. Smith, 117; Countrymanj v. Boyer, sp. t., 3 How. 386; 2 Code R. 4; Robinson v. Weeks, 6 How. 161.),A judgment for the wrongful conversion of exempt property is a debt, the amount of which may be paid to. the sheriff. (Mallory v. Norton, 21 Barb. 424.) If no receipt is given by the sheriff, and the alleged payment does not appear to have been in any way applied to the payment of the execution, or treated as a payment by the parties at the time, the transaction will not amount to a payment under Â§ 293 of the Code. (Carroll v. Coi;e, 40 Barb. 220.),ART. 17.-Application of proceeds. Proceeds.]-Although the officer sells under one execu- tior,, he may, at any time before the return day, apply the proceeds to another which he discovers to have a prior lien. (PIee v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 45.) If he sells under prior and subsequent judgments, an intermediate judgment creditor may compel him by mandamus to apply the amount bid to the payment of the earliest liens. (Barker v. Gates, sp. t., 1 How. 77.),When several executions upon judgments docketed at the same time are delivered to the officer together, the avails of a sale of personal property under both are ap- plied in equal amounts to each until the smaller one is satisfied. (Campbell v. Ruger, 1 Cow. 215.),The proceeds of a sale under an execution against the maker of a note, on a judgment confessed by him to the indorser, issued while an action by the holder is pending against the maker, will be applied to the execution in favor of the maker in such action, although it was not first delivered. (Bankc of Auburn v. Throop, 18 Johns. 505.) In such cases, if the equitable rights of the parties,813
Application of proceeds. Partnership property. Adverse claims. are clearly ascertained, they will be protected by the court. (Ib.),The proceeds of an execution on a judgment to enforce a prior judgment are applied first to satisfy the principal and interest, and not the costs, of the prior judgment, although the proceeds may be insufficient to satisfy the costs as well as the debt recovered by the second judg- ment. (Harvey v. Wood, 5 Wend. 221.),Partnership property, levied on under an execution against one of the partners, is not applicable on such execution, until all the firm debts are paid. (AMiir v. Leitch, 7 Barb. 341; see Payne v. Matthews, 6 Paige, 19; Nicholl v. Mumford, 4 Johns. Oh. 522; Jackson v. Cornell, 1 Sands. Oh. 348.) If a sale of personal property belong- ing to a firm, is made under an execution against one of the members, the proceeds will be applied upon such exe- cution, although an execution against the firm was deliv- ered to the sheriff before the sale, if it was delivered so late that sufficient time could not elapse to advertise a sale under it, before the sale under the other execution. (Fenton v. .Foler, 21 Wend. 676.),Where there are adverse claimants to the proceeds of a sale under an execution, and the officer would be per- sonally liable if he delivers the money to the wrong person, the court may order it to be paid into court to await its further order. (Ackcer v. Ledyard, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 62.) The Supreme Court has power, upon the motion of the plaintiff in an execution issued by the Com- mon Pleas, against which an execution from the Supreme Court has become dormant, to order the officer not to apply the proceeds of a sale under the Supreme Court execution to its satisfaction, until the other execution is satisfied. (Kimball v. 2Munger, 2 Hill, 364.),Where a sheriff receives cash in payment of an execu- tion, he cannot make a direct and immediate application and payment of it upon an execution in his hands against 814
Application of proceeds. Surplus. the judgment creditor. (MAtscott v. Woolworth, 14 How. 477; Turner v. Fendall, 1 Cranch, 117; Thlomplson v. Brown, 17 Pick. 462.),Sutrplcs.]-Surplus moneys arising on a sale under exe- cution are subject to the control of the court, while they remain in the officer's hands (Tan rNest v. Yconmans, 1 Wend. 87), and will be ordered to be paid to a junior judgment creditor (Ball v. Ryers, 3 Cai. 84); although the debtor orders the officer to pay them to a person who has no lien on them (Van Nest v. Yeomans, supra), and although the lien of the junior judgment has expired. (People v. Ulster C. P., 18 Wend. 628.),The liens of subsequent mortgages and judgments are transferred, according to their priority, to the surplus aris- ing on a sale under a prior judgment. (Avcrill v. Louc;s, 6 Barb. 470, 478.) Before the Code, the court -efused to interfere on motion when the equitable rights of claimants to a surplus were not clearly ascertained. (Williams v. Rlogers, 5 Johns. 163.),A grantee of real property sold under an execution against the grantor, on a judgment entered prior to his conveyance, is entitled to the surplus in preference to a creditor whose judgment is entered subsequently. (Every v. Edgerton, 7 Wend. 259.),The purchaser of a certificate of sale of lands under a judgment satisfied by such sale, cannot obtain moneys in the officer's hands arising on a subsequent sale of the same lands on a prior judgment, or have them applied to the judgment under which he holds his certificate. (Smith v. Caswell, sp. t., 1 How. 133.) If there is a surplus after satisfying an execution under which a sale of personal property is made, it must be applied to the execution next delivered to the officer before the sale, although no formal levy was made under the latter. (Slade v. Van Vechten, 11 Paige, 21.),815
Application of proceeds. Satisfaction of proceeds. When the debtor does nothing to encourage the pur- chaser to bid, at a sale under a judgment which is subse- quently reversed his receiving the surplus after satisfying the judgment will not preclude him from disputing the purchaser's title. (Wood v. Jackson, 8 Wend. 9, 31.),ART. 18.-Satisfaction of execution. An execution against property is satisfied as soon as the officer has realized a sum sufficient for, and applicable to, its payment. (Gray v. Grisiold, sp. t., 7 How. 44.),Payment 7how made.]-Payment must be actual and in cash. The debtor's agreement with the officer, that the latter should pay the execution on account of his indebt- edness to the debtor, for which the latter gives a receipt in full, is not payment or satisfaction. (Codwise v. Field, 9 Johns. 263.),The sheriff's taking a promissory note for the amount of the execution, without the plaintiff's assent, will not operate as a payment, even though the execution is returned satisfied. (Baink of Orange County v. Wakeman 1 Cow. 46; Mtumnford v. Arm)stronlg, 4 id. 553); other- wise, if the plaintiff ratifies the transaction and treats it as payment. (Armstrong v. Garrotv, 6 Cow. 465; Yoorhees v. Gros, sp. t., 3 How. 262, 264.) A sheriff cannot take a bond or other security, and still hold the execution in his hands, and use it afterwards to enforce payment. (Reed v. Pruyn, 7 Johns. 426; Hoyt v. Hudson, 12 id. 207; Voor- iees v. Gros, supra.) Collateral security.]-Whlere the judgment creditor real- izes on collateral security given to secure the judgment, the judgment is thereby satisfied. (Craft v. Merrill, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 456.),Levy not a satisfaction.]-The doctrine that a levy upon sufficient property to satisfy an execution is a satisfaction of the judgment, which was held in some of the old 816
Satisfaction of execution. When levy is satisfaction. cases (JTacksoi v. Bowen,7 Cow. 13,' 21; .Ezp. Lawrence, 4 id. 417; Hoyt v. Hudson, 12 Johns. 207; Troup v. Wood, 4 Johns. Cli. 228), is no longer received; though it doubtless still holds as respects junior bona fide incum- brancers (Hayden v. Agent of Auburn State Prison, 1 Sands. Ch. 195) and purchasers. (Voorhees v. Gros, sp. t., 3 How. 262; Wood v. Torrey, 6 Wend. 562.),The rule now is, that the levy is only satisfaction sub naldo, and not absolute. Where the debtor has neither paid the debt, nor been deprived of his property, the simple act of levying upon it is not a satisfaction, whether the debtor has been permitted to retain the property by, his own misconduct, or by his request, or by the voluntary act of the officer, because neither works any wrong to him. (Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 o0mst.] 451; )envrey v. Fox, 22 Barb. 522; People v. Hopson, 1 Den. 574; Ostrandcr v. Walter, 2 Hill, 329; Green v. Burke, 23 Wend. 490.),The levy is not a satisfaction where the property is withdrawn by the debtor from the.power of the officer, fraudulently (Miickles v. Haskin, 11 Wend. 125), or with the plaintiff's consent (FWogd v. Torrey, 6 id. 562, as construed in Mlickles v. Haskin, supra); or is restored to the debtor at his request and for his benefit (Ostrauler v. Walter, supra), or on a promise which he violates (Holbrook v. CliampuZiln, Hoffm. 148); or where he denies his owner- ship (Ontario Bank v. Hallett, 8 Cow. 192); or where the sheriff abandons the levy because the creditor does not indemnify him, leaving the property in the debtor's pos- session (Radde v. Whitney, 4 E. D. Smith, 378); or where the collection of the debt, by force of the levy, is defeated by the act or fault of the creditor. (MeChain v. McKeon, 2 Duer, 645,J48.),A levy, under an execution upon a judgment confessed by a third party as collateral security for a judgment against the principal debtor, is iot a satisfaction of the latter. (Ontario Bank v. Hallett, 8 Cow. 192.),103,,817
Satisfaction of execution. Levy and sale, Arrest. Levy on real property.]-A mere levy on real property, when the debtor has not in fact suffered any loss, and the creditor has gained nothing beyond what he already had, by the lien of his judgment, is not satisfaction. (Sltepard v. Rowe, 14 Wend. 260; see Taylor v. Ranney, 4 Rill, 619.),Sale.]-Levy and sale is satisfaction, although a fraudu- lent agreement is made between the parties to the execu- tion, that the property be bought in by the plaintiff, at the sale, and then left in the defendant's possession. (Gardenier v. Tubbs, 21 Wend. 169.),The execution is constructively satisfied by a fraudulent agreement between the owners of the execution and third parties, to prevent a fair sale and free competition among bidders. (Troup v. Wood, 4 Johns. Ch. 228.),Although an execution has been formally satisfied by a sale under it, the satisfaction may be defeated by a recovery, by a third person, to whom the property tati V belonged (Newla7lnd v. Baker, 21 TWend. 264; see Richard- son v. M'Dougall, 19 id. 80), or by the debtor's obtaining judgment against the plaintiff, on the ground that the property levied on was exempt. (Piper v. Elwood, 4 Den. 165.),How compulted.]-If part of the property levied on belongs to an insolvent firm of which the debtor is a member, that part must be excluded in ascertaining whether the levy is upon sufficient property to satisfy the execution. (MllIir v. Leitch, 7 Barb. 341, 348.),DocUeting satisfaction.]-When an execution is satisfied, the sheriff may deliver a certified copy, and the clerk is *to enter satisfaction of judgment upon the docket. (Laws 1860, ch. 6.),Recovery of money paid.]-Money paid to satisfy a valid judgment cannot be recovered back on the ground that the execution was irregularly issued. (Rotlh v. Schloss, 6 Barb. 308.) 818
The judgment creditor has title to the money collected on an execution until tie judgment is reversed, notwith- standing the pendency of a writ of error or certiorari; and having paid the money to a creditor, the latter acquires a complete right to hold it, although the judg- ment is afterwards reversed. (Langley v. Warner, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.] 327.),CHAPTER CXVII,REDEMPTION. AnTIcLE 1. What may be redeemed.,2. Who may redeem. 3. Within what time redemption may be made. 4. Mode of redemption. 5. EffeCt of redemption. ART. 1.-hVlat may be redeemed. Real estate and leaseholds.]-The Revised Statutes (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370J) authorizing the redemption of "real estate," and not extending to estates for years (People v. Westervelt, 17 Wend. 674; 20 id. 614, approved 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.} 159; see Merry v. Hallett, 2 Cow. 497; Evertsen v. Sawyer, 2 Wend. 507, 511), the benefit of their provisions has been extended to leasehold property where the lessee, or the assignee of the lessee, is possessed of at least five years unexpired term of the lease, and also to any building that may be erected thereon. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 658; Laws of 1837, ch. 462; Exlp. Wilson, 7 Hill. 150.) The five years are calculated from the time of the sale, and not from the date of docketing judgment. (Exp. Wil- son, supra.),Whether a rent charge reserved on a lease in fee sold on execution can be redeemed, seems doubtful. (Huntington v. -orkson, 6 Hill, 149.),819 REDEMPTION.
Parcels.]-Parcels or portions of parcels, separately sold, may be redeemed separately (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 651, 652; [2 id. 370, 371]), although all the parcels were bought by one purchaser. (Dickenson v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 481.),The whole of a lot may be redeemed by a creditor, although he has a lien on a portion of it only. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 653; [2 id. 372]; Laws 1847, ch. 410, Â§ 2; Ieil son v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 565, 572.),Undivided shares.]-The share of one of several joint tenants (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652, 653; [2 id. 371, 372]) or tenants in common (ib.; Beeklan v. Bunn, Hill & D. Supp. 265; Eurwin v. Schriver, 19 Johns. 379; Neilson v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 565), may be redeemed.,A judgment creditor of one of several tenants in com- mon, cannot redeem the estates of all of them. The right to redeem is co-extensive only with the lien. (Erwin v. Schriver, supra.),Owner's interest.]-The owner of land subject to a judgment, who buys at a sale under it, not being the judgment debtor, holds such an interest under the judg- ment as may be redeemed by a creditor having a lien. (Chautanque Co. Bk. v. Bisley, 19 N. Y. 369, 379.),Interests by agreement.]-It seems that a creditor can redeem only the interest which a purchaser takes under the statute, and not an interest created by agreement between the purchaser and the debtor, modifying their statutory rights. (Miller v. Lewis, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 554.),ART. 2.-Who may redeem. Debtor.]-Redemption may be made by the person against whom the execution issued, and whose right and title were sold in pursuance thereof (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 370], or, if dead, by his devisees of the premises, if any, and if none, by his heirs. (Ib.) 820,REDEMPTION.
A judgment debtor cannot redeem after a foreclosure sale made subsequently to the sale on execution, even when the mortgage was given prior to the sale on exe- cution. (Kusted v. Dakin, 17 Abb. 137.),Grantee.]-Redemption may also be made by any grantee of the execution debtor, who has acquired an abso- lute title to the premises, or to any parcel or portion sepa- rately sold (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371]); under which head are included the trustees of an absconding debtor (Pliyfe v. Riley, 15 Wend. 248), but not a mortgagee, nor his assignee (Van Rensselaer v. Sheriff of Albany, 1 Cow. 501), nor one who has an equitable right to a sheriff's deed, but to whom a deed has not been executed. (Lathrop v. Fcrguson, 22 Wend. 116; see Russell v. Allen, 10 Paige, 249.),Creditor.]-Redemption may also be made by any creditor having in his own name, or as assignee, repre- sentative, trustee or otherwise, a judgment rendered, or mortgage recorded, at any time before the expiration of fifteen months from the time of the sale, which is a lien or charge upon the premises, or upon any parcel separately sold. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371]; Laws of1847, ch. 410, Â§ 2.),The owner of a judgment which is a lien on any undi- vided share, e. g., the share of a tenant in common (Bee7k- man v. Bunn, Hill & D. Supp. 265), may redeeni that share. (3 R. S. (5h ed.) 653; [2 id. 372].) Before 1847 it was necessary that the redeeming judg- ment creditor should have a judgment against the debtor in the execution on which the land was sold (Ex parte Wood, 4 Hill, 542), and that a redeeming mortgage credi- tor should be the creditor of such debtor. (Hodge v. Gal- lup, 3 Den. 527.) The law is now otherwise. (Laws 1847, ch. 410, Â§ 1; see Hodge v. Gallup, 3 Den. 527, iote.),821 REDEMPTION.
Who may redeem. Creditor. Any judgment creditor may redeem against the pur- chaser (Jaccson v. Butdd, 7 Cow. 658), or against any other redeeming creditor by judgment (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 653; L-' id. 372]), or mortgage, (Laws of 1847, bh. 410, Â§ 2), without reference to priority of liens.,A senior judgment creditor may redeem from a sale under a junior judgment (Ex parte Perut Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540; People v. Fleming, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 484; 4 Den. 137), although the redeeming creditor also held one of the judgments on which the sale was made. (People v. .Fleming, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 484.),When a junior judgment creditor purchases under a sale, and a judgment creditor junior to himself redeems, the former may redeem firom the latter. (J'ackson v. Butdd, 7 Cow. 658.),A junior judgment creditor may redeem, although his judgment was confessed for the express purpose of en- abling him to redeem, if it was entered on full considera- tion. (Snyder v. Warren, 2 Cow. 518; see Van l ensselaer v. Sleriff of Albany, 1 id. 501.),A judgment creditor does not iose his right to redeem by purchasing under another judgment. (Jackson v. Bltdd, 7 Cow. 658.),A judgment creditor retains his right to redeem, al- though he agrees to postpone the time of payment of the amount due on his judgment (l'utir v. Leitch, 7 Barb. 341, 351), and although his judgment is paid in part (ib. 349), and although he holds other security besides the judg- ment (ib. 354), and although the purchaser pays to the 'sheriff the amount of the judgment which entitles the judgment creditor to redeem, after the latter has paid the sheriff the necessary redemption money, and has begun to deliver the evidences of his right to redeem. (People v. Beebe, sp. t., 1 Barb. 379, 385.),A judgment creditor may redeem, although the amount of the judgment has been tendered to the officer holding an execution issued on it, but has not been accepted by 822
him. (People v. Beebe, sp. t., 1 Barb. 379; Jacksson v. Law, 5 Cow. 248; see Exp. Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540, 558.),A creditor upon a justice's judgment may redeem, although his judgment was obtained upon attachment. (Ex zarte Carmichael, 5 Cow. 17.),A judgment of foreclosure, entered but not docketed, is not a lien, so as to authorize a redemption under it. (Peoplqe v. Beebe, supra.),One holding a judgment as assignee, is entitled to redeem (Van Rensselaer v. Sheriff of Onondaga, 1 Cow. 443; Ex parte Raymond, 1 Den. 272) if the transfer is absolute (Ex parte .-aymond, supra; Beeklman v. Bunn, Hill & D. .Supp. 265), although part of the consideration for the assignment remains to be paid on a contingency (Ex parte Raymond, supra), and although an equitable right remains in the assignor to the surplus after satisfying the the debt, to secure which the assignment was made. ,(Beelnumt v. Bunn, supra.),One of several co-assignees of a judgment may redeem for the benefit of all. (Ib.) But, it seems that an assignee of part of a judgment cannot redeem. (Ib.),After the judgment creditor's lien is extinguished he cannot redeem. Â· Thus a junior judgment creditor, who sells under his judgment, has no lien after fifteen months from the sale which will authorize him to redeem from a sale under a senior judgment (Ex parte Stevens, 4 Cow. 133), although the sale is for less than the amount of his judgment (Ib.), and although he himself is the purchaser. (People v..Easton, 2 Wend. 297.) So, a junior judgment .creditor, whose lien has been satisfied by a sufficient levy, cannot redeem from a sale under a senior judgment. (Exparte Lawrence, 4 Cow. 417.) A junior creditor, whose lien has been extinguished by the lapse of fifteen months since a sale under an interme- diate judgment, cannot afterwards redeem from a subse- ,quent sale under a senior judgment. (Exp. Elswood, 1 Den. 633.),823 REDEMPTION.
A sale under a judgment of foreclosure extinguishes its lien, and thereafter the plafntiff is not entitled to redeem by virtue thereof. (.Pciple v. Beebe, sp. t., 1 Barb. 379, 388.) But a creditor having a judgment against two par. cels of land may redeem, although he was a party to a foreclosure of a mortgage on one parcel, and the decree extinguished his lien on that parcel. (Ib.; 3 R. S. 653; [2 id. 372, Â§ 53].),A senior judgment, after ten years from the time of docketing have expired, remains a lien as against the debtor, so as to authorize its owner to redeem. (Exparte Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540.),The judgment creditor, under whose judgment a sale is made, cannot redeem by virtue of that judgment (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 654; [2 id. 373] ; Husted v.

But he may avail himself of any other judgment held by him in the same manner and on the same terms as any other creditor: (3 R. S., supra; People v. Fleming, supra.) If he bids less than the amount of his judgment, and the debtor acquires a subsequent title to the property, which divests that of the purchaser, lie retains a lien for the balance, which will entitle him to redeem as a judgment creditor. (Russell v. Alien, supra.).,Although creditors, holding judgments docketed at the same instant, agree at the time of docketing that what- ever is collected under them shall be applied ratably to each, this will not authorize them to redeem from each (other.

Allen, 10 Paige, 249.),Creditor.]-Redemption by a creditor must be made within fifteen months after the sale (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; '[2 id. 371]), if no preceding redemption has been made; if a preceding redemption has been made, the creditor may redeem within twenty-four hours thereafter. (Laws 1847, eh. 410.) This extension of time is provided only for cases where a valid redemption has been previously made. (People v. lathbunn, 15 N. Y. 528, 531.),Computation of time.] The fifteen months signify calen- dar, not lunar months. (Snyder v. Warren, 2 Cow. 518.) The right may be exercised on the last day. (Ib.; People v. Sherif of fBroome, 19 Wend. 87; Laws 1847, ch. 410, Â§ 3.) If the last day is Sunday, redemption must be made on Saturday. The Monday following is too late. (People v. Luther, 1 Wend. 42.) The redemption may be made at any hour before 12 P. m. of the last day. Busi ness hours are not regarded in this case. (Ex parte Bank of Monroe, 7 Hill, 177; see Ex parte Rayownd, 1 Den 272.),Extension of timie.]-The time within which the debtor may redeem may be extended by agreement between him and the purchaser, although judgment creditors sub sequent-to the agreement are thereby prevented from redeeming.

1. A copy of the docket of the judgment under which he claims the right to purchase (3 R. S. (5th ed. 654); [2 id. 373]; People v. Collier, 19 Wend. 87; WaIler v. Harris, 7 Paige, 167; 20 Wend. 555), duly certified by the clerk of the court, or of the county in which the judgment is docketed (3 R. S., supra), and, it seems, in which the land lies (Woolsey v. Saunders, 3 Barb. 301), but this certificate need not be sealed, nor show that the instrument stated to be a copy has been "compared" or is " correct." People v. Ransomn; 4 Den. 145; see S. 0., 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 490, 496.).,2. The original assignment, if any, of such judgment (Hall v. Thomas, 27 Barb. 55; Ex parte Newell, 4 Hill, 608, 611), so far as may be necessary to establish his claim; or a true copy thereof (3 R. S., supra), duly verified by the affidavit of the redeeming creditor, or of some witness to such assignments (3 R. S., supra; Hall v. Thomas, 27 Barb. 55), identifying the assignment as the instrument under which the creditor claims to hold the judgment# {Hall v. Thomas, supra; Exp. Newell, supra), and the judgment assigned as that under which the assignee *applies to redeem (Ayleswortli v. Brown, sp. t., 10 Barb. 167); though a mistake in the amount of the judgment, or in the time of its recovery, or the name of the attorney, or an omission of the plaintiff's middle name, is not material. (Ib.),3. An affidavit by such creditor, or by his attorney or agent, of the true sum due on such judgment at the time of claiming such right to purchase. (3 B. S., supra; People v.

law, by death and appointment of an administrator, it is not necessary to. produce a copy of the letters of adminis- tration, or any evidence of representative character. (Peo- ple v. Flemidng, 2 N. . [2 omst.] 484.),The verification of an assignment by an affidavit stating "that deponent is the assignee and owner in good faith of said judgment according to the annexed copies of the transfer thereof by" the judgment creditor is sufficient. (Ex parte Newell, 4 Hill, 608.) So, the verification of two successive assignments, set out at length, front R. to G., and from G. to the redeeming creditor, stating that "the foregoing assignments are true an4u correct copies of the original ',ssignments of R. and G." (Ayleswort& v. .Brown, sp. t., 1- Barb. 167), or stating that "the follow- ing is a true and correct copy of the original assignment of R. to G." and after giving a literal copy, proceeding to state that " said G. sold and assigned said judgment to this deponent, and the following is a true and correct copy of the said original assignment," is sufficient. (Ib.) The verification of an assignment cannot be made by a mere acknowledgment certified by an officer, as in the case of a conveyance of land. (Exparte Newiell, supra.) If not made by the redeeming creditor in person, it should be made by the subscribing witness (Ex parte Aldrich, 1 Den. 662), or, if there is no subscribing witness (People v. Â·7lening, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 484), or no subscribing wit- ness'who is competent and attainable (ib.), it should be made by some witness who was present at the execution of the assignment. The affidavit-of a mere agent, who .ras not present, is not sufficient. (lb.) An innocent overstatement of the amount due on the judgment, in the affidavit on that subject, has been held not to vitiate it (Muir v. Leitcli, 7 Barb. 341, 350); but a different. opinion has been expressed. (Per DAVIES, J., Smith v. Miller, 25 N. Y. 619.) Â· The attorney for the plaintiff in the judgment cannot make the affidavit by virtue of that character alone; it,REDEMPTION.,827
must appear from his affidavit that he is such attorney at the time. (Ex parte Shumway, 4 Den. 258.*) The affi. davit must certainly contain a direct averment of the attorneyship or agency of the deponent. A mere descrip. tion of him as attorney or agent will not suffice. (Exp. Ban7c of M1onroe, 7 Hill, 177; Exp. Shumway, supra.),This affidavit may be made a few days (e.g., five) before presenting it. (_ir yrte Newell, 4 Hill, 608, 611.),*Whatt miust be presented by mortgage creditor.]-A credi- tor by mortgage, his assignees or representatives, must present:,1. A copy of tOe mortgage under which he claims the right to purchase, duly certified by the clerk of the county 'where the mortgage is recorded (3 R. S.

(Ib.),The statement of the amount due, or to become due, must be such that, perjury might be assigned thereon, if untrue (People vy Becker, 20 N. Y. 354); thus, a statement that there is due the amount named, "as claimed by this deponent," is insufficient. (lb.) , i Â· But aee, to the contrary, People v. Ransom (2 N. Y.

When the affidavit is made by an agent, he should swear! that he is agent; merely describing himself as such is not sufficient (Exlparte Bank of 3Monroe, 7 Hill, 177); and he should disclose his knowledge of the amount due, and state the amount on such knowledge, and not on belief merely. (lb.) * The affidavit need not state how the affiant knows that the amount stated is due. (Neilson v. Neilson, 5 Barb. 565, 572.) The affidavit may be made a* few days before it is pre- sented, and before the time has arrived when the creditor may redeem. (People v. Ransom, 2 Hill, 51.) Evidences when to be delivered.--The evidences of the right to redeem need not be delivered cotemporaneously with the payment of the money; the officer may receive the money first and allow the party redeeming to show his title afterwards. (Exp. Board, 4 Cow. 420.) , Evidences to wlwn delivered.]-The evidences of the right to redeem, if presented the last day of the 15 months, must be presented to and left with the purchaser, or the prior redeeming creditor, or the officer who made the sale. (3 .. S. (5th ed.) 655; [2 id. 373].) In either case, they must be delivered to the same person to whom the redemption money is paid. (People v. Rahsom, 4 Den. 146; 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 490.) Thus if the money is paid to the purchaser, they must be delivered to him, and delivery to the officer would not be sufficient. (Ib.) If the evidences are presented on or after the last day of the fifteen months, they must be delivered to the officer who made the sale, if present at the sheriff's office; if absent, then the sheriff, or if absent, to his under-sheriff or deputy. (See 3 R. S. (5th ed.) 656; Laws 1847, c7l. 410; People v. Rathblun, 15 N. Y. 528; Grifin v. Chase, 23 Barb. 278.) If a redemption has already been made, the papers must be delivered to the prior redeeming creditor,829 REDEMPTION.
or to the officer, and not to the original purchaser. (3 1. S. (5th ed:) 655; [2 id. 373]; People v. Baker, 20 Wend. 602.),'Waiver of presentation.]-The sheriff cannot dispense with the presentation of any of the evidences of the right to redeem, required by the statute (People v. Covell, 18 WVend. 598; see People v. Collier, 19 id. 87; Walter v. Harris, 7 Paige, 167, 176; Bank of Vergennes v. Waroren, 7 Hill, 91; Hall v. Thomas, 27 Barb. 58); c. g., the de- livery of an affidavit of.the amount due on the judg- ment in virtue of which a creditor claims to redeem (People v. Covell, supra; see Bank of Vergennes v. Warrc)qi, supra), or of a copy of the docket (People v. Collier, supra; Waller v. Harris, supra); or of a verification of the assignment. (Hall v. Thomas, supra.),But the purchaser may waive any of the conditions made by the statute for his benefit, as far as he is person. ally concerned (Bank of Yergennes v. Warren, supra; see People v. Covell, supra); thus, he may dispense with any affidavit of the amount due on the judgment. (Ib.) Such waiver, however, does not affect other redeeming credi- tors. (People v. Ransom, 4 Den. 145; 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 490.) Thus where a judgment creditor pays the pur- chaser the amount of his bid, but produces no evidences of his right to redeem, the purchaser waiving the same, another creditor may redeem as if nothing had been done by the first creditor. (Ib.),Payment, by wlhom mnade.]-Payment may be made by one of several joint owners of a judgment for the benefit of all. (Bee7kmnan v. Bunn, Hill & D.

R. 53; sp. t., 9 Barb. 17, 23.) Payment by a creditor, if made before the last day of the fifteen months, may be made to the purchaser, or redeeming creditor, his representatives or assigns, or to the officer who made the sale, for the use of the purchaser or creditor entitled. (3 :; S. (5th ed.) 654; [2 id. 373]; 'x parte Board, 4 Cow. 420.) If made on or after the last day of the fifteen months, it must be made at the sheriff's office in the county in which the sal, took place; if the officer who made the sale is absent from the office at such time, redemption may be made to the sheriff, and, in his ab- sence, to the under-sheriff or any deputy present at such office. (3 1. 8. (5th ed.) 656; Lawzs 1847, chl. 410.) If none of these persons are present, redemption cannot be made to a third person, who has not been appointed by the sheriff to act as his under-sheriff or deputy, e. g., to the clerk of the county, whose office is also that of the sheriff. (Peo- ple v. Rathbtun, 15 N. Y. 528; Gfiffin v. Chase, 23 Barb. 278.),If money, paid by a creditor attempting to redeem, but who has failed to comply with the requirements of the statute, is received by the original purchaser after the time has elapsed in which he might redeem as judgment creditor, and repaid by him to an unauthorized person, this will not aiobunt to a ratification of the first ineffec- tual redemption. (Ib.) Payment may be made in every case to the officer who made the sale (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 654; [2 i. 373, 5 59]); it may therefore be mado to the sheriff or the deputy who sold the premises; both having made the sale: the deputy in fact, and the sheriff in judgment of law. (Per NELSON, 0. J., People v. Baker, 20 Wend. 602, 604.) Payment may be made to the deputy who made the sale, although the sheriff's term of office has expired by,831
lapse of time. (People v. Baker, supra.) If the sheriff is dead or has been removed from office, payment may be made to his under-sheriff or to the clerk of the county. (3 R..S. 5th ed.) 657; [2 id. 374, Â§ 67.),What must be paid by debtor.]-The judgment debtor, his heirs, devisees or grantees, must pay the amount of the bid, with interest at ten per cent. from the time of sale. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 651; [2 id. 370, Â§ 56.),Wiat nmust be paid by first redeeming creditor.]-The creditor by judgment or mortgage who redeems first, must pay the amount of the bid for the premises, with interest at seven per cent from the time of sale (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371]; amended Laws 1847, c7. 410); or if he redeems a parcel separately sold, the amount of the bid for that parcel and interest as above. (lb.),If the judgment of the first redeeming creditor is a lien on an undivided share of the real property sold, he must pay such part of the whole sum bid as is a just propor- tion to the amount of such share. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 653; [2 id. 372, Â§ 54].),A judgment creditor cannot redeem by paying merely the amount of those judgments on which the land was sold which are prior to his own. He must pay the fill amount bid (Silliman v. Wing, 7 Hill, 159; Barker v. Gates, sp. t., 1 How. 77), although part of the land was sold on a judgment younger than his. (Barker v. Gates, supra.),Where a sale is made upon several judgments, a le- demptioner must acquire the title conferred by all of them. and not merely that conferred by those senior to the judgment on which his right to redeem is founded.

S., supra), and not merely the amount of the purchaser's bid and interest. (Exlvarte Ives, 1 Hill, 639.),If the judgment, by virtue of which the first redeeming creditor acquired the purchaser's title, is prior to that of the second redeeming creditor, the latter must also pay the amount due on that judgment (3 R. S., supra; Jackson v. Budd, 7 Cow. 658); if it is subsequent, the second redeeming creditor need not pay the amount due them. (1b.; Rosekrans v. Hughsson, 1 Cow. 428; iMuir v. Leitch, 7 Barb. 341, 347.) A creditor, in order to redeem from a purchaser who has redeemed under a prior mortgage, held by himself, must pay the amount of the mortgage as well as the sum bid and interest. (People v. Ransom, 2 Hill, 51.),W7iat must be paid by third redeeming creditor.]-Any third or subsequent creditor must comply with the same conditions as the prior redeeming creditor. (3 R. 8.

(Ex parte lYewell, 4 Hill, 608; People v. AIuzzy, 1 Den. 239.),Excessive payimentt.]-Payment of more than is neces- sary, does not vitiate a redemption. (Beekiman v. Bunn, Hill & D.

of a mistake of the officer in informing the redeeming creditor of the amount of the purchaser's bid (Ex parte Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540, 542, 560), or of a mistake in computation by the party redeeming, or his agent (HBa v. Fisher, 1 Barb. Ch. R. 53, 59), is ineffectual; but if the deficiency in the payment is caused solely by a mistake of the officer's agent in calculating the amount, the redemption will be upheld. (Hall v. Fisher, sp. t., 9 Barb. 17; see S. C., 1 Barb. Ch. 53, 57; 3 id. 637, 639.) A tri- fling deficiency, e. g., twelve cents (Ex parte Becker, 4 Hill. 613), or thirty cents (Hall v. Fisher, sp. t., 9 Barb. 17, 29), is immaterial.,An insufficient payment is not rendered valid by a subsequent payment of the deficiency. (Elxp. Baynmond, 1 Den. 272.) Thus, where a senior judgment creditor redeems from the purchaser, and then on the last day a creditor holding a junior judgment pays the sheriff the amount of the former judgment only, a subsequent receipt by the sheriff of the amount of the purchaser's bid from the junior creditor does not affect the senior judgment cre ditor's right to a deed. (lb.),Medium of payment.]-If accepted by the officer with- out objection, payment may be made in current bank bills (Hall v. Fisher, sp. t., 9 Barb. 17, 21), or in current coin, not being a legal tender (Ex parte Becker,, 4 Hill, 613), or in a check, if presented and cashed before the time of redemption expires. (People v. Baker, 20 Wend. 602.),The debtor may redeem by paying other property or securities to the purchaser, if he accepts them instead of money. (Stone v. Smith, sp. t., 2 How. 117.),Recailingl pay.met.]'-A creditor who has redeemed by virtue of a judgment junior to that under which the sale was made, cannot recall the money so paid, although he has a judgment older than the latter, and the premises 834,REDEMPTION.
are not worth more than the sum bid by the purchaser. (Anmerican Excuhange Bk. v. Morris Canal Co., 6 Hill, 362.) Ditties of officer.-]-If redemption is made prior to. the last day of the fifteen months, the officer to whom it is made must immediately file in the office of the county clerk a statement thereof, containing the title of the cause, or, if a mortgage, the names of the parties thereto, the amount of the judgment, decree or mortgage, the assignee, trustees or representatives thereof, if any, the amount paid to redeem, the time when the redemption was made and the sum claimed to be due on such judg- ment, decree or mortgage at the time of such redemption, (3.R. S. (5th ed.) 656; Laws 1847, ch. 410.) Whenever a redemption is made, the officer making the sale, or the person lawfully acting in his behalf, must execute to the party redeeming his certificate, stating all such facts transpiring before him at the time of making the redemption as will suffice to show the fact of such redemption. (Ib.) The certificate may be proved or ac- Ikowledged, and recorded, in the same manner and with the same effect as a deed, and the certificate or record, or duly authenticated copy of the record, is rrima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. (Ib.) The officer receives the same fees as for a certificate of sale. (Ib.),ART. 5.-Effect of redemption. By debtor, etc.]-Upon redemption by the debtor, his representatives or grantees, the sale and certificates thereof become null and void (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371, Â§ 49]), and no other proceedings can be founded thereon; thus, if a deed is subsequently executed to the purchaser by the officer, it is void. (Phlyfe v. Riley, 15 Wend. 248.) Where a sale is made on two judgments, and the bid is insufficient to satisfy the junior judgment, if the debtor redeems, the lien of the junior judgment revives, and,835 REDEMPTION.
may be enforced against the land or its proceeds. (Bodir, v. Moore, 18 N. Y. 347, 351.),By creditor.]-Upon redemption by a creditor, the title of the original purchaser is transferred to the redeeming creditor (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 654; [2 id. 373, Â§ 59]), who thereby acquires all the rights of the original purchaser (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371, Â§ 51]; Emmet v. Brad, street, 20 Wend. 50), and the rights of any assignee of the sheriff's certificate (People v. Ransom, 4 Den. 145; see S. 0., 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 490, 492); subject, however, to be defeated by a subsequent redemption. (3 R. 8. (5th ed.) 652; [2 id. 371, Â§ 51].),The judgment, by virtue of which a creditor redeems, is not satisfied by his redeeming under it (Exp. Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540, 542, 558; Emmet v. Bradstreet, supra; Van Horne v. M'Laren, 8 Paige, 285), and he may redeem a second time from a sale under another judgment (EIp. Peru Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540, 542, 558), or maintain an action thereon to.recover its amount (Enmmet v. Brad- street, supra), or a creditor's bill (Fan Home v. M'Laren, supra), although the premises are worth more than the amount of the redemption money paid by him. (Ib.),The effect of a redemption is not avoided by the redeem- ing creditor subsequently serving an injunction upon the officer against paying over the amount. (Exp. Necell, 4 Hill, 589.) The effect of a subsequent redemption is not avoided as against a debtor who fails to redeem within the year, by the fact that the judgment lield by a prior redeeming creditor was paid before he redeemed under it.

When proper. Form.,CHAPTER CXVIII. EXECUTION FOR SPECIIC PROPE.Ty. When propler.]-An execution is the appropriate means of enforcing an ordinary judgment for the delivery of real or personal property (Code, Â§ 285); although a judgment for the delivery of specific chattels may contain a direc- tion, derived from the old equity practice, that the defendant himself deliver them to the plaintiff, in which case the judgment may be enforced by service of a copy, and proceeding as for a contempt. Form.]-In addition to the rules concerning the form of executions generally (ante, p. 747), the following are to be observed. The execution must require the officer to deliver the possession of the property, particularly describ- ing it. to the party entitled thereto; and may at the same time require the officer to satisfy any costs, damages, or rents and profits, recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it was rendered; and if a delivery of the property for which the judgment was recovered cannot be had, then the value thereof, to be specified therein; and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property belonging to him on the day when the judgment was docketed, or at any time thereafter; and is in that respect deemed an execution against property.

Against defendant.]-If the action is one in which the defendant might have been arrested, as provided in % 179 and 181 of the Code, an execution against the person of the defendant may issue:,1. Where an order of arrest has been served (Code, Â§288), before judgment (Ib., %Â§ 183, 204), and has not been vacated; and it is not necessary for this purpose that the judgment roll should contain evidence of the grounds of arrest. (Corwin v. Freeland, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 560 ;* COeney v. Garbutt, sp. t., 5 How. 467; Fake v. Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229; How v. Frear, sp. t., 13 Abb. 241, note; 21 How. 343; Crowell v. Brown, sp. t., 17 How. 68; 9 Abb. 107, note.) 2. When the complaint contains a statement of facts showing one or more of the causes of arrest required by 179 of the Code. (Code, Â§ 288.)t If the complaint shows that part of a claim, remain- ing due, is of a fiduciary character, the defendant is liable to execution against his person. (Pettengill v. Mather, 12 Abb. 436.) : Reversing S. C. (6 How. 241); and overruling ridkley v. M'Cumber (sp t., 5 How. 414; 3 Code Rep. 211). tAs amended, 1862.
In what cases. Against defendant. Against plaintif If the complaint does not contain such statement, and if no order has been made (Code, Â§ 288; lKendeiburg v. Morgan, sp. t., 18 How. 469; see Hump7lrey v. Brown, sp. t., 17 id. 481), or if an order of arrest has been made and vacated (Moleilaor v. KElrner, sp. t., 22 How. 190; 13 Abb. 241, note; Stelle v. Platner, sp. t., 13 Abb. 62; see Meechv. Loomis, sp. t., 14 id. 428; 23 How. 484), or if the state. ments in the complaint on which the arrest is sought, were irrelevant, and not issuable (Stelle v. Platner, supra), an execution against the person cannot issue.,But if an order for the defendant's arrest has been set aside, on conditions to be performed by him, which he fails to perform (Edgerton v. Ford, 11 Abb. 415), or if he has been released from arrest before judgment by the plaintiff's consent (Meech v. Loomis, sp. t., 14 Abb. 428; 23 How. 484), execution against his person may still issue.,Plaintiff.]-If the defendant might have been arrested, execution may issue against the person of the plaintiff, if he is the judgment debtor (Code, Â§ 288; Klopp8enberg v. Neefus, 4 Sands. 655; Merritt v. Carpenter, 30 Barb. 61), although the defendant was not arrested before judgment (Kloppenlerg v. Neeflis, supra); but not where no order of arrest has been served, and the complaint does not con- tain a statement of facts showing a cause of arrest. (Pur- chase v. Bellows, sp. t., 14 Abb. 357; 23 How. 421.*),The plaintiff in an action against a sheriff for a penalty. for irregularity in the sale of real property (Parce v. Hal- .bert, sp. t., 1 How. 235), or in an action for the possession of specific property (Merritt v. Carpenter, 30 Barb. 61), is liable to execution against his person, if judgment therein is rendered against him for costs.,* This rule is correct; the particular application of it made in that cae seems to us erroneous. The action was for the possession of chattels, and the defendant must surely have been liable to arrest for the damages asd costs, even if not for the value of the property. 838
__ _ In what cases. In what actions. .Judgment.,- .. If the plaintiff joins :a cause of action which does not authorize an arrest of the defendant, to another which does, and fails in both, he is liable to execution against his person. (Miller v. Scherder, 2 N. Y. [2 Oomst.] 262.),Int what actios.]--The action must be one in which the defendant might have been arrested, as provided in Â§ 179 and 181 of the Code. (Code, Â§ 288.) The cases in which a defendant may be arrested are fully set forth ante, i. 553-568.,The defendant in an action brought against him, as grantee in a conveyance of personal property, to set aside tile conveyance as fraudulent against the grantor's cre- ditors, cannot be arrested on execution. (Fassett v. Tall- Inadge, 37 Barb. 436; 14 Abb. 188; 23 How. 244.) An action to set aside a conveyance as constructively but not actually fraudulent against creditors, is not one of those in which the defendant can be arrested on execu- tion. (People v. Kelly, 35 Barb. 444; 13 Abb. 405.),Accepting collateral security, which is afterwards re- ceived in part payment, does not change the character of the indebtedness so as to preclude execution against the defendant's person. (Pettingill v. MLather, 12 Abb. 436.),TJudtgmentt.]-When an order of arrest has been served, the judgment need not award execution against the per- son (How v. Frear, sp. t., 21 How. 343; 13 Abb. 241, note; Crowell v. Brown, sp. t., 17 How. 68; 9 Abb. 107, note), nor show that such execution is authorized. (How v. Frear, supra.) Judgmenwt of justice's court.]-Execution against the person cannot issue upon a judgment of a justice's court, which has been docketed so as to become a judgment of .the county court or court of common pleas, if the action is one in which the inferior court had jurisdiction to arrest the defendant. (Iivesey v. Sanders, sp. t., 3 Abb. 176; 12 How. 25.),839
In what cases. How and when issuable. Execution against the person of the defendant may issue out of the Common Pleas, on a transcript of a judg. ment of the Marine Court being filed, and an execution against property issued out of the Common Pleas being returned unsatisfied (Gitwocio v. Figari, 2 Abb. 185; 4 E. D. Smith, 227; Hall v. M2Mahon, 10 Abb. 319); though, even before the transcript is filed, the defendant ob. tains his discharge, without the plaintiff's consent, from an execution against his person issued out ds the Marine Court. (Ginochio v. Figari, supra.),Joint debtors.]-One of two joint judgment debtors may be arrested on execution, although the plaintiff has instructed the officer not to arrest the other. (Fake v. .Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229.),ART; 2.-How and when issuable. Leave.]-It is no more necessary to obtain leave to issue execution against the person than any other kind of execution* (Ginoc7io v. Figari, 4 E. D. Smith, 227; 2 Abb. 185; How v. Frear, sp. t., 13 Abb. 241 n.; 21 How. 343; Eloppenburg v. Neefus, 4 Sands. 655; see Tlrinpkhrey v. Brown, sp. t., 17 How. 481), and the court will not make any order on the subject. The creditor must issue execution at his own risk. (Btll v. Melliss, 13 Abb. 241; Lockwiood v. Slyke, sp. t., 18 How. 45.) Such an order was granted, however, in Livesey v. Sanders (sp. t., 3 Abb.. 176; 12 How. 25); in Pettengill v. Matler (12 Abb. 436); and in Hall v. M'Mahon (10 Abb. 319).,When execution against property has issued within five years after entry of judgment, execution against the person may issue without leave, although five years have elapsed since the entry of judgment, and since the return ,of the other execution. {Kress v. Eilis, sp. t., 14 How. 392.),* To the contrary, see Alden v. Sarson (sp. t., 4 Abb. 102). 840
When issuable. After execution against property. Return of execution against property.]-Execution against the person should not issue until after the return of an execution against the judgment debtor's property, unsat- isfied in whole or in part (Code, Â§ 288); but if issued before, this is an irregularity, merely (Renicki v. Orser, 4 Bosw. 384; Hall v. Ayer, sp. t., 9 Abb. 220; 19 How. 91), which cannot be taken advantage of collaterally (Renick v. Orser, supra); though the arrest will be set aside on motion.,It is not necessary that sixty days should have elapsed between the issuing and the return of the execution against property. It is sufficient if an actual bona fide return has been made. (Fake v. Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229.) Nor is it necessary that the execution against property should have issued to the county where the defendant resides (ib.); thus, if it has issued to the county in which he was arrested, it will be sufficient. (lb.; 3 1. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 363, Â§ 4].),If the defendant is imprisoned on execution in another action, or upon process in the same action, or has been surrendered in exoneration of his bail in such action, execution may issue against his person, without any pre- vious execution against his property. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364, Â§ 5].),No execution against the body of any party can issue while there is an execution against his property not returned. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364, Â§ 6].) Nor can execution issue against the body of a party who has been taken on an execution issued for that purpose (Ib. Â§ 7), except in cases specially provided by law. (lb.; see inlfra.),When must issue.]-When a defendant, at the time judgment is rendered against him is in custody, either upon process in the action in which such judgment has been rendered, or upon being surrendered in discharge of must his bail in such action, the plaintiff in such judgment charge him in execution thereon, within three months,106
When issuable. ... When must issue. Form. after the last day of the term next following that at whieh. the judgment was obtained. If the defendant is surren- dered in discharge of his bail, after such judgment, and his bail thereupon exonerated, the plaintiff must charge him in execution thereon within three months after the surrender, or, if execution has issued against his pro- perty, within three months after the return day of such execution. (3 B1. S. (5th ed.) 870; [2 id. 556, Â§ 36].),A prisoner, although supersedable for not being charged in execution, may still be charged at any time before a supersedeas is allowed (Valentine ads. Manhattan Co., 3 Johns. Cas. 584; Brantinglham's case, 3 id. 416), even after notice of motion for a sutyersedeas. (Brantinghamn's case, supra.),ART. 3.-F-orm of execution. An execution against the person of the judgment debtor should require the officer to arrest and commit the debtor to the jail of the county, until the judgment is paid or the debtor discharged. (Code, Â§ 289.) Where the execution contained the mandatory clause as re- quired by the Code (Â§ 289), but omitted the words "or be discharged," the omission was held wholly immate- rial. (Hiutc7inson v. Brand, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 208.) Nor is it necessary to recite the facts which authorize the arrest (Hutchinson v. Brand, supra; Fake v. Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229), though it might be better to do so (Fullerton v. Fitzgerald, sp. t., 18 Barb. 441; 10 How. 37), nor the return unsatisfied of an execution against the property of the debtor. It is sufficient if these facts exist. (Huttchinson v. Brand, supra.) 842

Arrest.]-It is the duty of the sheriff to ah'est the debtor against whom the execution issues, and to hold him in custody. For the manner in which the arrest may be made see ante, i. 579.,Jail liberties.]-The only bail which the sheriff has a right to accept, is for the jail liberties. (See ante, i. 604.) This he is bound to accept. (Holnes v. Lansing, 3 Johns. Cas. 73; Kip v. Brigliam, 7 Johns. 168.) And he may allow the prisoner the benefit of thejail liberties, without any bail. (Peters v. Henry, 6 Johns. 121; Holmes v. Lan- 'sing, supra.),Effect of arrest.]-The imprisonment on execution of all the defendants (Cooper v. Bigalov, 1 Cow. 56), or of a sole defendant (Sunderland v. Loder, 5 Wend. 58; Bank of Beloit v. Beale, 7 Bosw. 611, 617, 632; see 21assett v. Tall-
The arrest. Its effect. Discharge. madge, 15 Abb. 205, 209), is, as long as it continues, a satisfaction of the debt and judgment. The imprison-. ment suspends the lien of the judgment, and junior judg- ments obtained during the imprisonment obtain priority. (Jac7cson v. Benedict, 13 Johns. 533,) But if the debtor escapes, the judgment revives. (lMc&tinty v. Herrick, 5 Wend. 240.),The arrest of a debtor on execution does not prevent the plaintiff from making a motion to set off the judg. ment on which the execution issued. (Utica Ins. Co. v. Power, 3 Paige, 365.) The imprisonment on execution of one of several defendants in a judgment, is fatal to a joint action against all, so long as it continues. (Chap- ntan v. Hatt, 11 Wend. 41.),The plaintiff in the judgment, under .which the debtor is imprisoned, cannot maintain an action to enforce an obligation given to secure the judgment. (Sunderland v. Loder, 5 Wend. 58; Wakcenman v. Lyon, 9 id. 241.),AnT. 5.-Discharge. A judgment debtor arrested on execution may be dis. charged on paying the judgment. (Code, Â§ 289, subd. 3.),The officer has no authority, as such, to discharge the defendant on receiving anything but an actual and abso- lute payment of the judgment, in money. (Codwise v. Field, 9 Johns. 263; Mumford v. Armstrong, 4 Cow. 553.) But if the judgment creditor ratifies the act of the officer in taking security in satisfaction, the debtor is discharged. (Armstrong v. Garrow, 6 Cow. 465.),The creditor's attorney has no authority, as such, to discharge the debtor, without payment. (Siimonton v. Barrell, 21 Wend. 362; Kellogg v. Gilbert, 10 Johns. 220; Jackson v. Bartlett, 8 id. 361; see Gor7atn v. Gale, 7 Cow. 739, 744.),The authority of a third person to discharge the debtor without payment, will not be inferred, from doubtful evi- dence. (Crary v. Turner, 6 Johns. 51.) 844
I _ _ Discharge. Its effect. A stay of proceedings does not discharge a debtor arrested on execution. (Sherrill v. Campibell, 21 Wend. 287.),The debtor will not be discharged by the court, pending a motion for a new trial in a subsequent action in which the balance due on the first judgment has been allowed as a set off. (Schroepplel v. Jewell, 1 Cow. 208.),The fact that the debtor wag recaptured in another state, by a sheriff of this state, after a negligent escape from his custody here (Lockwvood v. Mercereau, sp. t., 6 Abb. 206), or that the officer is violating the statute as to the mode of imprisonment (ib.), does not entitle the debtor to his discharge.,The fact that instructions were given to the oflicer, which he has obeyed, to arrest one only of several judgment debtors equally liable to arrest, does not author- ize the discharge of that debtor, if arrested. (akee v. .Edgerton, 5 Duer, 681; 3 Abb. 229.),Lunatic debtor.]-As to the discharge of a debtor on the ground of insanity, see ante, i. 608.,Bffect.]-A voluntary discharge by the judgment credi- tor, of the debtor (Potc7ter v. Holley, 3 Wend. 184; Yates v. Van Rensselaer, 5 Johns. 364; Lathrop v. Briggs, 8 Cow. 171; Goodman v. Chase, 1 Barn. & Aid. 297), or of any one of joint debtors (Ransom v. Keyes, 9 Cow. 128), is by the common law a discharge of the debt, notwithstanding that the creditor did not mean to release the debt (Pouicer v. Holley, 3 Wend. 128); and although the debtor agrees still to be bound, and that another execution may issue (Yates v. Van Rensselaer, supra; Blackburn v. Stupart, 2 East, 243), or agrees to do something, as a condition of the discharge, which he fails to do. (Tanner v. Hague, 7 T. 1. 420.) But if the debtor induces the creditor to,845
Discharge. Its effect. Escape. discharge him, by any fraud, he may be re-arrested. (Bakler v. Ridgway, 2 Bing. 41.),Whenever any debtor has remained charged in execu- tion for thirty days, any creditor at whose suit he is charged may, by a written notice, require the sheriff to discharge him from imprisonment, and thereupon he shall be discharged. Such creditor may have the same civil remedies to enforce payment, as if execution had not issued; but no firther execution against the body can issue on the same judgment. (Laws 1857, ch. 427, 1.),If the debtor is discharged by the court without the creditor's consent, on the ground that he was taken while privileged from arrest (Huiiplhrey v. Oumminig, 5 Weud. 90), or on the ground that no such execution could issue (Ginloc7io v. Figari, 2 Abb. 185; 4 E. D. Smith, 227), or for any irregularity in the proceedings (Merchiant v. Fradnkis, 3 Q. B. 1), a new execution may issue against his person.,ART. 6.-.Escape. If a person taken on execution escapes, he may be re- taken by a new execution against his body; or an execution against his property may issue, in the same manner as if his body had never been taken on execution. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 643; [2 id. 364, Â§ 8].),If the officer permits the debtor to escape, the judgment creditor may cause him to be retaken on a new execution ( Wesson, v. Cltamlberlain, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.] 331; 3Mumlford v. Armstrong, 4 Cow. 553); but the officer has no author- ity to do so, if the creditor has not issued a new execution (T7oinplsoit v. Lockvood, 15 Johns. 256; Lansing v. Fleet, 2 Johns. Cas. 3; Tileiood v. Clement, 6 Dowl. P. 0. 508; Atkinson v. Jameson, 5 T. R. 25), nor even then, if such execution is really issued for the benefit of the offi- cer. (Gillott v. Aston, 2 Dowl. N. S. 413.),As to what constitutes an escape, see ante, i. 595. 846
Supersedeas. In what cases. Motion.,FART. 7.-Supersedeas. In wuhat cases.--If the plaintiff neglects to charge the defendant in execution as required by law (see ante,.p. 841), the defendant.may be discharged from custody by a super- sedeas, unless good cause to the contrary is shown. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 870; [2 id. 556].),When the defendant is in custody at the time judgment is rendered, the three months begin to rtin from the time when the judgment was actually entered, and not from that at which it might have been entered. (Lillpman v. Petersberger, sp. t., 9 Abb. 209; 18 How. 270.),The mere acceptance of an offer to allow judgment to be taken pursuant to Code, Â§ 385, is not obtaining judg- ment within the statute. (Ib.),When the defendant is surrendered after judgment, the three months do not begin to run until the bail have been exonerated also. (Hills v. Lewis, sp. t.i 13 Abb. 101, note.),Motion.l-The motion may be made to any judge of the court in which the judgment was obtained. (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 871; [2 id. 556, Â§ 37.) Thus, the motion may be made to a judge of the first district, although the action is triable elsewhere. (Wells v. Jones, 2 Abb. 20.),Where notice is served of exoneration of bail after judgment, the defendant is entitled to be discharged on a motion for a supersedeas, although no notice of the de- fendant's surrender was served (Wells v. Jones; 2 Abb. 20, 24), but if the motion papers do not show that the bail have been actually exonerated, an allegation that no notice of the surrender has been served on the plaintiff, is, in effect, a denial of such exoneration. (Hills v. Lewis, sp. t., 13 Abb. 101, note.),The fact that the defendant has been charged in execu- tion subsequently to the service of notice of the motion for a supersedeas, may be shown as cause for denying the motion. (Brantingliam's Case, 3 Johns. Cas. 416.),847
Supersedcas. Receiver, when appointed. Effect.]--,After the defendant has been discharged by a supersedeas, he is not liable to be arrested upon any execution issued upon the judgment (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 871; [2 id. '556, Â§ 37]; Masters v. Edwards, 1 Cai. 516), but such execution, if issued, is voidable only. (Reynolds v. Corp, 3 Cai. 267; Reynolds v. Church, id. 274.),CHAPTER CXX. nECEIVER AFTER JUDGMENT. Int w7tat cases.]-A receiver may be appointed, after judgment, to carry the judgment into effect, to dispose of property according to its directions, or to preserve it during the pendency of an appeal, or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied, and the judgment debtor refuses to apply his property in satisfaction of the judg- ment. (Code, Â§ 244.),Corporations.]-WVhen an execution against a corpora- tion has been returned unsatisfied, a receiver of its pro- perty must, on petition of the creditor, be appointed. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 763; [2 id. 463].) Such receivers have all the powers of receivers appointed upon the voluntary dissolution of corporations. (3 R, S. (5th ed.) 763; Laws 1852, ch. 71.),Practice on appoint'nentt.]-The mode of application for, and appointment of, a receiver after judgment, is so entirely similar to the like proceeding before judgment, that we need only refer to what we have already said upon that subject. (Ante, i. 743, 764.) 848
Writ, what. When allowed.,CHUAPTER CXXI. WEVT OF ASSISTANCE. W7tat.]-The writ of assistance is a judicial writ, directing the sheriff or other officer to put some person in possession of real property. It was peculiar to the practice of equity, and was only used for the enforce- ment of equitable judgments.,When allowed.]-This writ may be had to enforce any judgment or order awarding the possession of real pro- perty to a party, other than the common judgment in a direct action for land. Its most frequent use is to put a purchaser under a judgment sale, or a receiver, in pos- session. A purchaser at a sale in pursuance of a judgment (LTynde v. O'Donnell, 12 Abb. 286; 21 How. 34), or his grantee (5 Y. Life & Trust Co. v. Sand, 8 How. 35, 352), is entitled to this writ against all parties to the action, or persons entering under them during the pendency of the action; but not against persons who, being in possession at the commencement of the action, weire not made par- ties (Boynton v. Jackway, 10 Paige, 307; Van Hlook v. Throc7mortoln, 8 Paige, 33), nor their grantees, even pend- ing suit (ib.); nor against persons who enter after the purchaser receives his deed (Betts or Bell v. Birdsall, sp. t., 11 Abb. 222; 19 How. 491), even though they enter under a party to the suit. (Ib.) The writ may issue against a tenant who was made a party to the suit, even though his landlord was not. (Lovett v. German Ref'd Ch., sp. t., 9 How. 220.) A purchaser cannot have a writ of assistance, after he has agreed with the party:in possession to reconvey to him on terms, even though the latter has failed to fulfill the agreement on his part. (Toll v. Hiller, 11 Paige, 228.) How obtained.]-The writ may be granted upon an ex parte application (Lynde v. O'Donnell, 12 Abb. 286; 21,107,U,849
How obtained. Form. How. 34; N. . Life & Trust Co. v. Ranul, 8 How. 35, 352), and, perhaps, without any order of the court. (8 How. 352.),The complicated practice which at one time required a formal order, attachment, execution and injunction, before issuing the writ (Kershawl v. Thompnson, 4 Johns. Oh. 609; Ludlow v. Lansing, Hopk. 231), has long been obsolete. (Valentine v. Teller, Hopk. 422; see Devauccne v. Derau. cene, 1 Edw. Ol. 272; lV. Y. Life Ins. & Trust Co.v. Rand, 8 How. 35.),Formi.]-The writ should clearly identify the property, and should conform to the judgment or order which it is intended to enforce. The rules concerning executions,in this respect, are doubtless applicable to this writ.,The following form is the one which was sanctioned by the Chancellor, modified only by the omission of useless verbiage:,311. Writ of assistance. Slte IËIe Of t de tate st ge Mrst,,TO THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY OF ........

B., Clerk.,s 850
In what cases issuable. When issuable.,CHAPTER CXXI. PRECEPT FOR COSTS. Ill what cases issuable.]-A precept in the nature of an execution against personal property may issue to enforce the payment of interlocutory costs, founded upon an order of the court (Lawts 1847, cot. 390, Â§ 3) directing such pay- ment. ( Weitzel v. Sculltz, sp. t., 3 Abb. 468; Lucas v. John- soil, sp. t., 6 How. 121.),The precept cannot issue to collect the costs of a pro- ceeding not resulting in an order of the court, e. g., costs awarded by a referee in supplementary proceedings. (Hulsaver v. Wiles, 11 How. 446.),The precept can issue only to collect the costs of a motion, strictly so called (Wesley v. Bennett, sp. t., 6 Abb. 12); thus, it cannot issue to collect costs awarded on sus- taning a demurrer to part of an answer (Mora v. Sut Mutual Ins. Co., sp. t., 13 Abb. 304; 22 How. 60); nor on an application for judgment, under Â§ 247 (Wesley v. Bennett, sp. t., 6 Abb. 12); nor on granting absolutely a motion for judgment as in case of a nonsuit. (Carroll v. Frazee, sp. t., 2 How. 93; see Thomas v. Clark, sp. t., 5 id. 375.),The precept may issue to collect costs on the denial of a motion for a new trial, taxed afterwards. (Hougghton v. Gardner, sp. t., 2 HIow. 144; Butzard v. Gross, sp. t., 4 id. 23.),When issuable.]-If the amount of costs to be paid is not specified in the order, a precept cannot issue to collect it until the sum has been liquidated by or under the direc- tion of the court. (Eckerson v. Spoor, sp. t., 4 How. 361.),The precept cannot issue before twenty days after ser- vice of the order (Rule 57, Sup$reme Ct.; see Post v. Haigqlt, ep. t., 2 How. 175), unless otherwise ordered; except where,851
In what cases. Form. costs to be adjusted are to'be paid, in which case the precept may issue after fifteen days from the adjustment of the costs by the clerk, upon notice, unless otherwise ordered. (Rule 57.) In such case, if it is issued before adjustment, it will be set aside for irregularity. (North v. Sargeant, 14 Abb. 223.),The precept may issue without any demand (Laws 1840, c7l. 386, Â§ 15; Lucas v. Johnson, sp. t., 6 How. 121; Mitchel v. Westervelt, id. 265, 311; but see Boyce v. Bates, sp. t., 8 id. 495), or application to the court. (Laws 1840, supra; Herring v. Hallenbeck, sp. t., 1 How. 89; Militchell v. Wes- tervelt, supra; Weitzel v.

Lien acquired by these proceedings. ART. 1.-Of the proceeding in general. A proceeding supplementary to execution has been sometimes spoken of as a special proceeding within the meaning of Â§ 3 of the Code (Conway v. Hitchins, 9 Barb. 378), or as at any rate a proceeding in the nature of a new action, and not a part of the original suit (Allen v. Starring, 26 How. 57; Griffin v. Dominguez, 2 Duer, 65G; Davis v. Turner, sp. t., 4 How. 190); but the better opin- ion is that it is a proceeding in the original action. (Bank of Genesee v. Spencer, 15 How. 412.),The various proceedings treated of in this chapter were designed by the legislature, as substitutes, to a great ex- tent, for a ereditor's suit in equity (Owen v. Dupignac, 9 Abb. 180; Orr's case, sp. t., 2 id. 457; Sale v. Lawson, 4 Sands. 718); and the, rules which governed the practice in such actions should control these proceedings, in so far as they are applicable. (Ib.) The Code does not, however, prohibit a creditor's action, in substantially the old form, whenever it is found necessary to the attainment of justice (HaBnnwnd v. Hudson River Maciine Co., 20 Barb. 378),
In general. What may be thus enforced. although it has been suggested that such an action will not lie where the same purpose might be accom- plished by a supplementary proceeding. (See Taylor v. Persse, sp. t., 15 How. 417.) The correct view, however, is that the remedies by action and by these proceedings are concurrent, and that the control of the court over the costs of the action is a sufficient safeguard against its being unnecessarily resorted to. (Catlin v. Doughty, sp. t., 12 How. 457.),What judgments may be titus enforced.]-A proceeding of this nature may be instituted upon any money judg- ment in. personam of a court of record of this state, whether rendered before or since the Code (Dickerson v. Cookl, 16 Barb. 509; Jones v. Lawlin, 1 Sands. 722; 1 Code Rep. 94), and whether execution was issued thereon before or since. (Ib.*) A judgment against joint debtors may be enforced by these proceedings, even though one of them is not served with process ( Code, Â§ 294 ;t Emery v. Emery, sp. t., 9 How. 130; Jones v. Lawlin, 1 Sands. 722; Code Rep. N. S. 94), and this too against all of them, though only for the purpose of reaching the joint pro- perty of all, and the separate property of those who were served with process. (See Ib.),But we are satisfied that such proceedings cannot be had upon a judgment recovered solely upon a publication of the summons, without an appearance on the part of the defendant. And there are some limitations to the right of proceeding upon the transcript of a justice's judgment, that will be noticed in the proper place.,Interest due on a judgment may be collected by these proceedings, although the principal amount is paid. (Jo7hnt son v. Tuttle, 17 Abb. 311.),Who may institute proceedings.]-Not only the judg- ment creditor of record, but his assignee, may institute,* To the contrary, see Anon. (3 Duer 673). t As amended, 1863. 854
In general. Before return of execution. supplementary proceedings (Hough v. Kohlin, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 232) in the name of the original creditor (Ross v. Clussman, 3 Sands. 376; Code Rep. N. S. 91); and this although the assignment was made after the return of the execution. (Ib.; Qrr's Case, sp. t., 2 Abb. 457.),Rights of third parties.]-Strangers to the action have no right to notice of these proceedings (Corning v. Glen- ville Woolen C., sp. t., 14 Abb. 339), nor to be made par- ties thereto for the protection of any lien or interest they may have; as their rights cannot be affected thereby. (lb.),Different modes of proceeding.]-Three distinct proceed- ings are included under the general title of this chapter. The first, and most common, is a proceeding against the judgment debtor after the return of an execution against him; the second is a proceeding against him before such return; and the third is a proceeding against his debtors to procure the payment to his creditor of such debts.,These proceedings will be considered respectively in the above order. 'ART. 2.-Proceed7ings against the jutdgment debtor after,return of execution. Nature of the proceeding.]-A proceeding under this article is designed to secure to the judgment creditor the right to examine his debtor personally as to what pro- perty he may have, liable to the demand of the creditor, but not reached by the execution. Such a creditor is, in the cases defined by this article, entitled to such an exami- nation of the debtor. (Code, Â§ 292.),On uwhat judgments.]-This proceeding may be had upon the judgment of a court of record, irrespective of its amount (Bennett v. Doodqy, sp. t., N. Y. Trans., Dec. 8, 1860); but not upon a justice's judgment, unless it is for,855
After return of execution. At what time. at least $25, exclusive of costs (Code, Â§ 292; Butts v. Dick. inson, 12 Abb. 60; 20 How. 230; Anon., sp. t., 32 Barb. 201; Yulte v. TY7Titeheed, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 596),* and a trans. cript thereof has been filed with the county clerk. (Code, Â§ 292.),Against w7homi,.]-It is held that these proceedings can- not be instituted against a corporation. (Hinds v. Canan- daigua &c. R. R. Co., 10 How. 487; see Sherwood v. Buffalo & N. Y. R. R. Co., 12 id. 136; .ant7i0monld v. Hudson River Iron Co., sp. t., 11 How. 29.) Of course they may be maintained against any natural person, subject to the jurisdiction of the court; though not against foreign con- suls, &c. (Griifin v. Dominguez, 2 Duer, 656.) Formerly they could not be used against a married woman (Will- iams v. Carroll, 2 Hilt. 438), but this is clearly not the case now. (Thomplson v. Sargent, sp. t., 15 Abb. 452.),At what timle.]-The proceedings here treated of can be taken only after an execution against the property (Code, Â§ 292), both real and personal (Butts v. Dickinson, 12 Abb. 60; 20 How. 230), of the judgment debtor, or of -that one of the debtors (if there are several in the same' judgment), against whom the proceedings are taken, has *been issued to the sheriff of the county in which he resides or has a place of business, or, if he does not reside in the state, to the sheriff of the county where the judg- ment roll or transcript of a justice's judgment is filed, and returned unsatisfied in whole or in part. (Code, Â§ 292.),It is enough to authorize these proceedings that an execution was issued to the county in which at that titme the debtor resided, even though he has since removed to another county, to which no execution was ever issued. (Bingiham v. Disbrow, 14 Abb. 251.) * Overruling Candec v. :Gundelbheimor (Co. Ct., 8 Abb. 435; 17 How. 434). 856
After return of execution. At what time. The meaning of the words "place of business " has not been very clearly defined, but probably includes the place at which the debtor is employed, as clerk or otherwise, as well as a place under his own control. It is not mate- rial to inquire, if the debtor has two places of business, which is his principal location. (MEtwivan v. Burgess, sp. t., 15. Abb. 374.) The fact that the debtor does business in the county, even daily, is not enough, if he has no settled place. (Belicna v. Hasbroulcd, sp. t., 13 Abb. 418.),The execution must be actually returned, before these proceedings can be had (E Sgle v. Bolneau, 2 Sands. 679; 3 Code Rep. 205), but an execution returned at any time during the day on which an order for such a proceeding is obtained in good faith, will sustain the order, even though not returned until after the order was granted. (Jones v. Porter, sp. t., 6 How. 286.),It has been held, in the great majority of reported cases, that these proceedings cannot be sustained upon an exe- cution returned before the expiration of sixty days from its issuance, at the request of the creditor. (Spencer v. Ciyler, 9 Alb. 382; 17 IHow. 157; Nagle v. James, sp. t., 7 Abb. 234; Ritterband v. M'aryatt, sp. t., 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 158; see Pudney v. Grifith7s, sp. t., 6 Abb. 211; 15 How. 410.) But this doctrine has been overruled in a recent case (Sperling v. Levy, 10 Abb. 426), and disap- proved in the Court of Appeals. (Sorbes v. Waller, 25 N. Y 430.) It seems therefore that, unless it appears that the request to return the execution was made in bad faith, or for an improper purpose, supplementary proceedings may be founded upon such a return.,It has long been settled that these proceedings may be taken upon the return of the execution unsatisfied, of the sheriff's own motion, even though sixty days had not expired since it was issued. (Tyler v. Willis or Whitney, 33 Barb. 327; 12 Abb. 465; Farquharsona v. Kimball, sp. t., 18 How. 33; 9 Abb. 385, n.; .Engle v. Bonneau, 2,108,857
After return of execution. Before return. Sands. 679; 3 Code Rep. 205; Livingston v. Cleaveland, 5 How. 396.),The lapse of five years from the entry of judgment is no bar to these proceedings, if the execution was issued within that period. (Miller v. Rossman, sp. t., 15 How. 10.*) No period short of twenty years after the judgment is sufficient to debar the creditor from these proceedings. (Owen v. Dupignac, 9 Abb. 180.),If an appeal has been taken from the judgment, and security given sufficient to stay execution, even after execution has been issued, these proceedings will not be allowed (Ritterband v. Maryatt, sp. t., 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 158); but if they have been commenced before the security was perfected, they should only be suspended, and not dis. missed. (Cowdrey v. Carpenter, 17 Abb. 107.),The issuing of a second execution, if not certain to pro- cure the satisfaction of the debt, is no bar to supple- mentary proceedings under the first. (Farqutharson v. Kimball, sp. t., 18 How. 33; 9 Abb. 385 n.; Sale v. Law son, 4 Sands. 718; Lilliendahl v. Fellernan, sp. t., 11 How. 528; 2 Abb. 155.) ART. 3.-Proceedings against ju(dgment debtor before return,of execution. After the issuing of an execution against property (Code, Â§ 292), both real and personal (see ante, p. 856), and "without waiting for its return (Seeley v. Garrison, 10 Abb. 460), the court or judge may, upon proof that the judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to the satisfaction of the judgment (Code, Â§ 292), and which cannot be seized under the execution (Saceltt v. Newton, 10 How. 560), require him to submit to an examination on this question, on which the same proceed- ings may be had as in the case of a proceeding taken after return of the execution. (Code, Â§ 292.),* Limiting Currie v. boyes (sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 198). 858
Before return of execution. Against third persons. On whattjldymnents.]-It would seem that no proceed- ings of this kind can be had on judgments which cannot be enforced by an execution against realproperty. (See Butts v. Dickinson, 12 Abb. 60; 20 How. 230.),Against wltom.n]-The remarks made ante, p. 856, apply equally to this proceeding.,ART. 4.-Proceedings against third persons. After the issuing of an execution against property, and either before or after its return (Code, Â§ 294, Seeley v. Garrison, 10 Abb. 460), the judge may, upon an affidavit that any person or corporation has property of the debtor against whom execution was issued, or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, require such person or corporation, or any officer or member thereof, to appear and answer concerning the same. (Code, Â§ 294.) If execution has been issued to the county in which the person to be examined resides, that is sufficient, even though no execution has been issued to the county in which the judgment debtor resides. (People v. Norton, 4 Sands. 640.) These proceedings cannot be entertained after the death of the judgment debtor. (Hasewell v. Penman, sp. t., 2 Abb. 230; 13 How. 114.) It has been'held in several cases that this proceeding can only be taken in aid of a proceeding directly against the debtor under Â§.292, and cannot be resorted to without such a proceeding being had (lord v. Ford, 15 Abb. 409 n.; Sherwood v. Buffalo and N. Y. B. R. Co., 12 How. 136; Hasecell v. Penman, sp. t., 2 Abb. 230; 13 How. 114); but the later cases are to the contrary (Holmes v. Jordan, 15 Abb. 410 n.; Parker v. Hunt, sp. t., ib.; see McBride v. Farmers' Bank, 28 Barb. 476; 7 Abb. 347; Poster v. Prince, 8 Abb. 407; 18 How. 258), and, as we think, properly so.,859
Against third persons. Who may grant order. It has also been held that these proceedings cannot be taken under an execution against the property of a cor- poration (Shlerwood v. Buffalo & N. Y. R, B. Co., 12 How. 136), and though the propriety of this decision has been doubted, and the doctrine limited to domestic cor-' porations (McBride v. Farmers' BanCk, 28 Barb. 476; 7 Abb. 347), and those not municipal (Lowber v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 5 Abb. 268; 7 id. 248), it does not appear to have been directly overruled.,Who may be examined.]-It has lately been held that the wife of the judgment debtor may be examined under Â§ 294, as a third party within the meaning of that section. (Loc7cwood v. Worstell, sp. t., 15 Abb. 430 n.) This ruling is directly opposed to a former decision at general term (Andrews v. Arelson, 7 Abb. 3 n.); but is, we suppose, founded upon the theory that the wife is in such case, a party to the proceeding, in which case recent amend- ments to the Code have superseded the doctrine of Andrews v. Nelson.,An officer of court, having custody as such of a fund, is neither a person nor a corporation in his special capacity. He cannot, therefore, be examined under Â§ 294 in relation to such fund. (Anon., sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 211.),ART. 5.-Who mnay grant the order. Any of the orders mentioned in this chapter may be granted by a judge of the court in which the judgment was obtained (Code, Â§ 292,-294), no matter where residing. (Bing7lam v. Disbrow, 14 Abb. 251.),In a proceeding against the debtor, after the return of the execution, where a general examination is sought, the county judge of the county to which the execution was issued may grant the order. (Code, Â§ 292.) The court, as such, has no jurisdiction over such a proceeding. (Bitting v Vandenburgh, 17 How. 80.) 860 o
Who may grant the order. Vihat ji'dgcs. In a proceeding after the issuing of an execution to compel the debtor to apply property to the satisfaction of the judgment (under subd. 2 of Â§ 292, and art. 3 of this chaptcr), the court in which the judgment was recovered, or a judge thereof, or a county judge, residing in the same county with the debtor, may make the order. (Code, Â§ 292.) It is not entirely clear, but we think that proceedings under Â§ 294 should be taken before the same judge, but not before the court. The only matter of doubt is whether they should be had before the judge of the county in which the debtor resides, or of that to which the execution was issued. Where both of these conditions concur, there is no difficulty. Where they do not, it will be best to apply, if possible, to a judge of the court in which the judgment was entered.,In the city of New York any judge of the Court of Com- mon Pleas may act as a county judge in any of these pro- ceedings. (Code, Â§ 292.),It appears to us that every officer clothed with the powers of a justice of the Supreme Court at chambers has jurisdiction to grant stlch orders, in like manner, at the least, with a county judge. There is a decision to the con- trary (Cus71Zsman v. Johnson, sp. t., 4 Abb. 256; 13 How. 495), but, in the main, that case has been overruled by the court of last resort (see Hayner v. James, 17 N. Y. 316), and the distinction between the two cases is not clear enough to save it. For a list of the officers clothed with such powers, see ante, i. 275.,The recorders of Troy and Oswego are expressly empowered to take cognizance of supplementary pro- ceedings in like manner with county judges. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 323, 344.) A judge of the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over any of these proceedings under a judgment of any other court (Blaike v. Locy, sp. t., 6 How. 108; Stright v. Vose, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 79 i.); except upon its being made to,861
Who may grant the order. The application. appear to his satisfaction, by affidavit, that the county judge before whom such proceeding should, in the ordi. nary course of things, be brought, is incapacitated from acting therein, in which case any such justice may act in his stead. (Code, Â§ 292.),ART. 6.-The application. Notice.]-The application for any of the various orders for supplementary proceedings may be, and always is, made ex parte (Goodall v. Demarest, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 534), even when the debtor has been examined once before. (l b.),The judge may, in his discretion, require a notice of a proceeding under Â§ 294 (art. 4 of this chapter) to be given to any party to the action, in such manner as he may deem proper (Code, Â§ 294); and in general, such notice should be required (Gibson v. Haggerty, 15 Abb. 406; 23 How. 260; Ward v. Beebe, sp. t., id. 372); but no party, not even the judgment debtor, is entitled to such notice as matter of right. (Seeley v. Garrison, 10 Abb. 460; foster v. Prince, 8 id. 407; 18 How. 258.),The affidavit.]-The application must be made upon an affidavit of the necessary facts (Code, Â§ 292, 294), which may (Conway v. Hitchins, 9 Barb. 378), and in general should, be made by the creditor himself, or by some one having personal knowledge of the facts.,The affidavit must state every material fact necessary to give the judge jurisdiction, or the proceedings taken thereon will be void. (People v. Hulburt, 5 How.. 446; Code Rep. N. S. 75.) It must expressly state that an execution has been issued against the property of the debtor (People v. Hulburt, supra),t and must correctly * The dictum to the contrary in Orr's case (sp. t., 2 Abb. 457), should not be followed.,t M'Arthur v. Lansburgh (Bp. t, Code Rep. N. S. 211), to the contrary, must be considered as overruled. 862

Weed, sp. t., 10 Abb. 62.),In a proceeding upon the transcript of a justice's judg- ment, if the amount of the judgment is stated at a figure which exceeds by $25 the highest amount of costs which could possibly be allowed in the justice's court, the affi- davit need not aver that it was "for $25, exclusive of costs" (Whitlock's case, sp. t., 1 Abb. 320); but in a case less clear, it must be so stated. o If the application is made by an assignee, the affidavit must aver the fact of the assignment to him. (Frederick v. Decker, sp. t., 18 How. 96; Lindsay v. Sherman, sp. t., 5 id. 308.) If the debtor has been already examined in a similar proceeding under the same judgment, the affidavit must mention the fact, and assign a good reason for re- quiring a second examination (Griffin v. Redfield, genl. t., 1st dist., Sept., 1864; Goodall v. Demarest, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 534), and in default of such avermenlts, a second proceed- ing must be dismissed. (lb.),If the execution under which the application is made was issued more than five years after the entry of judg- mcnt, the affidavit must show that leave was given by the court for the issue thereof. (Belktapl v. Hasbrouck, sp. t., 13 Abb. 418.),In a proceeding under art. 2 of this chapter (Code, Â§ 292, subd. 1), the affidavit must not only allege the entry of the judgment and the issuing of the execution, but also that it was returned unsatisfied. (BelkUap v. Has- broitck, sp. t., 13 Abb. 418.) But it need not allege that the debtor has any property. (Hatchl v. Weybturn, 8 How. 163; Anon., 3 Saudf' 725; Code Rep. N. S. 113; Hough v. lKolin, sp. t., id. 232.) In a proceeding under art. 3 (Code, Â§ 292, subd. 2), the affidavit must expressly aver that the debtor "has pro- perty which he unjustly refuses to apply to the satisfaction of the judgment" (Code, Â§ 292; see People v. Recorder of,863

One of the alternatives pre- sented by the Code must be distinctly adopted. (Lee v. ieirbeirger, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 38; see lPeople v. Recorder of Albany, 6 Hill, 429.),313.

Order.]-The attendance of the person to be examined is required by a written order, signed by the judge. (See Code, % 292, 294.) The order must specify a time and place at which the person is to attend before the judge himself (Code, %Q 292, 296), or a referee (id. Â§ 296), in the county to which the execution was issued, if the proceeding is against the debtor under art. 2 of this chapter (Code, Â§ 292, subd. 1), and in other cases in the county in which the person examined resides. (See Ile'senlheimn v. looper, 1 Duer, 594.) When a third person is to be examined, under Â§ 294 of the Code, the order should provide for his examination in the county of his residence, without regard to the resi- dence of the judgment debtor. (Foster v. Prince, 8 Abb. 407; 18 How. 258.),If the proceeding is to be regarded as independent of the action in which the judgment was recovered (see ante, p. 853), the order must have a fifty cent revenue stlamp. But our impression is that it need not be stamped.,The various proceedings authorized by the title of the Code relating to supplementary proceedings, may all be combined, in case of need, by a single order. (Hulsaver v. Wiles, 11 How. 446.) .Injunction.]-The order may include an injunction against any transfer of, or interference with the property,109,865
The order. Injunction. Form of order. of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution. (Code, Â§ 298.)' No other facts appear to be necessary, to sustain an injunction, than are required to sustain a common order. (See Green v. Bullard, sp. t., 8 How. 313.) This injunction is not subject to the rules prescribed by the Code concerning injunctions pending suit. (Ib.) It can- not be granted against a stranger to the action, except in connection with a proceeding under Â§ 294 of the Code. (King v. Tuska, 1 Duer, 635.),An injunction of this nature does not, and can not, affect the right of the debtor to dispose of property ac- quired subsequently to the date of the original order for examination. (Potter v. Low, sp. t., 16 How. 549; see Caton v. Southwell, 13 Barb. 335.) It does not prohibit a simple confession of judgment in favor of a third person, but if the debtor executes such a confession, and delays the supplementary proceedings with intent to enable the creditor in the confessed judgment to seize property which would otherwise have passed to the creditor in these pro- ceedings, that is a breach of the injunction. (Ross v. Clussman, 3 Sands. 676; Code Rep. N. S. 91.) Doubtless it does not affect the debtor's control over money earned by means of his personal services within the preceding sixty days, and necessary for the support of his family.

Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge may, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise to his satisfaction, that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state or concealing himself, and that there is reason to believe he has property which he unjustly'refuses to apply to such judgment, issue a war- rant requiring the sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such judge. (Code, Â§ 292.),This.warrant, it has been held, can be issued by a jus- tice of the court in which the judgment was rendered,: in any county, whether execution has been issued thereto,,867
Warrant of arrest. Service of the order. or the debtor resides therein, or not. (Wilson v. Andrews, sp. t., 9 How. 39.),The affidavit on which application is made for such a warrant must state the facts which justify an apprehen- sion of the debtor's departure, or which show his conceal- ment, or give reason to believe that he has property. For forms and illustrations, reference may be made to the chapters on arrest and attachment, in the first volume of this work. ',Upon being brought before the judge, he may be exa- mined on oath, and, if it then appears that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state, and that he has property which he has unjustly refused to apply to such judgment, he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, with one or more sureties, that he will from time to time attend before the judge as he shall direct, and that he will not during the pendency of the proceedings dispose of any portion of his property, not exempt from execution. (Code, Â§ 292.),In default of entering into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison by warrant of the judge, as for a contempt. (lb.),ART. 9.-Service of the order. The order must be served upon the person required to attend, personally. (See Code, Â§ 418; People v. lHulburt, 5 Hlow. 446.) Any order after the first may be served in the manner prescribed by Â§ 409. (Jo7hnson v. Ttttle, 17 Abb. 315.),'t is not necessary to serve with the order a copy of the affidavits upon which it was granted (Utica Batnk v. Buell, sp. t., 9 Abb. 385; 17 How. 498; Parqulharson v. TKii- ball, sp. t., 18 How. 33; 9 Abb. 385 n.; Grecn v. Bullard, sp. t., 8 How. 313), though it has been suggested that slich a requirement would be proper to be enforced by rule of court. (Utica Bank v. Buell, supra.) 868
Warrant of arrest. ' Vacating proceedings. Any person may serve the order. If it is served by the sheriff, his certificate will not be sufficient proof of service. He must make an affidavit of the fact. (Utica Bank v. Buell, supra.),ART. 10.--acating or staying proceedings. Vacating order.]-If. the order for supplemlentary pro- ceedings has been improperly granted, it may be vacated on motion of the debtor at the time appointed for exami- nation. without notice (Courtois v. Harrison, 1 Hilt. 109; 3 Abb. 96; 12 How. 359); and it may be vacated without notice at any time by the judge who granted it ex parte (Code, Â§ 324); but only upon notice, by any other judge. (Ib.),The irregularity or injustice of the judgment is no ground of objection to the order (O'Neil v. Martin, 1 E. D. Smith, 404; Saunders v. Hall, 2 Abb. 418); and as the irregularity of an execution cannot be objected in a creditor's action (Sandford v. Sinclair, 8 Paige, 373), it would seem that it cannot in these proceedings.,The fact that the creditor has issued an attachment against the judgment debtor, under the Revised Statutes, is no reason for setting aside proceedings previously taken against a debtor of the judgment debtor, under Â§ 294 of the Code. (Hanlson v. Tripler, 3 Sands. 733; Code Rep. N. S. 154.) But a discharge in insolvency subsequent to the judg ment is a good ground for thils motion (Smith v. Patl, sp. t., 20 How. 97), nor will the court, on this motion, inquire into the validity of the discharge, except upon jurisdictional questions. (lb.),Staying proceedings.]-lto judge, other than the one who granted the order, can stay these proceedings. (Bank; of Genesee v. Spencer, 15 How. 14.),When the judgment debtor has appealed from the judg- ment, and given sufficient security to stay execution,,869
Reference. The examination. even after a supplementary order has been 'obtained, the proceedings should be suspended (Cowdrey v. Carpenter, 17 Abb. 107; Ritterband v. Maryatt, sp. t., 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 158), but not dismissed. (Cowzdrey v. Carpeiter, supra.),ART. 11.-Reference. The judge may, in his discretion, order a reference of the proceeding to a referee agreed upon by the parties, or appointed by him, to report the evidence or the facts. (Code, Â§ 300, 296.) Such reference may be directed either in the original order, or at any subsequent time. (Id.),The judges do not, in general, order a reference of such cases unless there are special reasons for so doing, or unless all parties consent. (Hollister v. Spafford, 3 Sands. 742; Code Rep. N. S. 120.) In the New York Common Pleas, however, a special rule prevails in supplementary proceedings upon the judgments of the marine and dis- trict courts; such proceedings are always referred. (Hough v. .Kohlin, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 232.) In the same court there is an official list of referees, for supplementary pro ceedings.,The course of practice under such an order of reference, so far as it is not peculiar to these proceedings, is des- cribed, ante, i. 749. In so far as it is peculiar to them, it corresponds with an examination before a judge, an account of which is given in the next article.,As the referee is appointed to report the facts or the evidence, as the case may be, but not any conclusions of law, it seems to be necessary that his report should be submitted to the court upon a motion for such action as may be proper thereon.,ART. 12.-TTe examination. At the time appointed by the order, the debtor or other person summoned must attend for examination. If the judge or creditor is not present at the precise time appointed, the debtor must wait a reasonable time for 870
The examination. his arrival (Reynolds v. McEllone, 20 How. 454), and the same allowance is made, in practice, in favor of the debtor. One hour is the period of grace established by usage in such cases. If he has any objections to make to the mode of service or the form of the order, he should raise them at the outset, before answering questions (Arctic Ins. Co. v. Hicks, 7 Abb. 204); for, by appearing and submitting to examination without objection, he waives all defects in the service of the order (see Green v. Bullard, sp. t., 8 How. 313), oF in the order itself. (Hobart or Viburt v. Frost, 5 Duer, 672; 3 Abb. 119.),If the judgment creditor fails to attend at the time appointed in the order, or by subsequent adjournment, the whole proceeding falls to the ground at that point. (Squire v. Young, 1 Bosw. 690.),All examinations under this chapter must be taken under the oath of the person testifying. (Coide, Â§ 296.),No one can be excused from answering any question under this chapter on the ground that his examination will tend to convict him of a fraud, or that he has, before such examination, made any transfer of his property for any purpose (Code, Â§ 292); but his answer cannot be used against him in any criminal proceeding. (Ib.),Of the debtor.]-Tlhe judgment debtor may be examined in the same manner as a witness (Code, Â§ 292); and he has a right to be cross-examined on his own behalf (Leroy v. Halsey, 1 Duer, 589; Code Rep. N. S. 275),* and to make explanations or corrections of his testimony (ib.; Corning v. Tooker, sp. t., 5 How. 16); but such corrections should be made by way of additional matter and not by cancel- ing or altering the text of what has already been taken down. (Corning v. Tooker, supra.),He cannot be required to answer any questions which do not tend to show whether he is or is not in possession,*See contra, Corning v. booker (sp. t., 5 How. 16).,871
The examination. Of the debtor. Of other persons. of, or entitled to, property which ought to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment. (Hunt v. Enoch, sp. t., 6 Abb. 212; see Van Wyck v. Bradley, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 157; Wicker v. Dresser, sp. t., 14 How. 465.) He must answer questions concerning property which he has trans. ferred, as well as concerning that which is still in his hands. (Code, Â§ 292.*),The creditor may not only inquire what property the debtor has of his own, but also what he holds under any . pretense-the nature of the title, the terms upon which he holds it, &c. (see LeRoy v. Halsey, 1 Duer, 589; Code Rep. N. S. 275), and also as to the property which he formerly had, and how, when, and for what consideration he parted with it. (Ib.) The debtor cannot avoid further inquiry by swearing that he has no property not exempt from execution, or by any equivalent statement. He must state, with particularity, the nature, quantity and value of such property as lie has. (Brown v. M'organ, 3 Edw. Chi. 278.),Of third plersons.]-The debtor of a judgment debtor, summoned under Â§ 294, cannot be compelled to answer any inquiries concerning property to which he claims title (1'omplkins Co. Bank v. Trallp, sp. t., 21 How. 17; People v. Hutburt, 5 How. 446), except so far as to show when the property came into his hands, whether he claims ab- solute title or only a lien, and if the latter, the extent of the lien. (Barculows v. Protection Co., sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 72.),Of witnesses.]-Witnesses may be required to appear and testify in like manner as upon a trial. (Code, Â§ 295.) There is no authority, however, for issuing a commission,*As amended, 1863, confirming the doctrine of Clapp v. ,athrop (23 Hlow. 423), and overruling that of Ibwn v. Safeguard Ins. Co. (sp. t., 4 Bosw. 683). 872
The examination. 'What may be reached. to examine witnesses in these proceedings. (Grahiam v. Colburnl, sp. t., 14 How. 52.) The creditor may, if he pleases, refuse to examine the debtor at all, though summoned for that purpose, and confine himself to the testimony of witnesses as a foun- dation for such order as he may desire. (Graves v. Lakte, sp. t., 12 How. 33.) There is, however, no doubt that, under Â§ 399, the debtor might testify on his own behalf in such a proceeding, so that no special advantage can now be gained by such a course.,A person summoned only as a witness, and not as a party under Â§ 294, cannot be excused from answering questions concerning property of the judgment debtor, by claiming to own it himself. (Clapp v. Lathrop, 23 How. 423; Sandbfrd v. Carr, sp. t., 2 Abb. 462; but see contra, Yan tWyckl v. Bradley, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 157; Town v. Safeguard Ins. Co., sp. t., 4 Bosw. 683.),Counsel.]-A mere witness is not entitled to appear by counsel, or to take part in the proceedings. (Corning v. Tooker, sp. t., 5 How. 16.) A party to the proceedings, whether a judgment debtor summoned under Â§ 292, or a third person summoned under Â§ 294, is of course entitled to do so.,Adjoiurnmem.te.]--No adjournment can be ordered without the consent of the person examined. (Semble, People v. Htrlbii.t, 5 How. 446; but see Allen v. Starring, 26 How. 57.) With such consent, any number of adjournments may be made. An adjournment by consent of the debtor's attorney in his absence is binding upon him. (Parker v. Hunt, sp. t., 15 Abb. 410 n.) ' On an adjourned examination, the debtor is not to be resworn, and may properly refuse to renew his oath. (Hudson v. Plets, 11 Paige, 180.),Re-opening.]-After the examination has once been closed, it cannot be re-opened, without a special order of,110,9 873
What may be reached. What cannot. the court or judge. (Orr's case, sp. t., 2 Abb. 457; Hudson v. Plets, 11 Paige, 180.),ART. 13.-Wliatl roperty may ble reac7ted. All the property of the debtor, not specially exempted by law from execution, may be reached by means of these proceedings (Code, Â§ 297), whether in the debtor's own hands, or in those of any other person, or due to him (id.), unless he supports a family in whole or in part by his labor, in which case his earnings for personal ser- vices, at any time within sixty days next preceding the order (id.) for the application of his property to the pay- ment of his debt (Butsh v. Wiite, sp. t., 12 Abb. 21) can- not be reached, if it is made to appear, by the debtor's affidavit or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of such family. (Code, Â§ 297.),Property exempt by the law of this state cannot be reached in these proceedings, even though situated in another state. (Btunt v. Fonda, 2 Code Rep. 70.),The housekeeper of an unmarried man, and her child- ren, do not constitute a family within the meaning of this provision, even though he has undertaken to support them in consideration of the mother's services. (Val Vechlten v. Ball, sp. t., 14 How. 430.) Where it appeared that the debtor, though he had a wife and children living with him, did not in any degree contribute to their sup- port, it was held that he could not avail himself of this provision. (Martin v. Sheridan, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 586.),Nothing acquired by the debtor after the service of the original order for examination can be reached by any of these proceedings. (Caton v. Souttwell, 13 Barb. 335; Pot ter v. Low, sp. t., 16 How. 549; Campbell v. Foster, sp. t, id. 275; see Sands v. Roberts, sp. t., 8 Abb. 343.) And if a gross sum is payable to the debtor from, any person, in consideration of services not wholly performed at the time of such service of the order, no part of such sum can be touched under that proceeding. (Brownling v. Bet 874
What may be reached. Orders concerning property. tis, 8 Paige, 568.) But if the debtor receives a salary, payable at stated times, for continuing services, an in- stallment filling due before the commencement of the proceeding may be reached. (See ib.) No claim of the debtor can be reached that is not actually due (MTCor- mic7i v. Kehtoe, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 184), unless, the whole consideration having been given on the part of the debtor, payment is agreed to be made in installments, when it seems that the entire claim can be taken by the judgment creditor. (Ten Broeck v. Sloo, sp. t., 2 Abb. 234; 13 How. 28.) A right of action for a breach of contract is property that can be reached (Ten Broeck v. Sloo, sp. t., 2 Abb. 234; 13 How. 28); though a claim for a mere personal injury is not (see ib.; Davenport v. Ludlow, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 66; Hudson v. Plets, 11 Paige, 180), nor a claim for injury to property exempt from execution. (Hludson v. Plets, supra.),These proceedings cannot reach property leviable under the execution, but upon which no attempt was made to levy, and which, before the return of the execu- tion, were assigned by the debtor. (Watrous v. Lathrop, 4 Saudf. 700.),Taxes raised by a municipal corporation for purposes specified by law, and in the hands of its officers, cannot be reached under supplementary proceedings upon a judgment founded on a claim of a different nature from those for which the taxes were levied. (Loaber v. Mayor of N. Y., sp. t., 7 Abb. 248.),ART. 14.-Orders concerning property. The judge may order any property within the scope of the last article of this chapter to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment. (Code, 3 297.),This order may be made in the absence of the debtor, in case of his failure to appear, either upon the original,875
-_- Orders concerning property. Conflicting claims. order, or at any subsequent period of the proceedings. (See Edmonston v. M'Loud, 16 N. Y. 543.),The judge or court before whom any of these proceed. ings are had, has no power to determine conflicting claims to property, or to adjudge that anything is due to the judgment debtor from a person denying the claim (Code, Â§ 299; Rodman v. Henry, 17 N. Y. 482; People v. King, 9 How. 97; People v. Hulburt, 5 id. 446), even though such person is a receiver under appointment by the court, and claiming as receiver under a prior appoint- ment (Genet v. Foster, 18 How. 50); nor to decide that property in the hands of the debtor, which he asserts to belong to another person, belongs to the debtor, in the absence of such person (Roldman v. .Henry, gupra), nor even if such person is made a party to the proceeding. (Teller v. Randall, 40 Barb. 242 ; 26 How. 155.) But the judge may, by order, forbid any transfer of or incum- brance upon any property thus in dispute, until the receiver appointed in the proceedings has had suflicient opportunity to sue for and recover the same. (Code, Â§ 299.) Such order may be modified or dissolved by the judge granting it, at any time, on such security as le may direct. (Id.),No order can be granted to compel the debtor to deliver property which does not clearly appear to be under his control (Sandford v. Mosh ier, 13 How. 137); and if he has parted with property under a secret trust, the fact of the trust must be very clearly established to warrant the interference of the judge (Hall v. M'lMahon, sp. t., 10 Abb. 203), which is even then of doubtful propriety (lb.), since, as we have already seen, no order could be made against the third party in possession.,No order can be made for the transfer of an income out of a trust fund, payable periodically to the debtor. Such an income can be reached only by an action. (Stec- art v. Foster, 1 Hilt. 505; Scott v. Nevius, sp. t., 6 Duer, 672.) 876

(Code, Â§ 302.) If it is not fit to be thus enforced, it is not fit to be made at all. An order requiring a third person to deliver up pro- perty belonging to the debtor may be enforced in like,877
Orders concerning property. Receiver.,------ ---- manner (Code, Â§ 302); but it may well be doubted whether an order to pay a debt due to the judgment debtor ought ever to be thus enforced. Certainly it will not be, if the person required to pay returns that he is not able to do so, and the creditor cannot prove that he is. (Peters v. Kerr, sp. t., 22 How. 3; see Patten v. Conna7t, 13 Abb. 418; Code, Â§ 302.),No action will lie upon such an order, in favor of the creditor, against the person required to pay to him the debt due to the judgment debtor. (Patten v. Conntai, 13 Abb. 418.),ART. 15.- Receirer. The judge may, by order, appoint a receiver of the pro- perty of the judgment debtor, in the same manner and with the 'ike authority as if the appointment was made by the court, under Â§ 244 of the Code. (Code, Â§ 298.),WTlto may alppoinlt.]-No judge has jurisdiction to appoint a receiver except the one who granted tile original order. (Smith v. Johnson, sp. t., 7 How. 39.),In what cases.]-A receiver can be appointed only in a proceeding against the debtor, and not in a proceeding merely under Â§ 294. (Darrowt v. Lee, 16 Abb. 215; iekmp v. Harding, 4 How. 178; Dorr v. Noxon, sp. t., 5 id. 29.),The creditor may have a receiver appointed, even though no property has been disclosed by the examina- tion. (Myers' case, sp. t., 2 Abb. 476; Fitzburgli. v. Ever- ilnlqamj, G Paige, 29; Bloodlood v. Clark, 4 id. 574; see Webb v. Overmann, sp. t., 6 Abl. 92.) No injustice can be done to the debtor by this means, since the creditor will have to pay the costs himself, if no property is found. (Ib.),Nor is it any objection to the appointment of a receiver, that the only property disclosed is such as might be levied upon by execution. (Bailey v. Lane, 15 Abb. 373 n.) 878
O,879 Receiver. Notice. Who may be appointed. If the judge who appoints the receiver is one who could legally take cognizance of the matter on a proper appli- cation, the appointment, if made in the presence of the debtor, and without prompt objection on his part to the mode in which he was summoned to attend, is valid, even though the order requiring his attendance was defective. (Bingllam v. Disbrow, 14 Abb. 251; Hobart or Viburt v. Frost, 5 Duer, 672; 3 Abb. 119.),Notice to creditors.]-3Before appointing a receiver, the judge must ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of the party, or otherwise, whether any other supplementary proceedings are pending against the judgment debtor; and if such is the case, the creditor prosecuting the same must be notified to appear before such judge, and is also entitled to notice of all subsequent proceedings in relation to the receivership. (Code, Â§ 298.) But such creditor is not entitled to service of a copy of the examinations taken in the proceeding. (Todd v. Crooke, 4 Sands. 694.),A creditor wli l is not conducting supplementary pro- ceedings is not entitled to any notice of the proceedings of another creditor. (Corning v. Glenville Woolen Co., sp. t., 14 Abb. 339.),Who may be appointed.]-No more than one receiver of the property of a judgment debtor can be appointed (Code, Â§ 298), and, therefore, if one has been appointed in any such proceeding, the same one must be appointed in every subsequent proceeding. (Myrickv v. Selden, 36 Barb. 15.) When a reference is ordered for the purpose of appointing a receiver, the one so appointed takes pre- cedence of one appointed in another action, subsequently to the date of the order of reference, though prior to the actual selection of the receiver under the same. (Demiing v. N. Y. Marble Co., sp. t., 12 Abb. 66; see lRttter v. Tallis, 5 Sands. 610.)

That the said judgment debtor deliver to the said receiver all money and other property now in his possession, except property exempt from execution [and excepting also his earnings during the sixty days preceding the date hereof.],[Date.] [Judge's signature.] Filing order.]-Every order for the appointment of a receiver in supplementary proceeding s must be filed with the clerk of the county in which the judgment roll, or transcript of a justice's judgment, upon which the pro- ceedings were taken, is filed. (Code, Â§ 298.*) If the debtor owns any real property, it is necessary 'that a certified copy of the order should also be filed and recorded in the clerk's office of the county in which such real property is situated, and in that of the county in which such debtor resides. (C'ode, Â§ 298.t) Such clerk must record such orders in a book kept specially for that purpose, and note the time of filing therein.

* Receiver. Acquirement of title by. ment as first before mentioned. (Code, Â§ 298.#) His real property passes to the receiver only when all the require- ments before mentioned are complied with. (Id.t),An annuity in the hands of trustees, payable to the debtor under a will, for his support, and not alienable by him, does not pass to the receiver. An action is neces- sary to determine how much of the annuity is required for the support of the debtor. (Genet v. Foster, 18 How. 50.) An annuity which tll debtor can transfer, does, however, pass to the receiver. (De Grato v. Clason, 11 Paige, 136; see Ten Broecl v. Sloo, sp. t., 2 Abb. 234; 13 How. 28.) No assignment from the debtor to the receiver is neces- sary to pass title to his property, whether personal (Porter v. Willianis, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 142; 12 How. 107; People v. Hulburt, 5 IIow. 446; West v. Fraser, 5 Sands. 653) or real. (Porter v. Williams, supra.s) No order of seques- tration is necessary or proper. (West v. Fraser, 5 Sands. 653.),There seems to be no authority in the judge or court to require the debtor to execute any assignment to the receiver (see People v. Illblurt, 5 How. 446; Ten Broeck v. Sloo, sp. t., 2 Abb. 234; 13 How. 28), unless he has property out of the State. Such property, whether real or personal, he may be compelled to assign. (Fenner v. San- born, 37 Barb. 610; see Bulnn v. Fonda, 2 Code Rep. 70.) The title of a receiver, appointed under an order of reference to appoint, dates from the time at which the order was granted. (TrVal AJstyne v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489; Rutter v. Tallis, 5 Sands. 610.) *As amended, 18G2. tAs amended, 1863. t The case of Chautauque Co. lank v. Risley (19 N. Y. 369, 374) is often cited as overruling Porter v. Williams. It does nothing of the kind. The ease arose before the enactment of the Code, and the language of the court refers only to the old practice. This error misled the court in MJoak v. Coats (33 Barb. 498), which case is therefore of no authority.,111,881
Receiver. Creditor's lien. It seems that an order may be made requiring the debtor to deliver his property to the receiver; but, if no such order has been made, the debtor cannot be punished for refusing to do so. (Watson v. ltitssimnlons, 5 Duer, 629.),Powers of receiver.]-A receiver appointed in a proceed. ing of this kind has all the powers of a receiver under Â§ 244. (Code, Â§ 298.) As to these powers, see ante, i. 766. Special powers are conferred upon him, unless otherwise expressly ordered by the court, by Rule 92 (ante, i. 214).,He represents not only the debtor, but also the creditors (ante, i. 765, 766), and can therefore maintain an action to set aside a conveyance by 'the debtor as fraudulent. (Porter v. Williams, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 142; 12 id. 107.*),Control of court over receiver.]-A receiver appointed in these proceedings is subject to the direction and control of the court in which the judgment was rendered, unless it was rendered in a justice's court, in whicl case lie is subject to the county court of the county in which the transcript is filed. (Code, Â§ 298.),ART. 16.-Lien acquired under these proceedings. There is no doubt that a judgment creditor proceeding against his debtor under this chapter acquires an equitable lien upon the property passing under such proceedings to a receiver appointed therein. (Porter v. Williams, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] -142, 152; 12 How. 107.) Neither is there any doubt that, unless a receiver is appointed, the creditor acquires no lien or priority by means of these proceed- ings. (Edmonston v. 3PLoued, 16 N. Y. 543.),It has, however, on the one handl, been held that the lien thus acquired dated only from the actual appoint, *Overruling Seymour v. Wilson (16 Barb. 294); Iayner v. Fowler (ii 300). 882
Lien acquired under these proceedings. ment of the receiver (Voorhies v. Seymour, 26 Barb. 569; Conger v. Sands, sp. t., 19 How. 8), while, on the other hand, there are dicta of high authority to the effect that the lien dates back to the service of the original order for examination of the debtor. (Porter v. Williams, sp. t., 5 How. 441; asf'd, 12 id. 107; 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 142; see .Edmonston v. McLoud, 16 N. Y. 543.) The latter doctrine strikes us as being decidedly most accordant with equita- ble principles. But Fan Alstyne v. Cook, (25 N. Y. 489) is, perhaps, a decisive authority to the contrary. The receirer is, however, deemed appointed from the time at which an order of reference for his appointment is granted. (Ante, p. 881.)

An appeal is a proceeding by which the judgment or order of a court or judge is brought before a higher tribunal for review.,At cmmon law, such review was obtained by a writ of error or of certiorari, according to circumstances. In equity, the remedy was by appeal. Writs of error, in civil actions, are abolished, and the Code has adopted in name the equitable proceeding. (Code, Â§ 323.) An appeal
Nature of the proceeding. Who may appeal. under the Code is not, however, governed entirely by the rules of equity, but by a fusion of legal and equitable rules, applied according to the justice of the case. (See grifin v. Mauaquardt, 17 N. Y. 28.) In appeals which are clearly substituted for writs of error, as upon appeals from inferior common law courts to the Supreme Court, the practice upon writs of error is adopted, in so far as'it is not expressly superseded by the Code. (Tlhurber v. Townsend, 22 N. Y. 517.),ART. 2.-TVhl7o may appeal. Party aggrieved.]--Ainy party aggrieved may appeal, in the cases prescribed by law. (Code, Â§ 325.),Any one of several persons being parties, even upon the same side, may maintain an appeal, without the con- currence of his co-parties. (Mfaattison v. Jones, sp. t., 9 How. 152; see Girald v. Beach & Stagg, 4 E. D. Smith, 27; 10 Howv. 369.),Only a party.]-No one can appeal who is not a party on the record (Re Bristol, 16 Abb. 397; E. v. B. C. B., 28 Barb. 299; 8 Abb. 44; Martin v Kanouese, 2 Abb. 390), except a purchaser at a judicial sale, who is re- garded as a party to the action. (Delaplaine v. Lawrence, 10 Paige, 602; Bailey v. 3Â£aule, 7 Clark & Fin. 121 1i.; see lrortimer v. Nash, 17 Abb. 229 n.),Before even the personal representatives of a deceased party can appeal, they certainly ought to be substituted in his place on the record (Beach v. Gregory, sp. t., 2 Abb. 203; Miller v. Gunn, sp. t., 7 HIow. 159), and we think must be.,Only party aggrieved.]-Nor can even a party appeal, if he is not aggrieved by the decision, that is, if he has no interest prejudiced thereby. (Foster v. Prince, 8 Abb. 407; Idley v. Bowen [Ct. of Errors], 11 Wend. 227; Reid v. Van- derheylden [Ct. of Errors], 5 Cow. 719; Kelly v. Israel, 11 Paige, 147; Huglies v. Sticekey, 13 Wend. 280; see Fair-,885
Who may appeal. What is appealable. banks v. Corlies, 3 E. D. Smith, 582; 1 Abb. 150), and even though he was aggrieved by it when it was made, yet if he has since lost his interest in the subject of the action, he cannot appeal. (Mills v. Hoag, 7 Paige, 18; Cusack v. Gilbert, 5 Bro. P. 0. 471; see Reid v. Valnder7leyden, supra.),Decision in favor of appellant.]-The party in whosa favor a decision is made, may appeal therefrom, if it is not as favorable to him as he claims that it should be (Parker v. Newland, 1 Hill, 87), but not otherwise, for then he could not be aggrieved.,Poor persone.]-It has usually been held, that an appel- lant cannot be allowed to prosecute his appeal as a poor person, under the statute. (Ostrander v. Harper, sp. t., 14 How. 16; see Bolton v. Gardner, 3 Paige, 273; Moore v. Cooley, 2 Hill, 412.) The Court of Errors did, however, on one occasion, allgw an appeal to be thus conducted. (Whelan v. Whelan, 3 Cow. 537, 554.),ART. 3.-What is lapealable. We cannot do more, in this place, than state some general considerations, applicable equally to judgments and orders, and to appeals in every stage. A detailed account of appealable decisions will be found elsewhere.,Matters in discretion,]-A decision on a point which it is within the discretion of the court to determine as it pleases, is not appealable (Briggs v. Vandenlburgh, 22 N. Y. 467; Rogers v. Holly [Ct. of Errors], 18 Wend. 350; Rowley v. Van Benthitysen [Ct. of Errors], 16 id. 369; Moore v. Moore, 14 Barb. 27; see If.. . Cent. R. R. v. Marvin, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 279); provided the court exer- cises its discretion, for if it denies an application on the ground of want of power to grant it, an appeal will lie from such decision. (Russell v. Conn, 20 N. Y. 81; McEl- wain v. Corning, 12 Abb. 16; Beach v. Chamberlain, 3 Wend. 366.) So an appeal will lie from any decision 886
Wiat is appealable. Matters in discretion. Costs. made as a matter of strict right, and not in the exercise of the judge's discretion, even though he has such discre- tion. (Afcefaholn v. Mutual Ben. Life Ins. Co. 12 Abb. 28; Artisan's Banik v. Treadwell, 34 Barb. 553.) A palpable abuse of judicial discretion (see Plato v. Kelly, 16 Abb. 188), or a clear mistake, which the judge declines, or is unable (see Fields v. Afoul, 15 Abb. 6), to correct, is a good ground for appeal.,Costs.]-A decree is not the less appealable, merely because it affects only the costs of an action. (M'Gregor v. Comstocl, 19 N. Y. 581.) There are numerous cases in which it is said that no appeal will lie upon a mere ques- tion of cQsts (Sherman v. Daggett [Ct. of Appeals] 3 How. 426; Rogers v. Holly, 18 Wend. 350; Eastblurn v. Kirk, 2' Johns. Clh. 317; see Travis v. Waters, 12 Johns. 500; and other cases), but those were cases in which costs were in the discretion of the court below. An appeal will lie on a mere question of costs, where they are a matter of right, and are awarded to the wrong party (see Rogers v. Holly, supra; Decker v. Gardiner, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 29), or where, being discretionary with the court, as between the parties, they are charged against a person not a party. (Lord Advocate v. Dunglas, 9 Clark & Finl. 173.),Void judlgment.]-A judgment or order, void for want of jurisdiction in the court, may be appealed from and reversed. (Gormnly v. .M'Intosh, 22 Barb. 271.*) This can- not, however, be done at the instance of the party who induced the court to assume jurisdiction. (Fairbaniks v. Corlies, 1 Abb. 150; 3 E. D. ilith, 582.) Default.]-A decision rendered by. a colurt of record, upon default of the appellant, is not appealable. (Irving * Compare lfalone v. Clarlh(2 Hill, 657); Randal v. Iall (Hill & D. Supp. 239); Edlwards v. Russell (21 Wend. 63); Striker v. Molt (6 Wend. 465) ; Lamoure v. Caryl (4 Den. 370).,887

Oaks, 2Q Johns. 282.t) As to cases arising.in a justice's court, see post, chap. cxxix.,Consent.]-A judgment or order entered by consent is not appealable (Boyd v. Bigelow, 14 How. 511; see Yiee v. Troy & Boston I. R., 21 Barb. 381; Â¥an IWormer v. Mayor of Albany, 18 Wend. 169; O'Dotugerlty v. Aldrich, 5 Denio, 385; Toder v. Sansam, 1 Bro. P. C. 468), even though it is stipulated between the parties that it may be appealed firom. (Jarvis v. Palmer, 1 Barb. Ch. 379.),A judgment being rendered on demurrer, with leave to amend on payment of costs, and then judgment for costs being entered by stipulation as ground of appeal, the appeal was dismissed. (Perkins v. Farnlham, 10 How. 120.),Mlere opinion.]-A mere expression of opinion, however decided, if not embodied in the form of a judgment or order, is not appealable. (Slyder v. Beyer, 3 E. D. Smith, 235; see Pierret v. M1oler, id. 574.),ART. 4.-W- aiver of appeal. The right of appeal may be waived, either by express agreement, or by a course of action which makes it unfair that the appellant should be allowed to proceed.,Therefore a stipulation between the parties that the decision shall be final, precludes an appeal therefrom. (Townseld v. Masterton Stone Co., 15 N. Y. 587.),And where the appellant voluntarily proceeds under the decision, he waives his appeal (Ubsdell v. Root, 3 Abb.,* These cases were all in the Court of Errors. t In Dutch Church, &c., v. Wood (8 Barb. 421), such a judgment, and in Wilkinson v. Tiffany (4 Abb. 98), such an order was reversed. 888
Waiver of appeal. Time to nppe-'. 142; Vail v. Remsen, 7 Paige, 206), especially if he accepts a positive benefit under the decree. (Bloom v. Kelly, 17 Abb. 229; Vail v. Remlsen, supra; Radlway v. Graham, 4 Abb. 468.) Even an appeal fiom one part of a decree is waived by enforcing another part of it, if its nature is such that both parts would have to be reversed in case the appeal should be sustained. (Benliett v. Fan Syc7e7l, 18 N. Y. 481.) So the right of appeal is lost, where, after a decision against the appellant, embodying leave to amend or plead anew, he does so amend or plead (Brady v. Donnelly, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 126), or where leave has been obtained to amend, upon a separate appli- cation (iM'JElivai v. Willis, [Ct. of Errors], 9 Wend. 548), and this, even though the terms imposed are so onerous that the appellant does not wish to avail himself of such leave. (lb.) So where he renews his application under leave embodied in the order of which lie complains (Noble v. Prescott, 4 E. D. Smith, 139), or under leave granted on a special motion (Peel v. Elliott, 16 How. 483); or where the order grants a favor to the adverse party upon pay- ment of costs, &c., which the appellant accepts. (Radway v. Graham, 4 Abb. 468; Lewis v. Irving Fire Ins. Co., 15 Abb. 140 ii.),The mere acceptance, by the appellant, of money or other property due to him under the decree, does not de- prive him of the right to appeal therefrom. (Clowes v. Dietenson [Ct. of Errors], 8 Cow. 328; Higbie v. Westlale, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 281.) And on the other hand the pay- ment of the sum required by the decree (unless by way of compromise) does not affect the payer's right to appeal (Wells v. Danforth [Ct. of Appeals], Code Rep. N. S. 415; Burch v. Newbury, 4 How. 145.),ART. 5.-Time to appeal.

Time to appeal When too early. When too late. appellant is not obliged to wait for notice of the judgment or order in any case.,When too early.]-No appeal can be taken from a judg. ment of a court of record until it is perfected by the filing of the judgment roll (SPlMahoin v. Harrison [Ct. of Ap. peals], 5 How. 360; Lenttilhon v. Mayor of iVY., 3 Sands, 721; Code Rep. N. S. 111; M'lMathon v. Allen, 7 Abb. 1); nor from an order, until it is entered with the clerk (Marshall v. Francisco, 10 How. 147; Smith v. Dodd, 3 E. D. Smith, 215; see Pierret v. Moller, id. 574); nor per. haps even then, if any question remains in abeyance. (See Sherman v. Wells, 14 How. 522, 527.),But in this, as in other cases, fractions of a day are not regarded, unless for the purpose of preventing injustice. Therefore an appeal taken before the judgment roll is actually filed, but upon the same day, is not premature. (Blydenbulrygl v. Cotheal, 4 N Y. [4 Comst.] 418; 5 How. 200.),An appeal may be taken from a justice's judgment immediately upon its rendition, without waiting until it is docketed. (Griswiold v. ant Deusen, 2 E. D. Smith, 17s.),When too late.]-No appeal can be taken from the judg- ment of any court to another court, after the lapse of two years from the filing of the judgment roll. (Code, Â§ 331.*),No appeal can be taken to the Court of Appeals from an order made before judgment (including orders granting or refusing a new trial), after the lapse of sixty days from the time that written notice of such order has been given to the appellant. (Code, Â§ 331.),No appeal can be taken from a judgment or order of a special term or a judge, to the general term of the same,* Formerly, such an appeal must have been taken within two years " ate judgment." Some decisions under this form of the statute are now obsolete. (See Forrest v. Forret, 25 N. Y. 501.) 890
Time to appeal. When too late. court, after the lapse of thirty days from the service of written notice thereof upon the appellant. (Code, Â§ 332.) Appeals to the Court of Appeals from an order made in an action after judgment, or in a special proceeding, and appeals to the Supreme Court from an order of a county court or judge, cannot be taken after the lapse of two years from filing the judgment roll. (Code, Â§ 331.) Such is the language of the Code, from an evident over- sight on the part of successive legislatures which have added these classes of appeals to the chapters referred to in Â§ 331. The only reasonable interpretation of that section in this respect seems to be that the two years run from the actual entry of these orders.,As to the mode in which notice of a judgment or order must be given, in order to limit the time to appeal, con- sult carefully chap. cx., art. 7, ante, p. 714. When notice of a judgment or order is served by mail, the party thus served has double the usual time within which to appeal. (Dorlon v. Lewis, 7 How. 132.) An appeal from a justice's court (see chap. cxxix., post) must be taken within twenty days after judgment, irrespec- tive of any notice thereof; unless the defendant was not personally served with process in the action, in which case he has twenty (days after personal notice of the judgment. (Code, Â§ 353.),Last day Sunt7tay.]-If the last day for appealing falls on Sunday, the appeal must be taken on Saturday. (Pea- cock v. Segina, 4 0. B. [N. S.] 257; but see Campbell v. International Ins. Co., 4 Bosw. 298.),Enljargement of time.]-There is no doubt that the time allowed for an appeal cannot be enlarged by a judge out of court (Code, Â§ 405); and the weight of authority denies such power even to the court itself (Fry v. Bennett, 7,891

Chamberlin, 11 N. y. [1 Kern.] 274); though there are cases to the contrary. (Toll v. Thomas, sp. t., 18 How. 324; Haase v. A. y. Central R. R. Co. sp. t., 14 id. 430; Crittenden v. Adams, sp. t., 5 id. 310; Seely v. Pritchard, 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 245.),It is further held that the time to appeal cannot be extended by indirect means, as by an amendment njr v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385; Enos v. Thonmas, 5 How. 361; Peo1ple v. Eldridge, sp. t., 7 How. 108), or by setting aside a judgment for the mere purpose of ena- bling an appeal to be taken from it as re-entered. (Marston v. Johnson, 13 How. 93; see Hlumphrey v. Chamberlin, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 274.) Relief has, however, been granted in the latter form under extreme circumstances. (Jclliinglhaus v. N. Y. Ins. Co., 5 Bosw. 678; see Church v. 7Rhodes, sp. t., 6 How. 281.) A motion to set aside a judgment as irregular does not prevent the running of the time allowed for an appeal. (Renonil v. Harris, 2 Sands. 641; 2 Code Rep. 71.),Objections, hozo raised.]-The objection that an appeal was brought too late, can be raised only upon a motion to dismiss the appeal. (Mills v. Shuit, 2 E. D. Smith, 139.) This is also the proper mode of raising the objection that the appeal was brought too early; but it frequently hap- pens that this fact makes it impossible for the court to proceed, even after an argument upon the merits, and it is thus compelled to dismiss the appeal of its own motion. It cannot, however, afford any reason for affirming the decree below. * Overruling Seely v. Pritchard, in the same court (12 N. Y. Leg. Ob. 245; 3 Duer, 669). t See the authority of this case denied by HARRIS, J. (18 How. 324). 892
Notice of appeal. Form of notice.,ART. 6.-Notice of appeal. The Code prescribes a method in which appeals are to be taken, which is of uniform application to all appeals except those taken from justices' courts. Those are governed by peculiar rules (see post, chap. cxxix.), and this article does not, therefore, apply to them. An appeal can be made only by the service of a written notice of appeal in the manner herein stated. (Code, Â§ 327.) Form of notice.]-The notice of appeal must be in writing (CÃ³ode, Q 327), and must state that the appeal is taken from the judgment, or from some specified part thereof. (Ib.) It has been said that it ought, in strict- ness, to state either that it is from "the whole judglment" or from a specified part thereof (People v. Tarbell, sp. t., 17 How. 120); but a notice of appeal "from the judg- ment" is practically sufficient as an appeal from the whole. (Ib) It need not state the grounds of appeal, or the ob- jections raised (Wilson v. Allen, 3 How. 369); though it has been said that it would be better practice to do so. (Smith v. Grant, 17 How. 381.) On an appeal from an inferior court to the Supreme Court, it is not essential that the notice should state that it is taken to the general term. That is implied as a matter of course. (People v. Tarbell, sp. t., 17 How. 120.) A notice of appeal from a judgment on a verdict will not cover an appeal from an order denying a new trial. (Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 How. 385; M'larqtart v. Lafarge, 5 Duer, 559; Hastings v. M'Kiinley, 3 Code Rep. 10.) But there is no authority for the assertion of Mr Whittaker, in his Practice (vol. ii. 716), that intermediate orders necessarily affecting the judgment must be ex- pressly mentioned in the notice of appeal to warrant their reviewal. Service of a case containing exceptions has been held equivalent to service of a notice of appeal, unless imme-,893

PFassitt, 33 Barb. 645; 12 Abb. 281; 21 How. 279); or as at any rate sufficient to sustain au amendment adding a formal notice 1ntnc pro tune. (I7.) This ruling has, however, been dis .approved in a later case. (Salls v. Butler, 27 How. 133.),The notice should be entitled as in the court in which judgment was rendered, and not in the appellate court.,Â§ 320. Notice of allpeal.

De Bow, 5 How. 114) for tlhe adverse party, and on the clerk with whom the judlgment or order appealed from is entered. (Code, Â§ 327.),The notice to the adverse party may be served by mail, and if properly deposited in the post office before the lapse of the time to apl)eal, it is immaterial at what time it is delivered (Crittentde)n v. Adams, sp. t., 5 How. 310); but the notice to the clerk must be actually delivered at his office within the period allowed for an appeal. (Ib.),Until the service of this notice on both the party and the clerk, there is no appeal in existence. (1Westcott. Platt, 1 Code Rep. 100; People v. Elldridge, sp. t., 7 Iow. 108; Crittenden v. Adams, sp. t., 5 How. 310.) 894
I ------------------- security for costs. Nature and form.,ART. 7.-Security for costs on alppea(l. Wh7en necessarg.]--No appeal can be made to the Court of Appeals, nor to the Supreme Court from any other court, without giving security, as described in this arti- cle (Code, Â§ 334, 345; and a notice of appeal in such a case, unaccompanied by the proper security, is wholly void (Kelsey v. Canmpbell, 38 Barb. 238; see Kitchting v. Diel1, sp. t., 40 Bairb. 233), except in the case of an appeal by the people (Laws 1858, c7i. 37), or by a municipal cor- poration (ante, i. 124; Laws 1859, ch. 262), on whose part no security is required. And in all cases this security may be waived by a written consent on the part of the respond- ent. (Code, Â§ 334.) And even without any written agree- ment security is waived by omitting to raise the objection in a reasonable time, and treating the appeal 'as in exis- tence. (Leentilho) v. iMayor of N Y., 3 Sands. 721.),No security is required upon any appeal from one branch of a court to the general term of the same court. (Davis v. Diffie, 8 Bosw. 691; lIalsey v. Flint, 15 Abb. 367; Kitching v. Dicbl, sp. t., 40 Barb. 233; Dorlon v. Lewis, 7 How. 132; Ten Broeck v. Hudsont River R1. R., id. 137; Parsons v. Suydam, sp. t., 4 Abb. 134;* see Boyd v. Bigelow, 14 How. 511.),N*atutre and form of security.]-This security must be given in the form of an undertaking, in writing, executed by at least two sureties, to the effect that the appellant will pay all costs and damages which may be awarded against him on the appeal, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars; or that sum must be deposited with the clerk with whom the judgmenlt r order was entered, to abide the event of the appeal. (Code, Â§ 334.) * To the same eftcet as to appeals fiom orders only, under the original Code, are Beach v. Soutihworth (6 Barb. 173); Allen v. Johnson (2 Sands. 629); and other cases. The Code of 1851 put judgments upon the' same footing.,895
Security for costs. Nature and form. An undertaking is sufficient if it secures to the respond. ent the substance of his rights. It is not essential that it should be strictly conformable to the statute. (Foster v. Foster, 7 Paige, 48; see Smith v. Norval, 2 Code Rep). 14.) If, therefore, it is given for a larger amount than the law requires, it is valid. (Re Easterbrooks, 5 Cow. 27.),An undertaking to pay all "damages" awarded, but omitting the word " costs," is not sufficient. (Langley v. IWarner, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 606; 3 How. 363.),On an appeal from two or more orders in the same action, security to the extent of $250 is not sufficient (Scheierertorn v. Anderson, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 430; 2 Code Rep. 2); and on such security the appeal will not be sustained as to any one of the orders, even though the others. prove to be not appealable. (I7.) But where two orders have been unnecessarily made, one including the entire substance of the other, only a single appeal and single security are necessary. (Gregory v. Dodge, 3 Paige, 90.) It is of course needless to say that twojudg- ments cannot be appealed from upon single security. But an appeal from a single judgment requires only single security, although it may contain two or more distinct awards in favor of different parties. (Smith v. Lynes, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 569; 4 How. 209.) Thus if a judgment awards $500 to one party, and $1,000 to another, an appeal from both branches of the decree needs only $250 security (ib.), and this, too, although the respondents have always appeared by separate attorneys, so as to be entitled to separate bills of costs.

It is of course always desirable, on the part of the appellant, to procure a stay of all proceedings on behalf of the respondent, until the decision of the appeal. The methods by which this result may be obtained are various, and as they cannot be classified in precisely the same order as the general subject of appeals, we prefer to treat of them all in this place.,The subject may be divided into three branches, viz.. 1. Appeals from judgments; 2. Appeals from orders, to another court; 3. Appeals from orders, to the general term. The first of these classes may further be subdi- vided into appeals from judgments; (1.) for money; (2.) for the sale or possession of real property; (3.) for the assign- ment or delivery of personal property; (4.) for the execu- tion of a written instrument.,113,897
Stay of proceedings. Money judgmcnts.

Lecaritt, 1 Abb. 274; 10 How. 481), does not stay the exe- cution of such judgment, unless a written undertaking is executed on the part of the appellant, by at least two sureties, to the effect that if the judgmlent appealed from, or any part thereof, is affirmed, or the appeal dismissed, the appellant will pay the amount directed to be paid by the judgment, or by so much thereo' as may be affirmed, if it is affirmed only in part, and all damages awarded against him on the appeal.

(Code, Â§ 337.),Al)peals fromi other judgments.]-O n an appeal from any other judgment than those above mentioned, proceedings in the court below (Code, Â§ 342), that is, in all the courts below (Anon., 3 Code Rep. 69), are stayed without other security than is necessary to perfect the appeal.

(Code, Â§ 342.),A judgment recting the payment of money out of a fund in court is within the scope of Â§ 342, and proceed- ings thereon are stayed by an appeal duly perfected. (Curtis v. Leavitt, 1 Abb. 274; 10 How. 481.) The same rule applies to a judgment for an injunction. (Ifolce v. Searing, sp. t., 6 Bosw. 684; 11 Abb. 28.),App2eals from o rders to another coturt.]-On an appeal to the Court of Appeals from an order in a court below, pro- ceedings are, we think, stayed by virtue of Â§ 342 of the Code, as soon as the appeal is perfected by filing the necessary security under Â§ 334. (See Grisiold v. Fowler, sp. t., 15 Abb. 368 n.) The language of Â§ 342 is not, however, clear, not referring in express terms to orders, though it professes to cover all cases not included in Â§t 335 to 339, which certainly relate only to judgments. In Tiers v. Carnaltan, (sp. t., 3 Abb. 309), it was said that there was no statutory provision for staying proceedings on appeals to the Court of Appeals from orders, but Â§ 342 was not noticed, and the decision is sustainable on other grounds. If we are wrong in our con- struction of this section, and it applies only to judgments, this class of appeals come under the same head as appeals to ageneral term from orders in the same court at special term, and proceedings can only be stayed in the same way.,Appeals from orders to general term of samne coulrt.]-On an appeal from an order to the general term of the same court in which the order was made, the only mode of stay- ing proceedings under such order is by obtaining a special order of the court for such stay.,The appeal does not stay proceedings of its own force (Hicksv v. Snith, 4 Abb. 285; Bacon v. .Reading, 1 Duer, 622; Genin v. Chadsey, sp. t., 12 Abb. 69; Ferry v. Bakic of V. Y., sp. t., 9 Abb. 100; Johnson v. Scriver, sp. t., 3,901

IWhite, sp. t., 8 How. 275),* nor will the mere deposit of security without an order of the court, effect a stay. (See Sorbes v. Oaks, sp. t., 2 Abb. 120.),Orders of this nature are usually conditioned upon the filing of the adequate security, in the same manner as upon an appeal from a judgment. (See Genin v. Chadlsey, sp. t., 12 Abb. 69; Jo7losojn v. Scriver, sp. t., 3 Abb. 208.) In Rogers v. McLveatn (sp. t., 10 Abb. 458), the court, in consideration of the disadvantage to which the respondent would be put by a complete stay, granted a partial stay without any security, leaving the greater part of the order appealed from, in force.,Â§ 325.

(Waring v. Ayres, sp. t., 12 Abb. 112.) This is a,* To the contrary were Emerson v. Burney (sp. t., G How. 32); Cook v. Pomeroy (sp. t., 10 How. 103). See also Trustees of Penn Yan v.

Stay of proceedings. Security for costs. Exceptional cases. matter of course on an appeal to the Court of Appeals, or to the Supreme Court from any other court (Langley v. Warner, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 606; 3 How. 363; Kelsey v. Campbell, 38 Barb. 238; see Newton v. Harris, sp. t., 8 Barb. 306; Code elep. N. S. 191; People v. Tarbell, sp. t., 17 How. 120), and as, under Â§ 348, an appeal from a judgment of the special term to a general term will not stay proceedings unless security is given as upon an appeal to the Court of Appeals, it is equally necessary in such cases. (Traring v. Ayres, sp. t., 12 Abb. 112; Hoppock v, Cottrell, sp. t., 13 How. 461; Wilson v. Allen, 3 How. 369; see Sternhtaus v. Sclhmlidt, sp. t., 5 Abb. 66.) Thus, on an appeal from a judgment directing the execution of an instrument, the deposit of such instrument with the clerk will not stay proceedings without security for the costs. (Wariny v. Ayres, supra.),Exceptional cases.]-On an appeal by the people, or by any state officer or board of officers, from any judgment or order in any court, all proceedings thereon are stayed, without any security being given. (Laws 1861, ch. 288; amending Liaws 1858, ch. 37.) The statute does not make any express mention of orders, but we think that they should be deemed to be included under the word "judg- ment." If not, the court unquestionably ought to, and will, direct proceedings upon an order adverse to the people to be stayed, on an appeal being taken by them, without security.,Proceedings are in like manner stayed by an appeal on the part of a municipal corporation from any judg- ment or decree (which includes, we presume, an order), without security, unless required by order of the court in which such judgment, &c., was rendered. (Ante, i. 124; Laws 1859, ch. 262.),When security may be reduced or dispensed with.]-The court from which the appeal is taken may, in its discre-,903
Stay of proceedings. Dispensing with security. Notice. tion, dispense with or limit the amount of the security required, where the appellant is an executor, administra- tor, trustee; or person otherwise acting in the right of another (Code, Â§ 339), except where such security consists in the execution of a written instrument, and its deposit with the clerk. (Id.) The court will almost always reduce the pecuniary security required from such parties to the amount of assets in their hands. (See Mills v. Sorbes, sp. t., 12 How. 466.),The same court may, in its discretion, limit the security required from other parties, upon any judgment other than for money, to an amount not less than $50,000, where it would otherwise exceed that sum. (Id.),On an appeal from a judgment at special term to the general term of the same court, the court or a judge thereof may in any case reduce the amount of security required to any extent, or dispense with it altogether, upon such terms as may be just. (Code, Â§ 348.) No court has power to do this on an appeal from one court to another. (Watt v. Watt, sp. t., 15 Abb. 367 n.) On an appeal from a judgment for the delivery of personal property, such as will depreciate by time and use, it would not be just to stay proceedings upon a simple undertaking to obey the order of the appellate court, without indemnity against the depreciation and loss of use of the property. (Read v. Potter, sp. t., 11 Abb. 413.),Notice of security.]-All that is said, ante, p. 897, respect- ing service of a copy of the undertaking, or hjLc_? of deposit, is equally applicable to securities given to stay proceedings. Such copy or notice cannot be served, with any effect, after service of the notice of appeal. (See post p. 908.) .,Insufficient security.]-Of course, an undertaking- is- sufficient in amount, or in form, will not stay proceedings on the part of the respondent. 904
Stay of proceedings. Effect of stay. It has been said that such an undertaking is wholly void and does not bind the sureties therein, at any rate, if disregarded by the respondent. (See Halsey v. Flint, 15 Abb. 367.),Effect of stay of proceedings.]-The effect of the stay here provided for is to stay all further proceedings in the court below upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter embraced therein (Code, Â§ 339); but the court below may proceed upon any other matter included in the action tion, and not affected by the judgment appealed from. (Id.) An appeal from a judgment for an injunction suspends all proceedings for the punishment of a breach thereof (Howe v. Searing, sp. t., 6 Bosw. 684; 11 Abb. 28), leaving the appellant liable to punishment, in case of an affirm- ance of the judgment, for the breaches of which he has meanwhile been guilty. (Ib.),A stay of proceedings upon appeal has no retrospective effect, but simply stops proceedings just where it finds them, taking away no right already acquired, and avoid- ing no act already done. (Be Berry, 26 Barb. 55; see Cowdrey v. Carpenter, 17 Abb. 107.) A stay on appeal from a judgment does not supersede an execution pre- viously issued thereon, nor discharge a levy made there- under. (Re Berry, 26 Barb. 55; Cook v. Dickerson, 1 Duer, 679; Stricker v. Wakeman, sp. t., 13 Abb. 85; Rath- bone v. Morris, sp. t., 9 id. 213; Clark v. Clark, 7 Paige, 607; see Burr v. Burr, 10 Paige, 166.) On appeal from an order discharging a provisional remedy, a stay of pro- cecdings does not revive such remedy. (Hart v. Mayor of Aba.,y, 3 Paige, 381; Wood v. Diwight, 7 Johns. Oh. 205; Hoyt v. Gelston, 13 Johns. 139.) So an appeal from an order refusing to vacate a judgment does not stay pro- eedi.ng on; the judgment. (Tiers v. Carnalan, sp. t., 3 Abb. 69.),The court may, in its discretion, and by virtue of its general control over its own process, direct the sheriff to,114
Stay of proceedings. Effect of stay. discharge property from a levy made before proceedings were stayed (Stricker v. Wakleman, sp. t., 13 Abb. 85; Clark v. Clark, 7 Paige, 607),* and this should be done whenever the security is unquestionable. (Ib.) But pro. perty taken under an attachment cannot be released after judgment. (Spenlcer v. Rogers Locomotive Works, sp. t., 13 Abb. 180.),Where a judgment of reversal contains in itself a direction for restitution, proceedings under such direc- tion are stayed by the usual security to stay proceedings under the judgment (Britton v. Phillips, 16 Abb. 33); though if a distinct order for restitution is made, after judgment, proceedings thereon could only be stayed by an order. (See ib.),An appeal from an order granting a favor to the appel- lant does not enlarge the time within which such favor may be taken advantage of. (Ferry v. Bank of Central N. Y., sp. t., 9 Abb. 100.) This is so, even where pro- ceedings are stayed by the appeal. (Ib.),It is only proceedings in the action that are stayed. An independent proceeding, even though founded upon some matter involved in the action, or arising out of it, is not affected by the stay. Thus, after a judgment awarding an office to the plaintiff, an appeal staying proceedings does not preclude a summary proceeding under the sta- tute, for the possession of the papers of such office. (Welch v. Cook, sp. t., 7 How. 282.) And an action may be brought upon an undertaking given in another action, notwithstanding a stay of proceedings in the latter (Bur- rall v. Vanderbilt, 1 Bosw. 637; 6 Abb. 70); except where such an undertaking was given upon an appeal from a judgment to the general term of the same court, in which case, if an appeal is taken to the Court of Appeals in such manner as to stay proceedings, no action may be,* Rathbone v. AMorri (sp. t, 9 Abb. 213), is to the contrary, but is, e think, erroneous. 906
Stay of proceedings. General rules concerning securities. commenced or recovery had on such undertaking until after the final determination of such appeal. (Code, Â§ 348.*),Filing a transcript of the judgment is not a proceeding in the action, and such a step may therefore be taken after the stay is perfected (Bulklcey v. Keteltas, 3 Sands. 740; Code Rep. N. S. 119); though the transcript itself could not be issued while proceedings were stayed. (See ib.) In general it may be stated that no proceedings are stayed which are not clearly and unequivocally covered by the terms of the order, if any. (Weeks v. Smith, sp. t., 3 Abb. 211.) ART. 9.-General rules concerning securities on appeal. Security may be by undertaking or deposit.]-In every case in which an undertaking is required, a deposit of the amount in court, in money, may be made in lieu thereof. (Code, Â§ 335.*),Wlho nay execute uzndertalking.]-An undertaking may be executed by sureties alone, without the appellant's joining in it. (See ante, i. 576.),The attorney for the appellant is not disqualified as a surety. (Studivell v. Palmer, 5 Paige, 57; see Eyckcman v. Coleman, sp. t., 13 Abb. 398.) Form of undertaking.]-Though undertakings under the Code are usually in a simple form and without seal, yet they are valid if under seal, and in the form of a penal bond. (Episcopal Church v. Varian, 28 Barb. 644; Conklin v. Dllher, 5 How. 386; Wilson v. Allen, 3 id. 369.) They must, in all substantial matters, follow the text of the Code, not restraining payment by any other conditions than those prescribed by law. An undertaking, for ex- '*A amended, 1862. *As amended, 1.863.,907

Blanchard, 3 '. .Y. [3 Oomst.] 335; Seacord v. Morgan, 17 How. 394; Slack v. Heath, 4 E. D. Smith, 95; 1 Abb. 331), nor that the sureties should, in fact, receive any. (Livingston v. HanL. mer, 7 Bosw. 670.),An undertaking must always be proved or acknow- ledged in like manner with a deed of real estate, before it can be received or filed. (Rtle 6, Supreme Ct.),Notice of security, wthe and how given.l]-The appellant must serve upon the respondent, at the same time with the notice of appeal, a copy of the undertakings given, if any, including the names and residences of the sureties; or, if a deposit has been made, notice of such deposit must at that time be given. (Code, Â§ 340.) If such copy or notice is not served with the notice of appeal, the undertaking or deposit is wholly unavailing. It cannot be served afterwards, without leave of the court. (Smith v. Heermance, sp. t., 18 How. 261; Cushman v. Martin, sp. t., 13 id. 402; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Pro. Ins. Co., sp. t., 10 id. 344.),Justification of sureties.]-An undertaking of any kind upon appeal is of no effect, unless accompanied by the affidavit of the sureties that they are each worth double the amount specified therein. (Code, Â§ 341.),It has been held that even where the amount specified in the undertaking is unnecessarily large, the sureties must each justify in double such amount; and that a justification in less will be insufficient, notwithstanding it may be in double the amount which the undertaking ought to have specified. (People v. Tarbell, sp. t., 17 How. 120.) But we must say that this seems to us an over strict construction of the Code. Of course, where two or,-- - - _ 908
(eneral rules concerning securities. Justification of sureties. more undertakings are consolidated into one, the justifi- cation must be in double the aggregate amount, including the $250 required for costs. (Sternhtans v. Schmidt, sp. t., 5 Abb. 66; Hoppock v. Cottrell, sp. t., 13 How. 461; see Sills v. Tlhrs7by, No. 8, 11 How. 129.) Notwithstanding this affidavit, the respondent may, within ten days after notice of the appeal, except to the sufficiency of the sureties; and unless they justify before a judge of the court below, or a county judge, in the manner prescribed in the case of bail upon arrest (see ante, i. 584-589), within ten days thereafter, and upon a notice to the respondent of not less than five days, the appeal is regarded as if no undertaking had been given. (Code, Â§ 341.) The respondent's time to except does not begin to run until the undertaking is filed, as well as a copy served. (Webster v. Steplhes, 5 Duer, 682; 3 Abb. 227.) Unless the notice of exception is served by mail, it will be rarely safe to serve notice of justification in that way, inasmuch as a notice so served must be given at least ten days before the justification, while the ten days allowed for the performance thereof are not extended. (Dresser v. Brooks [Ct. of Appeals], 5 How. 75.) If the respondent does not attend at the time and1 place specified for justification, the sureties need not justify; and their absence at the same time does not prejudice the undertaking. (Ballard v. Ballard, 18 N. Y. 491.) If, the sureties not being approved, the appellant is allowed further lime to furnish new sureties, such sureties must justify on notice without a fresh exception, or the security will be void. (Chamberlain v. Demnsey, sp. t., 13 Abb. 421; 22 lHow. 356.) An exception to the undertaking will not require the sureties to justify. (Young v. Colby, 2 Code Rep. 68.) Filing.]-Every undertaking given on appeal must be filed with the clerk with whom the judgment or order appealed from was entered. (Code, Â§ 343.),909
General rules concerning securities. RcnewaL It has been said (Smith v. Heermance, sp. t., 18 How. 261; Cushkman v. Martine, sp. t., 13 id. 402; Webster v. Stephens, 5 Duer, 682; 3 Abb. 227), that the under. taking mutst be filed at the same time with the notice of appeal. But though it is undoubtedly better that this should be done, we do not see that it is made void by an omission to do so, as in the case of a failure to serve a copy with the notice.,Loss of deposit.]--A deposit, made in lieu of an under- taking, is at the risk of the appellant, not of the respon- dent. If lost without the fault of either party, its amount cannot be deducted from the judgment, in case of an affirmance thereof. (Parsons v. Travis, 5 Duer, 650.) And if a deed executed by the appellant in obedience to the judgment, and deposited as security, is lost, he must exe- cute a new one, in case of an affirmance of the judgment. (Worrall v. Muttn, 17 N. Y. 475.),Renewal of security.]-On an appeal from a judgment directing the payment of money by a party (see ante,). 898), if an undertaking has been given to stay proceed- ings, the court may, upon satisfactory evidence of the insolvency of the sureties, order a new undertaking to be executed, filed and served (Code, % 335, 348); and in case of neglect to execute such undertaking within twenty days after service of the order, the appeal may be, on motion, dismissed with costs. (Id.),Prior to the enactment of this clause (in 1859), the court had no power to require any removal of an under- taking on appeal (Willett v. Stringer, sp. t., 15 How. 310); and it may therefore be inferred that the power of the court is strictly confined to these limits: Consequently the insolvency of one only of the sureties is no ground for requiring a new undertaking, nor can the appellant b1 required to replace a lost deposit. 910
Securities. Title of cause. What may be reviewed. Rleedy against defective itderta7iings.]-It an under- taking given to stay proceedings on appeal is so palpably defective that its utter invalidity is obvious at a glance, it may be disregarded. But if its defects, however seri- ous, are not thus palpable, the copy served should be im- mediately returned to the appellant, with specific notice of its defects; and if it is merely irregular, and not void, the remedy is by motion to set it aside. (Parfitt v. Warner, 13 Abb. 471.) If an undertaking necessary to perfect the appeal itself is defective, the remedy is by motion to dismiss the appeal.,ART. 10.-Title of the cause on appeal. The title of the cause is not changed upon appeal (Code, Â§ 326), as far as the parties, and the order of placing them, are concerned. The party appealing is called the appellant, and the adverse party the respondent. (Id.),The cause must, however, be entitled ir? the appellate court, and not in that below. (Clickman v. Cliclcman, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 611; 3 How. 365.),ART. 11.-What may be reviewed on appeal. Only the part appealed from.n]-An appellate tribunal can review only so much of the judgment or order below as has been appealed from. (Robertson v. Bullions, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 243; Kelsey v. Western, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 500; Bell v. Holford, 1 Duer, 58.) .No errors in favor of appellant.]-Errors in favor of an appellant, the other party not having appealed at all, cannot be reviewed, or in any way taken into account (Weisser v. Denison, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 68; Glassner v. Wheaton, 2 E. D. Smith, 352; Beach v. Raymond, id. 496; see Rooney v. Second Av. R. R., 18 N. Y. 368; Rob- bins v. Codman, 4 E. D. Smith, 315); but the correctness of every finding in his favor must be assumed, whether sustained by the evidence or not. (Fakle v. Whi)ile, 39,911
What may be reviewed. Only objections raised below. Barb. 339.) And no decision on any point, rendered at the suggestion of the appellant, can be reviewed, even though it proved to be injurious to him in its results (Ford v. David, 1 Bosw. 569; see Fairbanks v. Corlies, 3 E. D. Smith, 582; 1 Abb. 150; Orser v. Gsrossiman, 4 E. D. Smith, 443.),Only objections raised beloow.]-The appellate court will not review any objection which was not raised below, and which, if it ]lad been, might by any possibility have been obviated. (Ct. of Appeals, Stewart v. Smith, 14 Abb. 75; JTudd v. O'Brien, 21. N. Y. 186; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Protection Ins. Co., 14 N. Y. 85; Barnes v. Perine, 12 N. Y.

Harris, 30 id. 338; Hunt v. Hoboken LanLd Co., 1 Hilt. 161; Fenn v. Timpson, 4 E. D. Smith, 276; see Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y. 40; Greason v. Keteltas, 17 id. 491.) And where a particular ruling was objected to below on certain specified grounds, no other grounds of objection, which, if mentioned below, might possibly have been obviated, will be considered on appeal. (Meakings v. Croimwell, 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 136; Tattersall v. Hass, 1 Hilt. 56; Parsons v. Disbrow, 1 E. D. Smith, 547; Dlunam v. Simmons, 3 Hill, 609; see Durgin v. Ireland, 14 N. Y. 322; Barber v. Rose, 5 Hill, 76; Edgertoib v. Thomas, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 40.) So, where a mere general objection was interposed below, no objec- tions going only to a part of the ruling, and which could possibly have been obviated, will be considered. (Belknwp v. Sealey, 14 N. Y. 143; Sheldon v. Wood, 2 Bosw. 267.),Where a material fact was assumed in the court below .to exist, without any objection on account of the want of evidence thereof, such objection cannot be raised upon appeal. (Jtencks v. Smbit, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 40; Paige v. Fazaclkerly, 36 Barb. 392; Munson v. Hegeman, 10 id. 912
What may be reviewed Only objections raised below. 112; Willard v. Bridge, 4 id. 361; Hunter v. Sandy Hill, 6 Hill, 410; Thurmann v. Cameron, 24 Wend. 87; Oakley v. Valt Borne, 21 id. 305; Ford v. Monroe, 20 id. 211; J uee71at v. Bond, 19 id. 444; Patterson v. Westervelt, 17 id. 545; Jackson v. Roberts, 11 id. 422.) Irregularities not referred to in the papers upon which a motion is made at special term, are not available on appeal from the order made thereon. (Shipkman v. Shafer, 14 Abb. 449; see Elie v. Huller, 10 id. 287;. 6 Bosw. 661; Campbell v. Wright, 21 How. 9.),But objections which could not possibly have been obviated below, may be raised at any time, and are avail- able on appeal, though not mentioned before (Beelnman v. .Frost [Ct. of Errors], 18 Johns. 544; Palmer v. Lorillard [Ot. of Errors], 16 id. 348; Cole v. Blunt, 2 Bosw. 116; Sanford v. Granger, 12 Barb. 392; see Pepper v. Haight, 20 Barb. 429; Waller v. Harris, 20 Wend. 555), or not raised in as specific a form as they ought to have been. (Merritt v. Seaman, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 168.) So objections to the jurisdiction,of the court (Code, Â§ 148; Valarino v. Thomplson, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 576), or to the absence of any cause of action in the complaint (Code, Â§ 148; Cole v. Blunt, 2 Bosw. 116; iayner v. Clark, 7 Barb. 581) may be raised for the first time on appeal; provided the defects are such as could not properly have been amended below, and not otherwise. (See Lounsbury v. Purdy, 18 N. Y. 515.),Nei evidence.]-As a rule, the appellate tribunal acts .upon the case precisely as it was presented to the court below, and cannot receive or notice new evidence. (Mitchell v. Lennox, 14 Wend. 662; Wendell v. Lewis, 6 Paige, 233; see Studwell v. Palmer, 5 id. 166; Attwood v. Small, 6 Clark & Fin. 232.)

(See Bank of Charleston v. Emeric, supra.),In that class of appeals in which the appellate court has a wide discretion to determine the controversy itself, or remand it for a new examination below, it may receive evidence for the guidance of this discretion. (Shultz v. Whitney, sp. t., 9 Abb. 71; 17 How. 471.),All evidence below to be conlsidered.]-Where an appeal raises questions as to the propriety of the determination upon the evidence, all the evidence below must be taken into accoqnt; and a new trial should. be allowed, even though part of the evidence on account of which it is demanded was improperly received, if other and compe- tent evidence mighfc possibly have been given.

(Miller v. Eagle Ins. Co., 3 E. D. Smith, 184.),ART. 13.-Dismissal of appeal. On what grounds.I]-An appeal will be dismissed on motion, without examining the merits, if the decree below is not appealable (Smith v. White, 23 N. Y. 572; Wait v. l a(t Allen, 22 id. 319; Ely v. Holton, 15 id. 595; McAllis- ter v. Albion PlanLtroad Co., '10 id. 353; N. Y. Central . R. v. Marvin, 11 id. [1 Kern.] 276), or not appealable to the particular court to which it is brought (Wiggins v. Tallmnadge, 7 How. 404); or if the appellant is a person having no right to appeal at all (Matter of Bristol, 16 Abb. 397); or if the appeal was brought too late (Ct. of Appeals, Wells v. Danforth, 7 How. 197; Ban5 of Geneva v. HotcJihkiss, 5 id. 478; Code Rep. N. S. 153; Mills v. Shult, 2 E. D. Smith, 139), or too early (McMahlaon v. Harrison0, 5 How. 360); or if the palties'had stipulated not to appeal (Townseiud v. _Iasterson Stone Co., 15 N8. Y. 587); or, in case of a second appeal, where the costs of the first appeal have not been paid. (Dresser v. Brooks [Ct. of Appeals], 5 How. 75.) If, upon the hearing, the appellant does not furnish the papers which are necessary to inform the court as to the nature of the appeal, it will be dismissed. (Sun Mutual Ins. Co. v. Dwight, 1 Hilt. 50.) An appeal will be dismissed if the appeal book, in any way, fails to show matters which the court can review (Westeott v. TKompsont, 16 N.'Y. 613; Livingston v. ?acdeliffe, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 189; Sturgis v. Merry, id. 190; King v. Dennis, id. 191); as where, on appeal from the judgment of a court of record, the case does not contain any excep- tions (Hunt v. Bloomer, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 341.; Colie v. Brouwn, Code Bep. N. S. 416; Cheesebrough v. Agate, 26,.915 -
Dismissal of appeal. In what cases. Barb. 603; 7 Abb. 32); or if the case made fails to show the court in which judgment was rendered, or to show such a judgment as is set forth in the notice of appeal; or where the facts stated make it probable only, that an ap- pealable judgment has been rendered. (Lahens v. Fielden [Ct. of Appeals], 15 Abb. 177.) But it will not be dis- missed merely because a part of the papers, on which the order below was made, are not embraced in the return, if the omission is explained as not originating in miscon- duct of the appellant, and there is enough in the papers to present a subject for review. (McGregor v. Comistock, 19 N. Y. 581.),And even where the appeal was originally regular, yet it will be dismissed if meanwhile the power of the court to review such cases is taken away by the legislature (Gale v. Wells, 7 How. 191); or if the controversy has been settled between the parties (Shank v. Shoemaker, 18 N. Y. 489; Smith v. Hart, 11 How. 203); or if the appellant in any way waives his appeal. (Benniett v. Tan Sycicel, 18 N. Y. 481.),An appeal from one court to another will be dismissed if the undertaking is defective; e. g., by reason of the failure of the sureties to justify, when excepted to by the respondent. (Langley v. Warner, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 606; Kelsey v. Campbell, 14 Abb. 368.),An appeal cannot be dismissed on the ground of its frivolousness (Dey v. Walton, 2 Hill, 403), nor on account of the appellant's delay in proceeding (ib.); though where the appellant had countermanded the appeal, and neg- lected to prosecute it, the court dismissed it. (Hogan v. Broply, 2 Code Rep. 77.),Where an appeal was taken from an order, and dismissed by the general term, on the ground that tlhe subject of the order was in the discretion of the special term, the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the general tern, with costs, instead of dismissing the appeal. (Briggs v. Fanlenburglh, 22 N. Y. 467.) 916
Dismissal of appeal. The motion. On whose motion.]-Though the motion to dismiss an appeal is of course usually made by the respondent, yet it may be made by the appellant (Lanmzan v. Leiwiston R. B., 18 N. Y. 493; see Porter v. Jones, 7 How. 192); and this course is sometimes necessary, when an appeal has been irregularly taken, or has been defeated by any subsequent event, to save costs and the chance of a new appeal. (See ib.) Indeed it has been held that every appellant has a right to dismiss his appeal at pleasure, on payment of costs. (Wrarren v. Eddy, 13 Abb. 28; 32 Barb. 664.),But an order obtained by the appellant for this purpose is inoperative until the costs thereby imposed are paid. (Burnett v. Harkness, 4 How. 158; 2 Code Rep. 100.),Where motion should be made.]-The motion must be made before the appellate tribunal. Thus, where an appeal has been taken from one court to another, the motion to dismiss the appeal must be addressed to the latter court; and where the appeal is taken to the general term of the same court, the motion cannot be made at a special term. (People v. Muryply, sp. t., N. Y. Trans., Jan. 15, 1864; Barnrtrm v. Seneca Co. Bank, sp. t., 6 How. 82; Bradley v. ata Zandt, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 217.) But where an appeal is taken to another court, it has been held that the motion to dismiss should be made at a special term of that court. (Griswold v. Van Densen, 2 E. D. Smith, 178; see Irwiin v. Muir, sp. t., 4 Abb. 133; 13 How. 409.),When and how to move.]-Although the motion may be made, on due notice; at the argument upon the merits, in the regular order of the cause upon the calendar, yet a separate motion may be made on a non-enumerated day; and this is the most proper course, as it saves time and ex- pense to both parties. (See Williams v. Fitch, 15 Barb. 654.),Notice of ntotion.--The notice of argument on the part of the respondent commonly includes a notice of motion,___,917
to dismiss. Where a separate motion is niade, the notice may be as follows:,Â§326. Notice of motion to dismiss appeal. [sitle of cause.] [Caption.] . PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that on [motion papers] the respondent will move the court, at [&dc.] on [&c.] that the appeal of the [de- fendant C.

The two orders cannot be combined. If the court has jurisdiction, and can regularly entertain the appeal, it ought not to dismiss it. If it cannot or does not entertain the appeal, it has no power to affirm the decree below.,It is necessary, however, for the appellant to be on his watch lest the respondent should get an order entered affirming the judgment, as. this is a very common prac- tice, and such orders are frequently signed by the presid- ing judge without a critical examination, where an appeal has been dismissed after argument upon the merits.,Â§327.

Principles of deteomination. Harmless errors.,ART. 14.-Pricwiples of determination. Harmless errors.]-An error which could not possibly have prejudiced the appellant, will be always disregarded.,Thus the admission of incompetent evidence which could not possibly have prejudiced the appellant (Ono/z- daga Mut. Ins. Co. v. Minard, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 98; LoweryJ v. Steward, 3 Bosw. 505; Boyd v. Foot, 5 id. 110; Barton v. Syracuse, 37 Barb. 292; Diven v. Phelps, 34 Barb. 224), as when it is plain that the result must have been the same without it (Belmont v. Coleinan, 1 Bosw. 188; Fitch v. N. v & Erie B. B. Co., 3 Seld. Notes, 24), or where the same facts were afterwards proved by com- petent evidence (Schientc v. Dart, 22 N. Y. 420; Castree v. Gavelle, 4 E. D. Smith, 425; Colvin v. Burnet, 2 Hill, 620), or were admitted by the pleadings (Diven v. Phelps, 34 Barb. 224; .Castree v. Gavelle, supra); an erroneous deci- sion allowing a witness to be questioned as to his opinion, provided the answer of the witness only stated facts (Doolittle v. Eddy, 7 Barb. 74); the refusal to forbid a witness to testify from a written paper, if he did not sub- sequently give any testimony (Howland v. Willetts, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 170); the improper exclusion of a witness, if the fact, to prove which he was called, could not possibly have affected the result (City Bank of Brooklyn v. Dear- born, 20 N. Y. 244); the improper exclusion of evidence upon a question which was finally decided in favor of the appellant (Beekman v. Platnser, 15 Barb. 550); or the exclu- aion ox a proper question which had been already answered in substance by the witness (Park Bank v. Tilton, 15 Abb. 384); an erroneous ruling, that a party was bound to prove certain averments of his pleading, if evidence was sub- sequently given, without contradiction, which entitled the adverse party to recover, even if such averments were true (Gildersleeve v. Mahoney, 5 Duer, 383); thesubmission to the jury of a question which ought to have been decided by the court, where the appellate court can see that the,919
decision of the question by the court must have been the same (Miller v. Eagle Life & Healthl Ins. Co., 2 E. D. Smith, 269); an error in the charge of the judge, upon a point entirely immaterial to the case (Shorter v. People, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 193; Willoghlby v. Comstock, 3 Hill, 389; People v. Wiley, 3 id. 194; Hayden, v. Palmer, 2 id. 205; asf'd, 7 id. 385), or which for any other reason could not have possibly misled the jury (Johnson v. Hudson River R. R.,'20 N. Y. 74; Tass v. Warm an, 2 C. B. [N. S.] 740j see Smith v. N. Y. Central R. R., 29 Barb. 132, 145); or the granting of an alternative order instead of an abso- lute one, where the appellant himself had the election of alternatives (Perry v. Moore, 2 E. D. Smith, 32); will be disregarded on appeal. :Trifling iijury.]-A decree will not be reversed on account of an error which causes but a nominal injury to the appellant. Thus, where judgment should have been given to the plaintiff with nominal damages, leaving him subject to costs, but was erroneously ordered for the defendants, the errorwas held too trifling to be corrected on appeal. (MecConihe v. N. Y. & Erie R. R., 20 N. Y. 495.),Wrong reasoning.]-If a judgment or order is right in point of law, the fact that it could not be sustained upon the theory of law on which the court below proceeded, is no reason for reversing it (Munro v. Potter, 34 Barb. 358; 22 How. 49;, Gillespie v. Torrance, 7 Abb. 462; Deland v. Richardson, 4 Den. 95; see Davis v. Spencer, 24 N. Y. 386; Scott v. Pilkington, 15 Abb. 280); unless there is some reason to believe that the erroneous view of the law, ex- pressed by the court, induced the appellant to abstain from offering evidence which would have been material for him under the view taken by the appellate court. (See Munro v. Potter, supra; Mills v. Fan Yoorhies, 20 N. Y. 412; 10 Abb. 152.) 920,APPEALS 'IN GIENERAL.
Principles of determination. Presumptions. Second appeal It is no objection to an affirmance of, a judgment that it can only be sustained upon grounds that were not suggested by counsel below. (Oneida Bank v. Ontario Bank, 21 N.Y. 490, 504; see White v. Madison, 26 id. 117.),Presunmlptions.]-The presumption always is that the judgment of the court below was right (Grant v. Morse, 22 N. Y. 323; Williamson v. Field, 2 Barb. Ch. 281; Cut- n.ins v. Barkalow, N. Y. Trans.;. April 19, 1864), and regularly rendered. Thus, where the papers failed to show whether the judgment appealed from was rendered at general or special term, tie Court of Appeals presumed that it was given at general Item. (Darby v. Callaghan, 16 N. Y. 71.) So where the appeal book did not show that the court below had jurisdiction, its jurisdiction was presumed, it being a court of general jurisdiction (Matter of the Empire City Bank, 18 N. Y. 199; 8 Abb. 192 ;Bid- well v. Astor Ins. Co., 16 N. Y. 263); but such a presump- tion would not be made in favor of a court of inferior and special jurisdiction only. It will be presumed that the court below did whatever was its duty to do (Corning v. Slosson, 16 N. Y. 294); and in general, all reasonable presumptions will be made in support of the judgment. (Viele v. Troy & Boston R. B., 20 N. Y. 184; Grant v. Morse, 22 id. 323; Carman v. Pultz, 21 id. 547.),Third parties.]-The decree appealed from will not be reversed or altered so as to deprive third parties, who had no notice of the hearing upon the appeal, of any rights under it, to.costs or otherwise. (McCanammon v. Worrall, 11 Paige, 99.) Second appeal.]-Where the identical questions are pre- sented on a second appeal, which were argued and decided upon a former appeal in the same cause, the court will not reconsider its former adjudication, notwithstanding the,116,921
Principles of determination. Effect ns decision. want of unanimity in making the same, or the opposite reasons given by those' who concurred in it. (Oakley v. Aspinwall, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 500; see Buell v. Loc7elort, 8 N. Y. [4 Sold.] 55.),An appellant is not allowed to argue a second time, on appealing from the judgment on a demurrer, the same questions which were argued on an appeal from the order sustaining such demurrer. (Keteltas v. Myers, 1 Abb. 403; 3 E. D. Smith, 83.),Default.]-The court is not bound, in all cases, to reverse a judgment or order appealed from, upon the failure of the respondent to appear on the argument. (Seneca Nation v. Knight, 23 N. Y. 498.) If the appellant desires it, the court should hear him upon the merits, and render a con- clusive decision. (Ib.) Thus where a party, in whose favor judgment was rendered, appealed on the ground that it was not sufficiently favorable to him, and the respondent purposely neglected to appear on the argu- ment, with a view to having a new trial of the whole issue, it was held proper for the appellate court, at the request of the appellant, to examine the case upon the merits, and, being of opinion that his exceptions were untenable, to affirm the judgment. (Ib.),ART. 15.-Effect of the determination upon the cause. What is deemed settled.]-In all subsequent proceedings, the decision of the appellate tribunal must be regarded as conclusive upon the court below, on all points which were necessarily raised before the former for determina- tion, and this notwithstanding the opinion delivered in the court above took no notice of some of those points. (N. Y. & N. Haven R. R. v. Schuyler, sp. t., 8 Abb. 239.),The court below should-be governed, in further pro- ceedings in the cause, by the principles stated in on opinion delivered in the appellate court, and with its 922

Where an order, made upon certain specified grounds, has been affirmed, without any positive dissent of the ,ppellate court for the principles stated below, it should be assumed in the subsequent proceedings that those principles are correct. (Green v. Clark, 13 Barb. 57.),In a very peculiar case, where the court below saw plainly that the appellate court had been materially mis- led as to the facts of the case, the appeal book being in manuscript, and it being impossible to say that the deci- sion above would certainly have been the same if the facts had been correctly understood, the court below refused to be bound by the decision on appeal. (Reynolds v. Davis, 5 Sands. 267.) Effect on judgment below.]-W~len, a default having been opened, the judgment is allowed to stand as secu- rity, and the plaintiff recovers judgment, which is reversed on appeal, the former judgment falls with the latter. (Pierce v. Thomas, 4 E. D. Smith, 354.) Decree not to be m.odifedl.]-After a final decree has been rendered by the appellate court (i. e., where a judgment or order has been affirmed, or has been reversed without ordering a new trial), the court below cannot modify the decree in any manner except by consent, either upon motion in the cause (Utica Ins. Co. v. Lynch, 2 Barb. Ch. R. 573; Lyon v. Merritt, 6 Paige, 473) or in a new action. (Gelston v. Codwise, 1 Johns. Ch. 189.),ART. 16.--lRe-argumenit. As of course.]-If the appellate'court is equally divided in opinion, it is a matter of course to order a re-argument.' This, however, rarely takes place, except in the Coirt of Appeals, where the concurrence of five judges is required for a decision.,923
Re-argument. What may be reviewed. On motion.]-In cases of importance, involving difficult questions, the courts not infrequently allow a re-argu. ment, after the decision of an appeal, on the motion of a party aggrieved; especially if the decision has not been. unanimous. (See Hoyt v. Thonpson, 19 N. Y. 207; Tracy v. Taliage, 14 id. 162, 210.) .In general, the motion is granted if there appears to be a probability of error in the decision; but if the court sees clearly that the decision was correct, it will deny the motion, instead of listening to a new argument. (See Tracy v. Talmage, supra; Teaz v. Chrystie, 2 E. D. Smith, 635; 2 Abb. 259.),A private disagreement among the judges, not mani- fested by any of them in public, cannot be made a ground for a re-argument. (Mason v. Jones, 3 N. Y.

Stilwell, 4 E. D. Smith, 512), the allowance of a leading question (Btdllong v. Â¥an Nlostrand, 24 Barb. 25), the granting leave to amend a pleading (anL Duzer v. Howe, 21 N. Y. 531; Hodges v.

Rich- ardson, 2 Bosw. 248; Ford v. David, 1 id. 569; Gould v. Ramsey, 21 How. 97), the disregard, by the court below, of a defect in the complaint, one of the links in a chain of facts necessary to constitute a cause of action having been omitted therefrom, but proved upon the trial (Lounisbury v. Ptrrdy, 18 N. Y. 515), are all matters of discretion, which will not be reviewed on appeal from the judgment; except in a clear case of the abuse of such discretion (see 1Hendricls v. Decier, 35 Barb. 298; Bludlong v. Van Nos- trand, 24 Barb. 25), or where the court has refused to exercise its discretion, and has decided such t question as a matter of right. (Russell v. Conn, 20 N. Y. 81; Beach v. Chamberlain, 3 Wend. 366.)
What may be reviewed. Costs. IrregularitieS. Costs.]-Where costs are awarded as a matter of right, the disposition of any question arising thereon is of course reviewable on appeal from the judgment. (See Daniels v. Lyon, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 549.),Where they are in the discretion of the court, as a general rule the exercise of such discretion will not be reviewed (Decker v. Gardiner, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 29); but if any serious objection is shown to the award of costs, it may be reviewed, provided the appeal was taken in good faith upon other grounds (Inglis v. Mansfield, 3 Clark & Fin. 362; MaScaulay v. Adam, id. 385; Lewis v. Smith, 1 Macn. & G. 417; see Jonlsoan v. Taber, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 319; People v. Clafike, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld:] 349,370); and this although the judgment is affirmed on all other points. (Ib.) But if the appeal on other points is merely colorable, the question of costs will not be reviewed. (Clyne's trustees v. Dunnett, Mlacl. & E. 28; Attorl)'y-Gen. v. Butcher, 4 Russ. 180.),Mistakes, &c.]-Clerical and arithmetical errors are amendable on summary application in the first instance, and will not be reviewed upon appeal from a judgment; at least, until such an application has been made and denied. (Rogers v. Hosackt [Ct. of Errors], 18 Wend. 319.) And in general, errors which the court below can and will correct upon motion, should not be made the ground of an appeal. (Bunbury v. Bolton, 1 Bro. P. C. 434.),An error in the amount of damages assessed,.plainly the result of miscalculation, cannot be reviewed on a( simple appeal from a judgment. (Nevins v. Bay State Steanboat Co., 4 Bosw. 225.),Irregularities.]-An irregularity in the form ps the judgment as entered is not reviewable on appeal from the judgment, if the decision or verdict was regular. (Ingersoll v. Bosutick, 22 N. Y. 425; Johnson v. CarnleJ, 10 id. [6 Seld.] 570; Witherhead v. Allen. 28 Barb. 661; 926
What may be reviewed. Irregularities. King v. Stafford, 5 How. 30; see M'ayor &,. of N. Y. v. JLons, 24 How. 280.) The omission of the judge or referee trying the cause to find upon a paiticular question of fact (People v. Albright, 14 Abb. 305; 23 How. 306; Heroy v. Kerr, 8 Bosw. 194; 21 How. 409; Hilce v. Sherman, 13 id. 411; Platt v. Thornl, 8 Bosw. 574; Sharp v. 7Wright, 35 Barb. 236; see Ingrauhamn v. Gilbert, 20 Barb. 151), the entry of a judg- ment in disregard of an order staying proceedings (BElcel v. Dodge, 33 Barb. 336), the assessment of damages against the defendant in the court below, on his failure to answer, without any affidavit having been filed proving his default (Catlin v. Billings, 16 N. Y. 622), the disposal of any mat- ters at the circuit, which ought to have been heard at a special term (Dart v. 1licAdam, 27 Barb. 187), or the taxation of costs by the clerk without authority (Matter of lFourth Avenue, 11 Abb. 189), is not reviewable upon an appeal from the judgment. The remedy in such case is by motion (ib.); and if such motion is denied, an appeal will doubtless lie from the order. Where a judgment had been entered in a grossly irregu- lar manner, and the court below had refused to correct it on motion, the error was reviewed on an appeal from the judgment. (J'ohnson v. Farrell, 10 Abb. 384.) In that case, the plaintiff had recovered judgment for an amount less than $50, and the defendant was entitled to costs, exceeding that amount. A separatejudgment was entered in favor of each party, and for this error, the judgments were reversed. The entire absence of a written decision of the judge or referee trying a cause without a jury, mnay be an error reviewable on appeal. It has been so held in other states which have adopted the Code (Ragan v. MGcCoy, 26 Mo. 166; Slttter v. Streit, 21 id. 157; Bates v. Bower, 17 id. 550; Russell v. Armador, 2 Cal. 305); the decisions there going so far as to hold that the omission of any finding of facts in the decision of a judge or referee, is an error,927
What may be reviewed. What order . for which the judgment should be reversed. (lb.) The rule in this state appears to be otherwise. (Parsons v. Suydanm, 3 E. D. Smith, 276.) In Sands v. Church (6 X. Y. [2 Seld.] 347), the question was raised, but not decided.,The failure of the judge to specify in his decision the relief granted, or the determination of the action, has been held an error, reviewable on appeal from the judg. ment. (C7hamberlain v. Dempsey, 14 Abb. 241.),Intermediate orbders.]-On an appeal from a judgment, the court may review any intermediate order involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judgment. (Code, Q 329.) It is not necessary, in order to secure the right of such review, to take a separate appeal from such an order. (Attwood v. Small, 6 Clark & Fin. 232.),What orders will be reviewed.]-An interlocutory order, in excess of the power of the court, adding a new party plaintiff to the suit, the original plaintiffs having no cause of action (Davis v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 526), and an interlocutory decree, in an action for an accounting, declaring the rights of the parties and order- ing a reference (Wing v. Hittington., 5 Seld. Notes, 38), will be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment.,TUpon appeal from reversal o, a judgment, the Court of Appeals will review the decision of the general term upon the question of granting a new trial; for if any possible proofs applicable to the issues in the case would entitle the party to a recovery, the court below had no discretion to refuse a new trial. (Griffin v. Marquardt, 17 N. Y. 28; Astor v. L'Amoureux, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 107.),An order striking out a material part of the defendant's answer may be reviewed on appeal from the judgment (Cowles v. Cowles, 9 How. 361.),What orders will not.]-The refusal of a referee to'ad- journ a hearing before him, where it was a matter resting in his discretion (Carpenter v. Haynes [Ct. of Appeals],: 928
What may be reviewed. Principles of determination. Code Rep. N. S. 414), the denial of a motion to stay the trial in the court below till the decision of another cause (James v. Chalmers, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 209), and the pro- ceedings upon a reference of a specific question of faet, the report being read in evidence without objection on the trial (Ellent v. Butgers Fire Ins. Co., 2 Bosw. 482; 6 Abb. 68), are not reviewable on a simple appeal from the judgment.,Nor does an appeal from a judgment bring up for review an order denying a motion for a new trial (Fry v. Bennett, 7 Abb. 352; 16 low. 385), nor a previous order in the action requiring the defendant to be arrested and held to bail. (sRoss v. West, 2 Bosw. 360.),ART. 2.-Principles of determination. Presumptions.]-Error on tlhe part of the court below must be clearly shown. The appellate court will presume nothing in favor of the party alleging error; but, on the contrary, where the appeal book contains no findings upon important facts, will presume those facts to have been such as would warrant the judgment rendered. (Carman v. Pultz, 21 P. Y. 547; Reformed Protestant Dutch Church v. Browm [Ot. of Appeals], 24 How. 76; Grant v. Morse, 22 N. Y. 323; Phelps v. 3PDonald, 26 id. 82; Hoyt v. Hoyt, 8 Bosw. 511; Richardson v. Dugan, id. 207; see Harden v. Palmer, 2 E. D. Smith, 172.) Yet the court will take notice of the omission of an essential fact in the finding of the referee or court below, and if the evidence did not tend to prove it will reverse the judgment on this ground. (Ames v. Peck, 3 Sold. Notes, 39.) Exceptions appearing in the case as settled, will be assumed to have been taken in due time and form. (Hunt v. Bloomer, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 341.) Imperfect findings.]--A judgment on the report of a referee will not be reversed on account of his failure to,117,929
Principles of determination. For what errors reversed. find in regard to certain issues as to which there was no evidence to warrant findings in favor of the appellant. (Alger v. Ra.ymond, 7 Bosw. 418.),In a recent case, the judgment of a referee was re. versed, on the ground that it was not warranted by his findings on the questions of fact. (Buckingham, v. Payne, 36 Barb. 81.) But this appears to be contrary to the cur- rent of decisions, especially in the Court of Appeals. (See Phelps v. M'Donald, 26 N. Y. 82; Grant v. Morse, 22 id. 323; Carman v. Pultz, 21 id. 547; Reformed Dutch Church v. Brown, 24 How. 76.),The court should look into the evidence to supply a finding of fact, if it can be there found, in support of the judgment. (Sinclair v. Tallmadge, 35 Barb. 602; Higgins v. Moore, 6 Bosw. 344; see Spencer v. Ballon, 18 N. Y. 327.),Harmless error.]-A judgment will not be reversed for an error which cannot possibly have prejudiced the appellant. (See ante, p. 920.),Errors whuich nay have done harm.]-On an appeal from a judgment, if an error has been committed which may by possibility have prejudiced the appellant, the judgment must be reversed (Brown v. Richardson, 20 N. Y. 476; Erben v. Lorillard, 19 id. 299; Williams v. Fitch, 18 id. 546; Underhill v. N. Y. & Harlemn R. R., 21 Barb. 489; Worrall v. Parmelee, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 519; Weber v. Kingsland, 8 Bosw. 415, 441; Hahn v. Vani Doren, 1 E. D. Smith, 411; Clark v. Force, 19 Wend. 232; Farmers' & Manufacturers' Bank v. Whinfield, 24 id. 419; Gillet v. Mead, 7 id. 193; Clar7ce v. Dutcher, 9 Cow. 674; Anthoine v. Coit, 2 Hall, 40); and this although the court may deem it probable that the error had no effect upon the result. (Brozwn v. Richardson, supra; Weber v. Kingsland, supra.) 930
Principles of determination. Amendable errors. Errors cured. This principle has been occasionally lost sight of, owing to the indiscriminate citation of decisions upon motions for a new trial upon a case and upon exceptions, between which there is a material difference in this respect. (See ante, l. 548.) Thus in Renatud v. Peck (2 Hilt. 137), the court was misled by such a misapplication of the cases into affirming a judgment, notwithstanding an acknowledged error duly excepted to, on the ground that it seemed probable that justice had been done in the cause.,Where improper evidence has been given under excep- tion (on a point as to which there is conflicting evidence), though it be only cumulative, the judgment will be reversed. (Worrall v. Parm1elee, supra; Hah7 v. Van Doren, supra; Marqualnd v. Webb, 16 Johns. 89; Osgood v. Manlmttan CGompany, 3 Cow. 612.),An exception to the exclusion of material testimony cannot be answered by insisting that the witness was incompetent, where the objection to his competency was taken at the trial and overruled. (Talpan v. Butler, 7 Bosw. 480.) Amendable errors.]-A judgment will not be reversed for a defect which might have been cured by amendment at the discretion of the court below, and which that court disregarded, although the amendment was not actually made; the appellant not being shown to be really preju- diced. (Lounsbury v. Purdy, 18 N. Y. 515; Bennett v. Julson, 21 N. Y. 238; Cardell v. McNiel, id. 341; Banik of Havana v. Mlagee, 20 id. 355; Lake Ontario &c. R. R. v. Marvine, 18 id. 585; Bate v. Graham, 11 id. [1 Kern., 237; M'Cormicl v. Pic7cering, 4 id. [4 Comst.] 276.),Errors cered.]-Though an error was committed at the trial, and an exception duly taken, yet if, in the course of the trial, the error was fully corrected, or the exception waived, the judgment will not be reversed on that account. (Weber v. Kingsland, 8 Bosw. 415, 437.),931
Principles of determination. Errors cured. Mistrial Thus, a judgment will not be reversed for the refusal of the court below to grant a nonsuit, though the plain. tiff had at the time failed to prove his case, if the neces sary evidence was supplied afterward, by either party. (SchJenectady and Saratoga P. R. Co. v. TIlwtcher, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 102; Kent v. Harcourt, 33 Barb. 491; M2iller v. The Eagle Life and eealth Ins. Co., 2 E. D. Smith, 284; Colvin v. Burnet, 2 Hill, 620; eCarsey v. Prtyn, 7 Johns. 179; Oakes v. Thornton, 8 Fost. [N. H.] 44; Carson v. Allen, 6 Dana, 395.) So an exception to the admission of secondary evidence of the contents of a document is waived by putting in evidence the document itself, to the same effect. (Colvin v. Burnet, supra; Hearsey v. Pruyn, supra.) And the exclusion of evidence, when offered, is no ground for reversal, if it is subsequently admitted (Stephens v. People, 19 N. Y. 571; Morgan v. Reid, 7 Abb. 215), especially if admitted on a renewed offer by the exceptant. (Forrest v. Forrest, 6 Duer, 102; affirmed, 25 N. Y. 501.) So an error in the judge's charge, if fully rectified by him, is not an available objection to the judgment. (Curtis v. Rochester and Syr. R. R., 18 N. Y. 542.),Frivolous demurrer7.]-On appeal from judgment on a demurrer as frivolous, the judgment should be affirmed if the demurrer was bad, even though it was not frivol- ous. (Witwcrhcead v. Allen, 28 Barb. 661; Wresley v. Benr nett, 5 Abb. 498, 503; Martin v. Kanouse, 2 Abb. 327; Iaverty v. Griswold, 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 316; 6 Duer, 688; see Manning v. Tyler, 21 N. Y. 570.),Mistrial.]-Even though a judgment appears to be correct on the merits, it will be reversed for a mistrial; as, for example, where a verdict has been taken subject to the opinion of the court, in a case not proper for such a proceeding. (Cobb v. Cornish, 16 N. Y. 602; 6 Abb. 129; 15 How. 407; Gilbert v. Beach, 16 N. Y. 606; Purchase v. Mattison, 15 Abb. 402; 25 N. Y. 211.) 932
Principles of determination. New trial,--- Belief not asced.]--If equitable relief is necessary to sustain the judgment (e. g., the reforming of a written instrument on the ground of mistake), the court will not give such relief unless it is asked for; but will reverse the judgment. (Sheldon v. Smith, 28 Barb. 593.),AnT. 3.-Award of new trial. The appellate court may, if necessary or proper, order a new trial. (Code, Â§ 330.),This is not a matter of mere discretion. A new trial niust be ordered, whenever it is necessary, as a matter of right (Griffin v. Marquardt, 17 N. Y. 28); and it seems that it may be ordered, where it is not a matter of right. (See Mills v. Van Voorhies, 20 N. Y. 412; 10 Abb. 152.) Nvew trial.]-The appellate court, on reversing a judg- ment, need not grant a new trial where it is apparent that no possible state of proof, applicable to the issues, can entitle the respondent to a judgment (lEdmonstoo v. MeLoud, 16 N. .Y. 543); and therefore should not, where there is no dispute as to the facts; and the only question is, which party is, upon conceded facts, entitled to judg- ment. (Marquat v. Marquat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336.),But in every other case, on reversing a judgment in a civil action, a new trial must be ordered. (Griffin v. Mar- quardt, 17 N. Y. 28; Astor v. L'Amoureux, 8 id. [4 Seld.] 107; Mosset v. Sac7ett, 18 id. 522; Griin v. Cranston, 1 Bosw. 281; Meyer v. Louisville, 7 Abb. 6; 26 Barb. 609; see Schenc7 v. Dart, 22 N. Y. 420; Chase v. Peck, 21 id. 581, 587; overruling in effect Hannay v. Pell, 3 E. D. Smith, 432.) If a new trial is ordered as to any part of the judgment, it must be had as to the whole. (Story v. N. Y. & Harlemt R. R., 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 85.#) * This decision was rendered in a case not governed by the Code, and without reference thereto. But the Code does not seem to change the rule. (See ields v. Moul 15 Abb. 6.),9M3
Modification. Affirmance on deduction.,AnT. 4.-Modification of judgment. The appellate court may modify the judgment appealed from, as well as affirm or reverse it (Code, Â§ 330); and may do so as to any or all of the parties. (Id.),Reversal as to portion of amozunt, &c.]-A judgment for the payment of money, or relating to several matters, which are so presented that the court can render a final decision upon each, may be affirmed in part, and reversed in part. (Fields v. Moul, 15 Abb. 6; * Staats v. Hudson River R. R., 23 How. 463.),Reversal as to some only of t7tel)arties.]-The Code has abrogated the common law rule that an entire judgment against several defendants could not be reversed as to one, and affirmed as to another; and this may, and should be done, where a several judgment would have been proper in the court below. (Montgomery Bank7 v. Albany Bankl, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 459; Giraud v. Beach & Stagg, 4 E. D. Smith, 27; 10 How. 369; see Williams v. Christie, 4 Duer, 29.9),Affirmance on deduction.]-The court may direct that the judgment be affirmed on the respondent's remitting that part of it which is erroneous, if such part is capable of exact calculation (Chouteau v. Sutydam, 21 N. Y. 179, 185; Boyd v. Foot, 5 Bosw. 110; MSAuley v. Mildrum, 9 Abb. 198; see Corning v. Corning, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 97); but not if any evidence is necessary for the purpose of making such calculation. (Mosset v. Sackett, 18 N. Y. 522.),Where such a calculation can be made, a new trial will not be granted merely to enable the appellant to bring up a new question. (MeAuley v. Mildrun, 9 Abb. 198.),* Overruling Kasson v. MAIs (8 How. 377). t Farrell v. Calkins (10 Barb. 348), is clearly overruled by these cases (See also .~/ds v. Mouil, 15 Abb. 6.) 934
Modification. Restitution. Entry of decision. Though the decisions cited apply this doctrine only to money judgments, we know of no reason why it should not apply to every species of judgment, so long as the court can tell precisely what ought to be thus remitted, or can be certain that any want of precision will injure the respondent only.,It seems to be upon the same principle that a judgment is affirmed, upon the respondent's electing to modify it in other respects. Thus where damages against joint wrong doers were severed, it was held that the plaintiff might remit all the amounts except one, and thereupon the judgment should be affirmed. (O'Shea v. Kircier, 4 Bosw. 120; 8 Abb. 69.),ART. 5.-Restitution. When the judgment is reversed or modified, the appel- late court may make complete restitution of all property and rights lost by the erroneous judgment. (Code, Â§ 330.),It is the duty of the court to exercise such power of restitution, where it renders final judgment in favor of the appellant. (Estus v. Baldwin, sp. t., 9 How. 80.),And where a new trial was ordered, the plaintiff having collected the amount of the judgment, he was required to pay into court the money so collected, with interest from the time of its collection, to abide the order of the appel- late court after the new trial should be had. (Britton v. Phillips, 24 How. 111.),ART. 6.-Entry of decision on appeal. If the cause is finally disposed of on the appeal, the decision of the appellate court should be entered in the form of a judgment, but if otherwise, an order only should be entered. In case of a simple affirmance, there is no new judg- ment entered, but the old one stands with an entry of affirmance by the appellate court, unless costs are awarded, when a new judgment should be entered for the costs as adjusted. (Eoi v. Crookce, sp. t., 6 How. 462.),935
Entry of decision. What is appealable. The judgment of affirmance must not embrace any- thing secured by the original judgment in the court below; but only the costs and disbursements on the appeal, and the damages specially awarded as such by the appellate court. (Ib.; Halsey v. Flint, 15 Abb. 371.),On the reversal of a judgment, with an award of a new trial, a mere order to that effect is all that is necessary; but if final judgment is rendered.upon such reversal, the decision should be entered as a judgment.,CHAPTER CXXVL APPEALS TO THE COURT OF APPEALS.

The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review, on appeal, every actual determination made at a general term of the Supreme Court, Superior Court and Court of Common Pleas of the city of New York, or Superior Court of Buffalo, in the following cases; provided the actions in which they arise were not commenced in a justice's court, or the marine or district courts of New York city; or, having been so commenced, were discontinued there, and prosecuted in another court, pursuant to % 60 and 68 of
What is appealable. Actual determination. the Code: 1. In a judgment in an action commenced therein, or brought there from another court: 2. In an order affecting a substantial right, made in such action; when such order, in effect, determines the action, and pre- vents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken, and when such order grants or refuses a new trial: 3. In a final order, affecting a substantial right, made in a spe- cial proceeding, or upon a summary application in an action after judgment. (Code, Â§ 11.) Ithas also jurisdiction to review finaldecrees "in actions which were originally commenced in the late Court of Chancery of this state." (Code, Â§ 460.) Â· All cases pending in the late court for the correction of errors on the first Monday of July, 1847, were on that day transferred to the Court of Appeals, by the constitution, and it has, of course, jurisdiction of them. (Const., art. 6, Â§ 25; Laws 1847, 322, ch. 280, Â§ 12.) Actual determination.j]-No appeal lies to this court from anything but an actual determination of the court below, at a general term. (Lake v. Gibson, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 188; Kanouse v. Martin, 6 How.' 240.),A formal judgment of the general term, entered without a hearing, upon a case submitted by stipulation, with a view to an appeal, is not an actual determination of the court below. (cridley v. Daggett [Ot. of Appeals], 6 How. 289.) But where the court, at the request of the moving party, took the papers and examined the questions involved, this was held an actual determination (Seneca Nation v. Zig1ht, 19 N.Y. 587); and so where judgment was rendered against a plaintiff in consequence of his refusal to comply with an order at special term, directing him to make certain co- plaintiffs defendants, or, in default thereof, dismissing his complaint. (Lahens v. Fielden [Ct. of Appeals], 15 Abb. 177.),118,937
What is appealable. Final judgment. Judgment must be final.l-It is the policy of the Code to allow only one appeal to the Court of Appeals in the same cause, and that at the end of the suit in the court of original jurisdiction. (Swarthout v. Curtis, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 415; 5 How. 198; Hollister BAank v. Vail, 15 . y. 593.),The issues must be tried and, a final judgment on the merits had, before appeal. (Paddock v. Springfield &c. Ins. Co., 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 591.) Where a judgment directs a reference, and reserves further questions, until the coming in of the report, it is not final, and an appeal does not lie. (Harris v. Clark [Ct. of Appeals], 4 How. 78; Cruger v. Douglass, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 571; C7ittenden v. Miss. Soc. [Ct. of Appeals], 8 How. 327.) So while a question, to determine which was one of the objects of the suit, remains in part undecided, and may be litigated under the provisions of thejudgment, such judgment is not final, and no appeal will lie therefrom. (Tompkins v. Hyatt, 19 N. Y. 534.),An order setting aside an answer as frivolous, and that the plaintiff have judgment as for want of an answer, and also that the defendant submit to examination on oath concerning his property, and the judgment to be given on the complaint, is not the final judgment in the action, and is not, therefore, appealable to this court, (Dunham v. Niclwlson [Ot. of Appeals], 4 How. 140.),But a decree reserving no questions, though not final while questions may arise under a reference ordered by it, becomes final upon confirmation of the report. (Swart 7hout v. Curtis, 4 N. Y. [4 Comst.] 415.),The holder of a fund, being sued by two parties who had conflicting claims thereto, brought the same into court, and was discharged from litigation under Â§ 122 of the Code, but without any formal substitution of either claimant as defendant. A reference was then ordered under Â§ 271, subd. 3, to ascertain the facts, and upon the

It was held that the order of the general term affirming the award of the fund was appealable to this court, as in sub- stance a judgment. (Kirby v. Fitzpatric7c, 18 N. Y. 484.),Jurdgment of special term.]-An appeal lies to this court from a judgment at a special term, without any intermedi- ate appeal to the general term, if the issues had been so fully decided by the general term, on a prior appeal fiom an order, that an appeal to it from the judgment would be a mere formality. (Cook v. N. Y. Floating Dry Dock Co., 18 N. Y. 229; but see contra, Hollister Bank v. Tail, 15,. Y. 593.) Orders before judgment.]-An appeal will lie from any order which virtually determines the action, and prevents a judgment fiom which an appeal might be taken; and fiom an order granting or refusing a new trial (Code, Â§ 11); but from no other order whatever, made before judgment.,Even an order for judgment (DunthaWm v. Nicholson [Ct. of Appeals], 4 How. 140), or striking out an answer as sham or irrelevant (Briggs v. Bergen, 23 N. Y. 162), or striking out an answer amended of course (Sac7ett's Har- bor Bank v. Burwell [Ct. of Appeals], 9 How. 95), is not appealable.,In partition suits, therefore, the appeal should be delayed until after the entry of the judgment maing partition. An appeal will not lie from an order declaring the rights of the parties, and appointing commissioners to make partition. (Beebe v. Griffing, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 465.) An order refusing a stay of proceedings, leave to move to set aside the report of a referee without an ap- peal, or for extension of time to appeal (Enos v. Thomas [Ct. of Appeals], 5 How. 359); or denying an applica- tion for a rehearing (Mayor &c. of N. Y. v. Schermerhorn, 1 N. . [1 Comst.] 424); an order granting, continuing or vacating a temporary injunction ('an Dewater v. lelsey,,939

S. 415); o: vacating an order of reference to ascertain the amount of damages caused by an injunction (Anon. [Ct. of Ap- peals], 4 How. 80); or removing an action to a United States court, on the ground that the defendant is a citi- zen of another state (Illius v. N.Y. & N. Haven 1?. R., 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 597); is not appealable to this court.,An order of the general term dismissing an appeal from a judgment at special term, on the ground that it was too late, is appealable to this court. (Bates v. Yoorlhees, 20 N. Y. 525.),Orders after judgmenet.]-An appeal lies to this court, as we have already said (ante, p. 937), from a final order, affecting a substantial right, made in a summary applica- tion after judgment. (Code, Â§ 11.),Under this provision it has been repeatedly held that no order is appealable which does not assume the validity of the judgment, and is not based upon it. (Bank of Genesee v. Spencer, 18 N. Y. 150; Jones v. Derby, 16 id. 242; Humntlhrey v. Chamberlain, 11 id. [1 Kern.] 274; Dunlop v. Edwards, 3 id. [3 Comst.] 341; Sherman v. Felt, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 186; 3 How. 425; Ttompson v. Bullock [Ct. of Appeals], 16 How. 213; see M'Gregor v. Comstock, 19 N. Y. 581.) But an appeal lies from an order made after judgment rendered upon the striking out of an answer as sham, where such order vacates the judgment upon the ground that the plaintiff's cause of action has been destroyed by events occurring between the time of striking out the answer and the actual entry of judgment. (Edson v. Dillaye, 17 N. Y. 158.) And it is difficult to reconcile this case (which it is clear was rightly decided on this point) with the very broad language of some of the preceding cases, since it is obvious that the order below did not assume the cor- rectness of the judgment. The decisions (not the dicta)

Orders afterjudgment. may be reconciled by considering that the order in this case finally disposed of the whole controversy, which the orders in the other cases did not.,An order of the general term striking costs out of a judgment (ThLompnso v. Blllock [Ct. of Appeals], 16 How. 213); or vacating a judgment on grounds of favor or irre- gularity (Jones v. Derby; iHumphrey v. Chamberlain; Slwrmco v. Felt, supra; Carpenter v. Carpenter, 4 How. 139); or refusing to do so (Dtinlop v. Edwards, supra); or vacating a judgment in an action for land, under the provisions of the Revised Statutes, vol. 2, p. 309 (Evans v. Millard, 16 N. Y. 619); or refusing to set aside an execu- tion irregularly issued (Bank of Genesee v. Spencer, 18 N. Y. 150), is not appealable to this court.,No appeal will lie from an order of the general term reversing an order of the special term, which permitted the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, after having given judgment dismissing the complaint witlhout preju- dice to the plaintiff's right to bring a new action; and this notwithstanding the order of the special term was not properly appealable. (iV. Y. Ice Co. v. North Western Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296.) An appeal lies from an order requiring a person, bene- ficially interested in a recovery sought to be had in the name of another, to pay the costs of the defendant in the action. (Giles v. Halbert, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 32.) An order vacating an entry of satisfaction of judg- ment is appealable, and this although the judgment was only for costs. (l:tGregor v. Comstoc7k, 19 N. Y. 581.) An order, refusing leave to issue execution after the lapse of five years from judgment, is appealable. (Betts v. Garr, 26 N. Y. 383.) Discretionary orders.]-Orders as to matters which rest in the discretion of the court below are not appealable. (]Walkeman v. Price, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.l 334; Hazleton v. Wakeman [Ct. of Appeals], 3 How. 357, and see ante, p.,941
What is appealable. Special proceedings. 886.) Thus, no appeal lies from an order denying a motion to set aside a default. (Spaulding v. Kingsland, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 426); or relieving from imprisonment for contempt (People v. Delvecchio, 18 N. Y. 352); or denying leave to file exceptions to the report of a referee; after the time for doing so had expired (King v. The Merchants' Excthange Co., 5 N. Y. [1 Seld.] 547); or opening a foreclosure sale on the ground of inadequacy of price. (Buffilo Savings Bank v. Newton, 23 N. Y. 160.),An order, under the old equity practice, granting or refusing a feigned issue (Candee v. Lord, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 269), or granting or refusing a new trial after verdict on a feigned issue (Lansing v. Russell, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 563), was not appealable to this court for this reason.," Conclusive" decrees.]-Where a statute provides (as do the statutes relative to opening streets in the city of New York, and those in reference to the taking of lands for plank roads and railroad corporations) that the order or decision of the Supreme Court shall be final and conclusive, no appeal lies from such decision to the Court of Appeals. (Matter of Canal and Walker streets, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 406; McAllister v. Albion Plan*k Road Co., 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 353; 7 How. 301; N. Y. Central B. 1. v. lMar- vin, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 276.),Special proceedings.]-An appeal lies to this court, as we have already mentioned (ante, p. 937), from the final order of a general term in a special proceeding; subject to the usual restrictions in the case of proceedings com- menced in inferior courts not of record.,But no proceeding in the course of an action is a spe- cial proceeding, witlin the meaning of the Code. (Ct. of Appeals, Genin v. Tompkins, Code Rep. N. S. 415.),An application, by petition to the Supreme Court, to compel a specific performance by infant heirs of a con- tract made by the ancestor, is a special proceeding, and
What is appealable. Special proceedings. an appeal lies from a final order affecting a substantial right made at general term upon such an application, e.g., an order compelling the purchaser to take a conveyance, executed under the directions of the court. (Hyatt v. Seeley, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 52.) Where an order or decree of a surrogate, admitting a will to probate, is reversed by the Supreme Court upon a question of fact, and an issue is awarded to be tried at the circuit, no appeal lies to this court, for the reason that the order of the Supreme Court is not final. The matter is still pending in that court, and may be again brought before the general term, upon exceptions taken at the trial or after motion to set aside the verdict. (Talbot v. Talbot, 23 N. Y. 17.) But it is otherwise where the Supreme Court reverses the order for error in law, and remits the proceedings back to the surrogate. The order of reversal in such a case is a final determination of the proceeding in the Supreme Court, and therefore appealable. (Ib.; Messerve v. Sutton, 3 N. Y. [3 Comst.] 546; Wagnler v. Beiley [Ot. of Appeals], 4 How. 195.) But if an order of the subordinate court is affirmed by the Supreme Court, it must have been final, or an appeal will not lie. Thus no appeal lies from an order of the Supreme Court, affirm- ing the order of a surrogate refusing leave to discontinue an accounting, and directing the hearing to proceed. The parties must proceed to a final determination in the Sur- rogate's Court. (Tompkins v. Soulice [Ct. of Appeals], 7 How. 194.),On a certiorari to review the proceedings of commis- sioners of assessment, &c., the granting or refusal of the writ is in the discretion of the court, and therefore no appeal will lie from an order quashing the writ as improv- idently granted. (People v. Stilhell, 19 N. Y. 531; Matter of Mount Morris Square, 2 Hill, 28; People v. Supervisors of Allegihany, 15 Wend. 206.) It seems, however, that a formal judgment affirming or annulling the proceedings,943
-- What is appealable. Appeals from justices below, would involve the legal merits of the case, and be a proper subject of appeal. (People v. Stiltwell, supra.),An appeal will lie from an order of the general term denying an application for admission to practice as an attorney and counsellor at law. (Matter of Cooper, 22 N. Y. 67; S. C., 11 Abb. 301; reversing Matter of the Gra. duates, 31 Barb. 353; 10 Abb. 348; id. 357; 19 How. 136.) ART. 2.-Applieals to tlhe court of apl)leals from justices',judgments. In an action originally commenced before a justice of the peace, or in the marine court of the city of New York, or in an assistant justice's court of that city, or in a jus- tice's court of any of the cities of this state, an appeal may be taken in the like cases as in actions commenced in courts of record, provided the general term from which the appeal is to be taken, by order duly entered, allows such appeal before the end of the next term after which its judgment was entered. (Code, Â§ 11.),These restrictions do not extend to actions discontinued before a justice of the peace, upon a plea of title, and commenced in another court, pursuant to % 60 and 68 of the Code. (Id.); but they do apply to every action origin- ally commenced in a justice's court, removed in any other way into another court. No appeal, therefore, lies from stthe judgment of the N. Y. Common Pleas, in an action removed into it from a district court of that city under Laws of 1857, ch. 344, without an order of the general term allowing such appeal. (Smith v. White, 23 N. Y. 572.),The N. Y. Common Pleas will not allow an appeal to the Court of Appeals in such actions indiscriminately, even where questions of law are involved. Where a judgment of the marine court was sustained at general term of that court, and affirmed by the Common Pleas, it was held that an appeal to the Court of Appeals should

Jack7son, 14 How. 230); and so, where a case involving the same question (it being one of practice only, and not involving a substantial right) had been previously permitted to go to the Court of Appeals (Palmer v. 3focller, 2 Hilt. 421; S. 0., 9 Abb. 20 note; 19 How. 322); but where the decision of the Com- mon Pleas was in direct conflict with a decision of the general term of the Supreme Court in the same district, leave was given to appeal. (Clapp v. Graves, 2 Hilt. 243.),Order, wvhen to be mad(c.]-The time fixed by the Code for allowing these appeals cannot be enlarged, directly or indirectly. (PWait v. Van Allen, 22 N. Y. 319.) The gene- ral term have therefore no power to allow such an appeal by an order entered at any time after the end of the general term next after the entry of judgment, and this notwithstanding the motion for such leave was made in time, and the delay is the fault of the court. (Ib.; over- ruling Clapp v. Graves, 2 Hilt. 317; 9 Abb. 20.) ART. 3.-Notice of appeal from order granting new trial. A notice of appeal to this court from an order granting a new trial is a nullity, unless it contains a stipulation on the part of the appellant that if the order is affirmed, judgment absolute shall be rendered against him. (Code, Â§11.) If such order contains any reservation in favor of the appellant, he must renounce it. Thus, where the order directs a new trial unless the plaintiff will remit a part of his verdict, a notice of appeal by him, retaining the right of such election to remit, in case the order is affirmed, is void. (Lanman v. Leiviston R. R., 18 N. Y. 493.),Strictly speaking, this stipulation should be in the notice; but we suppose that if it is annexed to the notice, it would suffice (see Cook v. Kelsey, 19 N. Y. 412), though we by no means advise such a course. Clearly, if not served with the notice, both would be void.,119,945
What may be reviewed. Questions of fact.,ART. 4.-WhTat may lbe revic wced. The general principles which govern this court, in corn. mon with others, upon this subject, have been already stated. (Ante, ppl. 911, 924.) But there are some rules peculiar to this court, and limiting its powers of review, which must be noticed here,,Excepltions.]-Only such questions of law as were pro- perly raised by exceptions in the court below, will be reviewed on appeal from a judgment of affirmance (Inger- soll v. Bostwick, 22 N. Y. 425; Otis v. Spencer, 16 id. 610; M3agie v. Bak7er, 14 N. Y. 435; Huntt v. Bloomer, 13 N.Y. [3 Kern.] 341; Stewart v. Smith, 14 Abb. 75); unless they are of such a nature that the objections involved could not have been obviated, if made at the trial. (Ante, p. 913.),On an appeal from a judgment reversing that of the special term (Mlarquat v. Marquat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336), and on an appeal from an order, no exceptions are necessary. (Marshall v. Smith, 20 N. Y. 251.),Questions of fact.]-This court has no power to review questions of fact, upon an appeal from a judgment entered upon the verdict of a jury (Dain v. Wyc7off, 18 N. Y. 45; Oldfield v. 2. Y. & Harlem. Z. B., 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 310; Keller v. N. Y. Central B. B. [Ct. of Appeals], 24 How. 472; White v. Douglass, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 564), or on the decision of a judge without a jury (Newton v. Bronson, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 587; Pratt v. Foote, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 463; see Dlunham v. Watkins, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 556), or on the report of a referee (Gr'iscom v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 586; Western v. Genlesee Mlut. Ins. Co., id. 258; Brainerd v. . Y. & Hiar7em R. ., 25 NT.

[1 Kern.] 170); except where a judgment entered upon the decision of a judge without ajury, or of a referee, has been reversed
What may be reviewed. Questions of fact. by the general term upon a question of fact, and the judg- ment of reversal so states. (Code, % 268, 272.),Unless it is stated in the judgment of reversal that it was determined upon a question of fact, it is to be deemed that it was not based upon that ground (MI.), and this court must assume that the facts were correctly found by the special term or referee (Barlow v. Scott, 24 N. Y. 40), and must confine its review to the questions of law. (Story v. Ft urman, 25 N. Y. 214.),Though the general term put its decision upon the ground that the evidence was not conflicting, this court will not, it seems, review it any further than to see that there was some evidence to sustain the judgment. (Terry v. Whoeeler, 25 N. Y. 520.),The court will not, except in the special cases men- tioned, look beyond the findings of facts contained in the case, in order to draw any inferences of fact bearing upon the appeal (Stewart v. Smith [Ct. of Appeals], 14 Abb. 75), except for the purpose of giving a construction to an ambiguous finding of fact. (Spencer v. Ballou, 18 N. Y. 327; Carman v. Putlt, 21 id. 547; see Terry v. Wheeler, 25 id. 520.),Neither can this court review the determination of the court below on questions of fact, on an appeal from an order granting a new trial (Hoyt v. Thompson, 19 N. Y. 207; Miller v. Sc7hiyler, 20 id. 522; Moore v. Westervelt, Code Rep. N. S. 415), except so far as to see whether, in any possible aspect of the evidence, the order can be sustained (Ib.; Sanford v. Eighth7 Avenue B. B., 23 N. Y. 343); and except, also, in the same cases in which the facts are reviewable on appeal from a judgment. It was formerly the rule of the court to affirm the order, if there was any question of fact in the case upon which the court below might have reversed the judgment rendered upon the trial (Miller v. Schuyler, supra); but the amendments to Â§ 268 and Â§ 272 have doubtless changed this rule, except in actions tried before a jury.,947
What may be reviewed. The return. It will be observed that there is no possible form of judgment, or order for a new trial, under which this court can review questions of fact, where the cause was tried by a jury.,But on appeals from orders determining the action, and preventing a final judgment, questions of fact are review. able (Bates v. Yoorl7ees, 20 N. Y. 525); ; though it has been held otherwise on an appeal from an order for the distri- bution of surplus moneys, after judgment in an aztiou of foreclosure. (Marshall v. Smitt, 20 N. Y. 251.*),Questions of law.]-The decision of a question of fact by the court or a referee upon undisputed evidence (Pratt v. Foote, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 463), or upon a conceded state of facts (see Sanford v. Eighth Avenue R. 1., 23 N. Y. 343), or without evidence (Davis v. Spencer, 24 N. Y. 386), raises a pure question of law, reviewable in this court.,On special verdict.]-On appeal from a judgment entered on a special verdict, the court will look into the pleadings, and determine the appeal on the facts admitted by the pleadings, as well as those stated in the verdict. (Barto v. Himrod, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 483.),ART. 5.-The return. On every appeal to this court, a return must be pro- cured by the appellant from the court below. (Code, Â§ 328.),When the appeal is from a judgment, the return con- sists of certified copies oP the notice of appeal and judgment roll. When the appeal is from an order, the re- turn consists of certified copies of the notice of appeal, the order appealed from, and the papers upon which the order was granted. (Code, Â§ 328; Bule 1, Ct. of Appeals.) * It is not easy for us to reconcile these decisions. Marshall v. Smith was really little more than a dictum.
The return. Statement by general term. ;State7menit of facts by general term.]-On an appeal from a judgment of the general term, in an action tried other- wise than before a jury, the appellant may have the facts, upon which such judgment was based, settled for the purposes of such appeal. (Rule 38, Supreme Ct.) But such a finding of facts is not necessary in an action tried by the court (Code, Â§ 268); nor of any use whatever in any case except where the general term reverses the judgment below upon a question of fact, and so states in the judg- ment of reversal. In any other case, the Court of Ap- peals will not look at such a finding. (Ph7elps v. 21Donald, 26 N. . 82.),For the purpose of such settlement, in an action tried by the court or referees, the party must, within twenty days after notice of the judgment, propose and serve upon the opposite party such a statement of the facts as he deems proper. The party upon whom such statement is served may, within twenty days after such service, prepare such amendments to the statement as he may deem proper, which a ndmdments must be in writing and served on the moving party. The party preparing the original state- ment may give eight days' notice that the statements and amendments will be presented for settlement to the justice who delivered the opinion in the case; or, if no opinion was delivered, to the presiding justice of the court. Such justice will settle the facts; and upon the statement as settled by him, he will indorse an order that the statement beattached to the judgment roll. (Rule 38, Supreme Court.),Whenever a general term renders judgment upon a verdict taken subject to the opinion of the court, the questions or conclusions of law, together with a concise statement of the facts upon which they arose, must be prepared by and under the direction of the court, and filed with the judgment roll as a part thereof, for the purposes of a review in the Court of Appeals. (Code, Â§ 333.) But the only facts that the general term is authorized to state,949
- The return. Filing. Further return. under Â§ 333, are those uncontroverted and conceded at the trial. (Purchase v. Mattison [Ct. of Appeals], 15 Abb, 402; 25 N. Y. 211.),There is no rule prescribing how this statement of facts is to be prepared, but as it must be done before judgment is entered, it would seem proper to prepare and settle it in the same manner as a judgment containing special provisions.,Piling /retitrn.]-The appellant must cause the proper return to be made and filed with the clerk of this court, within twenty days after the appeal is perfected (Rule 2, Ct. of Appeals), that is, within twenty days after service of the notice of appeal, without regard to the time allowed for excepting to the sureties. (Tlhompsonl v. Blan clard, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 561.),It is the duty of the appellant, not only to apply to the clerk for the return, but to see that it is prepared in due form, and transmitted to the clerk of this court in due time. (Spoore v. Fannlan, 16 N. Y. 620.),For the proper course of proceeding on the part of the respondent, to dismiss the appeal where the return is not filed in time, see Art. 11 of this chapter; post, p. 960.,Instead of adopting that course, however, he may, after the lapse of the twenty days, procure the return himself. (Code, Â§ 328.*),Further return.]-If the return made by the clerk of the court below is defective, either party may, on an affi- davit specifying the defect, apply to one of the judges of this court for an order that the clerk make a further return without delay. (Rule 3, Ct. of Appeals.),If, therefore, part of the papers on which the order below was made are wanting, such omission may be ex- plained, and (unless arising from the misconduct of the,* As amended, 1863.
C~~ The appeal book. What it must contain. appellant) a further return ordered. (McG'regor v. Coni. stock, 19 N. Y. 581.),ART. 6.-The appeal book. In all calendar causes, a case must be made by the appellant, consisting of a copy of the return of the clerk, and the reasons of the court below for its judgment (including every opinion, whether at a general or special term, relating to the questions involved in the appeal), or an affidavit that the same cannot be procured. (Rule 5, Ct. of Appeals.) The written opinion of a referee, in which lhe assigned his reasons for his conclusions of fact and law, should be printed with the case. (WVarren v.War- ren, 22 How. 142.),If the case is voluminous, an index to the pleadings, exhibits, depositions, and other principal matters, must be added. (Rule 5, Ct. of Appeals.) It is more usual, and more convenient, to call this "case" the appeal book, because the clerk's return in- cludes the whole of the document technically called a case, and of this the opinions of the court below form no part. (Titus v. Orvis, 16 N. Y. 617; aagie v. Baker, 14 id. 435.),Prior to the amendments of 1860, it was well settled that an appeal book, on appeal from a judgment, must contain a case presenting the conclusions of fact and of law, and a proper statement of the questions presented, and of the exceptions to rulings. Without these, although it contained the pleadings, the referee's report, the judg- ment, and the notice of appeal, it presented no record into which the court could look for the reasons and ground of the judgment, or to find errors, if any there were, at the trial. (Otis v. Spencer, 16 N. Y. 610; 6 Abb. 127; 15 How. 425; Magie v. Baker, 14 N. Y. 435; Johnson v. W7dtlock, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 344; Hunt v. Bloomer, id. 341.) There must be a case made up, in order to review a judgment upon the report of a referee; even though the facts neces-,- 951

And after a trial by the court or referees, the case must contain not only the exceptions taken dur- ing the trial, but those taken afterwards, to the final decision of the cause. (Johnzson v. W7hitlocc, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 344; 12 How. 571; Hunt v. Bloomer, 13 N. Y. 341i 12 How. 567; Westcott v. Thomplsson, 16 N. Y. 613.),But now, when an appeal from a judgment entered on the report of a referee has been heard and decided at the general term, upon the report and exceptions, without a case containing the evidence, the decision may be re- viewed in like manner on appeal to the Court of Appeals. (Code, Â§ 272 ;* see Ferguson v. Hamilton, 35 Barb. 427.),On an appeal from a judgment entered upon a verdict, the exceptions, if they have been stated in a case with the evidence, must be separated by the court or a judge below, under Â§ 264, before bringing on the appeal. (Zabriskie v. Smitht, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 480.),But no exceptions are necessary on the part of an appellant who was successful at the trial, but against whom final judgment was rendered at general term, (Marqiuat v. Mllarqtat, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 336.),The appellant has no right, of his own motion, to make up a new case upon appeal to this court. The appeal must be heard upon the same case which was reviewed at the general term (Johnson v. Whitlock, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 344; 12 How. 571), unless by consent of the parties, or the order of the court below, it is amended by striking out such parts of the evidence as cannot bear upon the questions of law, or otherwise resettled so as to present those questions more clearly to the court. (Ib.),No finding of facts by the general term is required for the purpose of review in the Court of Appeals, where the cause was tried by the court (Code, Â§ 268); but if the,* As amended, 1860..

Otherwise they will not be there reviewed. (Smith v.

Pultz, 21 N. Y. 547; Re- formed Dutch Church v. Brown [Ct. of Appeals], 24 How. *76); and so if the papers fail to show whether the judg- ment appealed from was rendered at a special or general term (Darby v. Callaghan, 16 N. Y. 71); or if the record leaves some doubt as to whether the judgment of the general term was founded on an appeal regularly taken and argued (Beecher v.

Small pica is the smallest type allowed. (Rule 6, Ct. of Appeals.),Revision of a.?peal book.]-If the appeal book contains any irrelevant matter, such matter will be stricken out on motion. (Brown v.

(Rule 8, Ct. of Appeals, as recently amended.),Any party claiming a preference must so state in his notice of argument, and must also state the ground of such preference, so as to show to which of the classes of preferred cases the case belongs (Rule 23, Ct. of Appeals); and where the people are parties, the attorney for the state, if he claims a preference on that ground, must give notice of a motion to that effect, naming the day on which the case will be brought on, at the time he serves his notice of argument. (See Laws 1858, ch. 37.),Causes noticed and placed upon the calendar for the January term of any year, are considered as noticed for all the subsequent terms. (Rutle 24, Ct. of Appeals.),Â§328.

The calendar. How prepared.,ART. 8.--The calendar. Before a cause can be entered on the calendar, the fol- lowing requirements must be complied with: 1. The return must have been filed. (Refornmed Dutch Chutrch v. Brown [Ct. of Appeals], 24 How. 89.) 2. A copy of the notice of argument, specifying the judicial district in which the cause originated, must be furnished to the clerk eight days before the first day of the term. (Rule 8, Ct. of Appeals.) 3. There must also be filed with the clerk due proof or admission of the service of such notice of argument upon the adverse party. (Rule 27, Ct. of Appeals.) The clerk will then make a calendar of causes thus noticed, arranging them in the order in which the returns were filed, specifying the judicial district in which the causes originated respectively. (Rule 8, Ct. of Appeals.) On a second and each subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeals, or when an appeal has once been dismissed for defect or irregularity, the cause must be placed upon the calendar as of the time of filing the first appeal. (Code, g 13.*) The printed calendar for the January term will stand as the calendar for the entire year. After the January term in each year, no causes, except such as are by law entitled to a preference, can be placed upon the calendar without the direction of the court. (Rule 24, Ct. of Ap- peals.),All causes in which a re-argument is ordered may, at the election of either party, be placed on the calendar at the next term after such re-argument is ordered, or the following term, to take their original places on the calen- dar. (Rule 28, Ct. of Appeals.) *This part of the section is an amendment designed to supersede Crain v. Rowley (4 How. 79).,955
The calendar. Preferences. Exchanging cause Preferred causes.]-According to existing laws, causes which are preferred take their preference in the following order:,1. Criminal actions; 2. Cases of probate, in which the appeal prevents the issuing of letters testamentary, or of general administra. tion;,3. Appeals in which the sole plaintiffs or defendants are executors or administrators;,4. All other preferred cases. (Rule 23, Ct. of Appeals; see also Rule 13.),And an appeal in any action or proceeding in which the people, or any state officer, or any board of state officers, are sole plaintiffs or defendants, has a preference, and may be moved by either party out of its order on the calendar. (Code, Â§ 13.) Any party claiming a preference must so state in his notice of argument to the opposite party and to the clerk; and he must also state the ground of such preference, so as to show to which of the above classes the case belongs. In making up the calendar, the clerk will place the preferred causes at the head, in the order above described. A preferred cause being once passed without reservation, will take its place, in subse- quent calendars, without preference. (Rule 23, Ct. of Ap peals.),Exchanging causes.]-Causes upon -the calendar may be exchanged one for another, of course, on filing with the clerk in court a note of the proposed exchange with the numbers of the causes, signed by the respective attorneys or counsel. Upon all subsequent calendars, each of such causes will take the place due to the date of the filing of the return in the other. (Rule 20, Ct. of Appeals.),Striking off causes.]-Any cause, except the first ten upon the calendar, may be struck therefrom before it is reached, of course, and without prejudice, by the clerk in 956
The calendar. Call and changes. The argument. court, on consent of the parties who placed the same upon the calendar, at any time during the first week of the term. (Rule 20, Ct. of Appeals.) Causes thus struck off are not included in the ten called each day under the rule. (See 7 How. 240.) call of calendar.]-Ten causes only will be called on any day, but after such call, causes ready on both sides will be heard in their order. Aly cause which is regularly called and passed, without postponement by the court for good cause shown, at the time of the call, will be placed on all subsequent calendars as if the return had been filed on the day when it was so passed. (Rule 20, Ct. of Appeals.) The call of the calendar at the second, and each subse- quent term in the year, will commence at the point where it terminated at the previous term. Causes which are passed, and which, of consequence, go to the foot of the calendar, will resume their original places upon the calen- dar for the ensuing year. (Rule 26, Ct. of Appeals.) Changes in the caleildar.]-Tlhe chief judge has control of the calendar. All propositions in reference to the arrangement or disposition of causes should be addressed to him. (7 How. 240.) If the attorney waits till the last day but one, before sending his notice of argument to the clerk for filing, he will not be allowed to put it on after that time, though then prevented by sudden and violent illness. (Wilkin v. Pearce [Ot. of Appeals], 4 How. 26.),ART. 9.-The argumenlt. Where both sides appear.]-At the commencement of the argument, the appellant must furnish a printed copy of the case to each of the judges, and six other copies to the clerk. Each party must, at the same time, furnish to each of the judges a printed copy of the points on which he intends to rely, with a reference to the author- ity which he intends to cite, and must deliver six other,957
The argument. On appeannlce. On default. copies to tle clerk, and three copies to the counsel of the adverse party. (Rlul 9, Ct. of Appeals.),In all cases each party must briefly state upon his printed points the leading facts which lhe deems estab. lished, with a reference to the folios where the evidence of such facts may be found. And the court will not hear an extended discussion upon any mere question of fact. (Rule 10, Ct. of Appeals.),In the argument of calendar causes and motions, only one counsel will be heard on each side, unless the court shall otherwise direct (Rule 12, Ct. of A.ppeals); and not more than two hours may be occupied by each counsel iu the argument of a cause, except by tile express permission of the court. (Rule 22, Ct. of Appeals.),WI7ere a party fails to appear.]-Judgmenyt by default is not allowed. When a cause is called in its order upon the calendar, it must be either argued, submitted or passed. If either party appears alone, he may, at his option, be heard orally, or submit the case upon his print. ed brief.,The party thus appearing and arguing, or submitting his case, must hand to the cleric a printed copy of his brief, to be delivered, whenever called for, to the opposite party, who may, at any time within twenty days after the hearing, furnish each member of the court, and serve upon the opposite party, a printed answer to such brief, which may be replied to, in like manner, at any time within fifteen days after such service. (Rule 25, Ct. of Appeals.),If the appellant only appears, le must furnish tlhe court witl the usual number of printed copies of the case, and of his points; if the respondent, he must hand to the court the copies of the case served upon him, and four. teen printed copies of his points. (Id.),Sullbmission on, printed alrgumenlts.]-Causes which hae not been exchanged, may be submitted at any time in 958
Judgment. Dismissal of appeal. terl on printed arguments. Exchanged causes cannot be submitted until reached upon the calendar. (Ritf 14, Ct. of Appeals.),ART. 10.--J'udgment. The concurrence of five judges is necessary to prc- nouncc a judgment. If five do not concur, tle case nust be reheard. And if, on a second rehearing, five judges do not concur, the judgmlent is affirmed. (Code, Â§ 14.),The opinions delivered by the judges are handed to the reporter, not to the clerk.,Cases argued or submitted, are usually decided at the close of the next succeeding term. (See 7 How. 240.),ART. 11.-Dismissal of (peiaL. On miotion.I.]-The cases in which, upon1 general princi- ples, an appeal should be dismissed, have already been stated. (Ante, p. 915.) But in addition to these causes of dismissal, there are some vwhich are peculiar to this court. Thus, if the appellant, without leave of the court below, preltares and presents on appeal a different case from that presented and acted upon at the general term, tile appeal should be dismissed. (Johnsont v. WV7it7ock, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 344.) And if, upon apl)eal from judgment on a verdict, the whole matter is brought up on a case, without separating the exceptions from the mass of useless mat- ter, the court will enforce the proper practice, by dismiss- ing tlhe appeal. (Zabris7ie v. Snith, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 480.) If the appeal appears to have been brought to this court directly from a special term, it will be dismissed; but the fact that the record leaves some doubt as to whether the judgment of the general term was founded on an appeal regularly taken and argued, is not sufficient ground for dismissal. (Beec7er v. Coinradt [Ct. of Appeals], 11 Blow. 181.),959
Dismissal of appeal. Dismissal ex parte. Dismissal ex l1arte.]-If the appellant fails to cause the proper return to be made and filed with the clerk of the Court of Appeals, within twenty days after the appeal is perfected; or if he fails to serve three printed copies of the case on the attorney of the adverse party within forty days after the 5ame period, the respondent may, by notice in writing, require such return to be filed, or such service to be made, within ten days after service of such notice; and if such notice is not complied with, in either case the appellant is deemed to have waived the appeal; and, on an affidavit proving the time when the appeal was perfec't- ed, and the service of such notice, and, in the former case, on a certificate of the clerk that no return has been filed, or in the latter case, on an affidavit proving the de- fault, the respondent may enter an order with the clerk dismissing the appeal for want of prosecution, with costs; and the court below may thereupon proceed as thougl: there had been no appeal. (Rules 2 and 7, of Ct. Appeals,),An ex parte dismissal is not allowed where an implerfect case has been served. The respondent in such case must apply to the court by motion, upon notice. He is at lihelTty to dismiss the appeal by alxarte order under Rule 7, only where there is a total failure to serve any case within the time required. (Bowers v. Tallmadge, 23 N. Y. 166; 20 How. 516.) And it is to be presumed that under Rule 2, also, an ex parte order can be obtained only where there is absolutely no return filed. In other cases, however imperfect the return, the remedy of the respondent must be by means of a special motion, on notice.,If the respondent neglects to enter his ex parte order after default made, he cannot raise the objection subse quently to the actual filing of the return, and service of the case; and still less if he has himself noticed the appeal for argument. (Beecier v. Conradt [Ct. of Appeals], 11 How. 181.)
Dismissal of appeal. Restoring appeal. Restoring appeals dismissed.]-Before the amendment of 1858, the right to enter this order of dismissal was abso- lute, and exercised without notice. Under this rule appli- cations to the court to be let in to file a return after the dismissal of a return, became very frequent; and the prac- tice became established that, if the appeal appeared to have been brought in good faith, the court would, without any special excuse, set aside the dismissal, and reinstate the appeal. (Spoore v. Fannan, 16 N. Y. 620; Thompson v. Blanchard, 2 N.Y. [2 Comst.] 561; Waterman v. Whitney [Ct. of Appeals], 7 How. 407.) To render these applica- tions unnecessary, the rule was amended by providing that the respondent should give ten days' notice that he required the return to be filed, before he could dismiss the appeal for want of a return. (Spoore v. Fannan., 16 N. Y. 620.) The court, therefore, will not now listen to any excuses which are not of a very substantial and meritorious nature.,Where the appellant now receives the proper notice, he must see to it that the notice is complied with, or must procure an order extending the time. (Ib.),In order to reinstate an appeal dismissed under Rule 2, the appellant must establish a clear case of diligence on his part, by showing that he had informed the clerk of the time when the return was to be filed, paid him his fees for making the return, and received his promise to make and file the return in time. (Spoore v. Pannan, 16 N. Y. 620.) After a remittitur had been actually filed below, it was held even under the old practice that a motion to rein- state an appeal came too late. (Dresser v. Brooks, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 559.) And a default would not be opened in the case of an appeal clearly untenable. (Sackett's Harbor Bank v. Bur- well [at. of Appeals], 9 How. 95.),121,961
Remittitur. When court loses jurisdiction,ART. 12.-Renmittitur. The Court of Appeals does not enforce its own judg- ments, but they are remitted to the courts below, to be enforced according to law. (Code, Â§ 12.),In. what cases.]-A remittitur is proper whenever any order is made which finally disposes of the appeal, though it may not be an order on the merits (Dresser v. Brools, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 559; 4 How. 207), e. g., an order dis- missing the appeal, after a return has been filed (Ib.; Langle.y v. Warner, 2 Code R. 97); but not where an appeal is dismissed, under Rule 2, for want of a return, for there is no record to remit. A certified copy of the order of dismissal is all that is necessary in such a case. (See TZho1mpson v. Blanchard, 4 How. 211, and note.),Forme and contents.]--The remittitur must contain a copy of the judgment of this court, and the return made by the clerk of the court below, and must be scaled with the seal, and signed by the clerk of this court.) Rule 16, Ct. of Appeals.),W7ten the court loses jtlrisdiction.]-The effect of a remit- titur, when regular, is to put an end to the jurisdiction of the appellate court (Dresser v. Brooks, 2 NI Y. [2 Comst.] 559; 4 How. 207), as soon as it is properly filed in the court below (lb.; Martin v. Wilson, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 240; Burcle v. Luce, id. 239; Frazer v. Western [Ct. of Ap- peals], 3 How. 235; Latson v. Wallace, [Ct. of Appeals], 9 How. 334); and the appellate court can make no further order in the cause. (Ib.; Iiegg v. Overbagh [Ct. of Errors], 4 Wend. 188; Delaplaine v. Bergen, 7 Hill, 591.),But the Court of Appeals does not lose jurisdiction while the order of dismissal is retained in counsel's hands (Thompson v. Blanchard, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 561); nor until it is filed below. (Burecle v. Luce, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 239.) 962
Remittitur. When court loses jurisdiction. The court may modify its decree while the remittitur is in transitu, and before it is actually received and acted upon by the court below; and such modification is to be deemed a recall of the remittitur, even though the attor- ney had filed it before he had notice of the modification (Iosack v. Rogers, 7 Paige, 108); but in the case cited, the modification had been made, and order issued to stay the filing of the original decree, before such filing had been made; and the practice of chancery was settled as re- quiring the party receiving the remnittitur, before filing it, to present it to the chancellor, ex parte, to enable him to see whether anything special was required, or to give notice to the adverse party of his intention to file it and ask for an order or decree thereupon. (lb.) Where the re- mittitur does not correctly state the judgment pronounced by the court, it may be amended upon motion, although filed below. (Palber v. Lawrence, 5 N. . [1 Seld.] 455.) If an order of dismissal is irregularly entered, or entered upon a false affidavit, the appellate court may vacate the order and reinstate the appeal; and the court below will thereupon, on motion, vacate the judgment on the reinittitur. (Newton v. Harris, sp. t., 8 Barb. 306; 1 Code Rep. N. S. 191.) So, where a decree of reversal had been entered by default, without service of any notice of the appellant's proceedings, the court set aside the decree of reversal for irregularity; although the decree had been entered, and the record remitted back to chancery (Waters v. Travis [Ct. of Errors], 8 Johns. 566); but a default regularly taken, though abundantly excused, cannot be opened after filing in the court below. (Latson v. Wallace [Ct. of Appeals], 9 How. 334.) Proceedings in the court below.]-The court below has jurisdiction as soon as the remittitur has been issued and delivered to the prevailing party, although it has not been filed. (Judson, v. Gray [Ct. of Appeals], 17 How. 290.),963
Remittitur. Proceedings in court below. The court of chancery required the party receiving the remittitur from the court of errors, to present it to the chancellor before it was filed, or to give notice of his intention to file it and ask a decree thereupon. (Hosack v. Rogers, 7 Paige, 108.),The remittitur should be filed, when received, with the clerk of the court below, and notice of such filing should be served upon the adverse party.,In case, however, of a judgment or an order which requires further action of the court below, the matter must be presented to the court upon motion, and a suit- able order applied for. (Union India Rubber Co. v. Babcock, 4 Duer, 620; 1 Abb. 262.) Upon such motion, the court will grant the order asked for; or if, on examination of the remlittitur, the court deem a notice proper, it will issue an order to show cause why the judgment of the court of appeals shoul( not be made the judgment of the court, &c. (Ib.) Or the prevailing party may give notice of his application for judgment in the first instance. (Hosatkl v. Rogers, 7 Paige, 108.),This order in the court below, where no other proceed- ings are required to carry out the judgment, is a mere formality, the want of which may be disregarded or sup- plied at any time. (Clhautaluqua Bank v. White, 23 N. Y. 347; overruling in effect Seacord v. AMorgan, 17 How. 394.),When, upon an appeal from an order granting a new trial, the court of appeals determine that no error was committed in granting the new trial, and render judg- ment absolute against the appellant, an assessment of damages or other proceedings to render the judgment effectual, may be had in the court from which the appeal was taken, after the proceedings are remitted thereto, in cases where such subsequent proceedings are requisite.

(Jarvis v. Shaw, sp. t., 16 Abb. 415.) But if it appears that a judge of the court of appeals has granted an order that the remittitur be stayed, " if not already sent down," until a motion for re-argument can be heard, the filing should be stayed, so as to give the order of the judge the same effect that it would have had, if the remit- titur had not been sent down. (Ib.),Vacating or modlifing rem)ittitir or judgimen t.]-A remit- titur regularly filed in the court below, will not be taken off after an order to execute the judgment of the appel- late court has been entered, without a suggestion of the higher court that the remittitur does not conform to its judgment, or has been irregularly issued. (Bogardus v. Rosendalek anufiacturing Co., 1 Duer, 592; Selden v. Ver- milyea, 3 Sands. 683; Newton v. Harris, sp. t., 8 Barb. 306.) Such suggestion of the court of appeals must be in official form, as by resolution, duly certified by the clerk and communicated to the court below; and there- upon the judgment on the remittitur will be vacated on motion. (lb.),The court below has no power to correct any errors of jurisdiction of the appellate court in making the decree (Rogers v. Paterson, 4 Paige, 409), nor any other error which might have been brought before that court (Gris-,965
-_ Remittitur. Interlocutory proceedings. wuold v.

Ex parte orders.]-The time prescribed by the rules for doing any act may be enlarged, by the court, or by any of the judges thereof. And any one of the judges may make orders to stay proceedings, which, when served, with papers and notice of motion, stay the proceedings according to the terms of the order. And any order may be revoked or modified by the judge who made it, or, in case of his absence or inability to serve, by any of the other judges. (Rale 18, Ct. of Appeals.),Motions.]-Motions will be heard on the morning of the first day, and on the morning of each following Tuesday and Friday during the tern, before taking up the calendar. (Rule 15, Ct. of Appeals.),Where notice has been given of a motion, if no one appears to oppose, it will be granted as of course. (Id.) If a motion is not made on the day for which it has been noticed, the opposing party will be entitled, on applying to the court at the close of the motions for that day, to a rule denying the motion, with costs.

The argument. 6. Principles of determination. 7. Entry of.the decision. AlT. 1.-When an a)ppeal will lie. An appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from the judgment of a county court, or of a mayor's or recorder's court (Code, Â§ 344), or of the city court of Brooklyn. (Laws 1849, ch7. 125.),An appeal lies to the general term of any court of record, in which there is a general term, from the judg- ment entered upon the verdict of a jury, the decision of a single judge, or the report of a referee in the same court. (Code, Â§ 348.),The judgments which are thus appealable are of the same character as those which are appealable to the Court of Appeals. A decree which is not absolutely final, dis- posing of all questions in the cause, is not appealable as a judgment, though it may be as an order, in certain cases. (Lawrence v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 15 How. 57; Lawrence v. Fowler, 20 id. 407; M'MJaon. v. Allen, 7 Abb. 1; see Griffin v. Cranston, 5 Bosw. 658; Heinemann v. Waterbury, 5 Bosw. 686.),An appeal may be taken from a judgment upon a ver diet, without any previous motion for a new trial. (Morange v. Morris, 32 Barb. 651; 12 Abb. 164; 20 How. 257; Morrison v. N. . & N. Haven B. R. Co., 32 Barb. 568.) 'This chapter has no bearing upon appeals from the judgment of a county court, affirming or reversing that of a justice of the peace.,967
What may be reviewed.. On appeal from verdict,ART. 2.-Wlat may be reviewed. Exceptions necessary.]--No question of law arising upon the trial or decision can be reviewed, unless upon excep- tions duly taken. (Cheesebrough v. Agate, 26 Barb. 603; 7 Abb. 32.),On appeal from inferior court.]-On an appeal to the Supreme Court from the judgment of an inferior court, nothing but errors of the court can be reviewed. (Thurber v. Townsend, 22 N. Y. 517.) The appellate court cannot reverse the judgment on the ground that the damages are excessive (ib.), or that the verdict was contrary to evi- dence. The only errors of fact into which it can inquire are those of the court, and not of the jury. (Ib.),On appeal from verdict.]-On an appeal to the general term from a judgment of the same court upon a verdict, questions of law only are reviewable (Code, Â§ 348), upon exceptions duly taken (Brown v. Richardson, 1 Bosw. 402; Morrison v. N. . . H& . aven R. R. Co., 32 Barb. 568; Keyes v. Devlii, 3 E. D. Smith, 518), or upon the plead- ings. (See Rankci v. Pine, 4 Abb. 309; Robinson v. BHid. River R. R. Co., 1 Hilt. 144; 3 Abb. 115; MLills v. Thlrsby, 12 How. 385; 2 Abb. 432; Brown v. Harris, 9 How. 345.),The finding of a jury can only be reviewed by means of a motion for a new trial; and an appeal from the order thereon. (Marquart v. Lafarge, 5 Duer, 559.),On an appeal from a judgment on a verdict, the court cannot inquire whether the verdict was against the weight of evidence, or whether the damages awarded were exces- sive. (Bulkely v. Keteltas, 4 Sands. 450; Bedell v. Conmmer. cial Ins. Co., 3 Bosw. 147; Rider v. Union India Rubber Co., 4 Bosw. 169; Anttony v. Smith, 4 Bosw. 503; Ogden v. Coddington, 2 E. D. Smith, 317; Fry v. Bennett, 16 How. 385; 7 Abb. 352; see Hastings v. McKinley, 3 Code Rep. 10; Morrison v. N. Y. & N. Haven R. R., 32 Barb. 568.) 968
What may be reviewed. Papers on appeal. But when a fact is found without any evidence tending to sustain such a conclusion, the error is one of law, which may always be reviewed. (Gage v. Parker, 25 Barb. 141; see ante, p. 948.),On appeal from special termn.]-On appeal from a judg- ment entered upon the decision of a judge without a jury, to the general term of the same court, questions of fact as well as of law arc reviewable (Code, Â§ 348); and the judgment may be reversed as against the weight of evi- dence. (Griffin v. Marquardt, 17 N. Y. 28; Thompson v. bencek, 22 How. 431; see Smith v. Schanck, 18 Barb. 344.),On appeal from referee's decisioin.J-On an appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee, to the general term of the court which appointed him, questions of fact as well as of law are reviewable in like manner as upon appeal from the judgment of a special term. (Code, 348.),ART. 3.-Papers on appeal. Retutrn.]-On an appeal from an inferior court to the Supreme Court, the clerk with whom the notice of appeal is filed must, at the expense of the appellant, transmit a return to the appellate court, of precisely the same nature as that which is required on an appeal to the Court of Appeals (Code, Â§ 328); and if, within twenty days after the appeal is perfected, the appellant does not cause this to be done, the respondent may do so. (Id.*) See on the subject of this return, ante, p. 950.) Appeal boo0k.]-On an appeal to the general term under 6 348 of the Code, an appeal book must be prepared, con- sisting of a copy of the judgment roll, together with a case, stating the time of the commencement of the suit, and of the service of the respective pleadings, the names,* As amended, 1863. 122,969

Care. of the original parties in fill, and the change of parties, if any has taken place pending the suit; to which must be added the opinion of the court below, or an affidavit that no opinion in writing was given, or if given, that a copy could not be procured. (Rule 43, Supreme Court.),If the cause was tried by a referee, his written opinion, if any, should be printed in the appeal book. (Warren v. Warren, 22 How. 142.),Case.]-To entitle the appellant to review any questions, either of fact or of law, arising upon the trial or decision, a case containing exceptions, regularly settled and filed, is indispensable. (Conolly v. Conoily, 16 How. 224.),Neglect to file this case within tell days after it has been settled, finally disposes of the exceptions, and leaves the party to argue his appeal on the judgment and plead- ings alone. (lb.; Robinson v. Hudson 1. R. R. Co., 3 Abb. 115.),If the case on an appeal from the decision of a judge or referee contains no findings of fact, the appeal will be dismissed, unless the parties consent, before the appeal is submitted, to have the case sent back for correction. (Mattthews v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 14 Abb. 209; see Watso v. Barker, 16 Abb. 203.),Under the amendment of 1860 to Â§ 272 of the Code, it is held that an appeal from the judgment entered upon the report of a referee may be entertained on the judg- ment roll, and exceptions taken after judgment. No case need be made, where the findings of fact are admitted, and the conclusions of law only are disputed. (Fergutson v. Hamilton, 35 Barb. 427; see Frost v. Smith, 7 Bosw. 108.) But, in all other cases, the appeal book must con- tain a ease prepared according to the rules.,As to the form of a case, and the mode in which it is prepared, see ante, p. 564.,Printing.]-The cases and points, and all other papers furnished to the general term in calendar causes, must be 970

(Rule 46, Supreme Court; see ante, p. 953.),Service.]-Three printed copies of the case must be served upon the respondent's attorney, at least eight days before the commencement of the term. (Rtle 43, Suplreme Ct.) If this is not done, the opposite party is entitled to move, on affidavit and notice of motion, that the cause be struck from the calendar, and that judgment be rendered in his favor. (Id.),Where no case is made or served, the respondent may, upon the regular call of the cause on the calendar, take a judgment of affirmance for such default. He is not bound to move to dismiss the appeal or to strike it from the calendar. (Oeters v. Groupe, 15 Abb. 263.0),ART. 4.-Bringing on argument. Notice of argumtenet.]-The argument of the appeal is brought on by a notice for the first day of term (Ruk7 42, Suprenme Court); which may be served by either party, at least eight days before the commencement of the term.,This notice must be renewed from term to term, even in the city of New York. It is not a "notice of trial" under Â§ 256 of the Code. (Walsh v. Gregory, N. Y. Trans.; May 7, 1864.),330. Notice of argument. [Iitle of cause.] PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the appeal [describing it] will be brought to a hearing at [&c.] on I[&c.] [If by the respondent, add, and a motion made to dismiss the same.] [Date and address.] [Signature.] * A doubt was expressed on this point in Warren v. Eddy (13 Abb. 28; 32 Barb. 664).,971
Bringing on argument. The argument. Note of issue.]-A note of issue must be filed with the clerk of the court, at least eight days before the term. (Rule 41, Stupreme Ct.),Calendar.]-From the notes of issue, the clerk makes up a calendar, in which the causes are arranged according to the date of service of the notices of appeal. (Rule 41, Supreme Ct.),ART. 5.-The argument. Where to be heard.]-An appeal from a judgment en- tered in the city of New York must be heard at a general term in that city. (Code, Â§ 346, 348.),In other cases, the appeal must be heard in the district including the county in which judgment was entered, or in a county adjoining such county. (Id.),Papers for court.]-At the commencement of the argu- ment, the appellant must furnish a printed copy of the appeal book to each of the judges (Rule 43, tSupreme Ct.), and in practice is required to furnish two or three more, for the reporter and clerk.,Points.]-At the commencement of the argument, each party must serve upon his adversary a printed copy of the points and authorities on which he intends to rely (Rutle 43, Supreme Court), and must furnish a copy to each of the judges. (Id.),Each party must state briefly upon his printed points, the leading facts which he deems established, with a refer- ence to the folios where the evidence of such facts may be found. (Rule 45, Supreme Court.),Counsel.]-Only one counsel will be heard on each side, and for only one hour each, except by special leave of the court. (Rule 54, Supreme Ct.) The appellant opens the ease-the respondent answers-and the appellant may then, if he has not consumed an hour in opening, reply. 972
Principles of determination. Question of fact.,1IAT. 6.-Principlles of determination. Question of fact.]-The general term will not reverse a judgment entered upon the decision of a judge without a jury, on the ground that he erred in lhis fndin g upon a question of fact, if there is any conflicting evidence upon the point, unless perfectly satisfied that such finding was wrong. (Gilinore v. Atlantic & Pacific R. R., 35 Barb. 279; Mawn.v. Witbec7, 17 id. 388; see Gilbert v. Luce, 11 id. 91.) And the rule is the same in regard to a judgment upon the report of a referee. (Morris v. Second Av. R. R., 8 Bosw. 679; Sinclair v. Tallmadge, 35 Barb. 602; loberts v. Carter, 28 Barb. 462; 17 How. 524; Mllu fey v. Brace, 23 Barb. 561; Cady v. Allen, 22 id. 388; Thonmpson v. Wood, 1 Hilt. 93; Pearson v. Fiske, 2 id. 146; 7 Abb. 419; Davis v. M'Cready, 4 E. D. Smith, 565; Fish v. Wood, id. 327; Foster v. Coleman, 1 id. 85; see Brooks v. Christopher, 5 Duer, 216.),The court will not reverse on a finding of fact, not clearly wrong, even though it would have come to a con- trary conclusion upon the evidence as res nova. (N. Y. Car Oil Co. v. Richmond, 6 Bosw. 213; 10 Abb. 185; 19 How. 505.) Especially should the court refuse to interfere, where the only testimony given is that of interested parties, or their assignors, and such testimony is conflicting. (For- ward v. Harris, 30 Barb. 338.),A judgment against clear and undisputed evidence must always be reversed (Smith v. Schanclc, 18 Barb. 344; see Orcutt v. Cahill, 24 N. Y. 578); unless such evidence consists solely of the testimony of an interested party, in which case the probabilities of its truth should be weighed, even if it is uncontradicted. (See Roberts v. Gee, 15 Barb. 449.) And a judgment rendered on a trial without a jury, should be reversed, if clearly against the weight of evi- dence, though not unsupported by evidence. (Thonmpson,973
Principles of determination. Entry of decision. v. Menck, 22 How. 431.) So where a judgment was ren. dered upon the unsupported testimony of a party, con. tradicted by the adverse party, and by some admissions of his own. (lIartmat b v. Proudfit, 6 Bosw. 191; see Boyd v. Colt, 20 How. 384.),Where a referee's report was based upon the suspicious testimony of a single witness, the court reversed the judgment on condition that the appellant paid the costs. (Kennedy v.X. Y. & Harlem R. R., 3 Duer, 69.),ART. 7.-Entry of the decision. There is no provision for a remittitur in any appeal to a general term. The judgment of the appellate tribunal is to be entered in and enforced by it, whether the appeal is from another branch of the saine court, or from another court.,The judgment upon the appeal must be entered and docketed with the clerk in whose office the original judg- ment roll is filed. And for this purpose, when necessary, the judgment on appeal must be certified to such clerk. (Code, Â§ 347.),331. Judgment of affirmance at the general term. [Title of cause.] [ Caption.],The appeal of the [defendant] from the judgment entered in this action on the ........ day of .......... 18.., having been brought to the general term, it is now, on motion of ........... counsel for respondent, after hearing ........, counsel for appel. lant, adjudged that the said judgment be affirmed, and that the respondent ........ recover of the appellant .........., costs of the appeal.,Â§ 332.

What orders are appealable.,CHAPTER CXXVIII. APPEALS FROM ORDERS TO TIIE GENERAL TERM.,ARTICLE 1. What orders are appealable.,2. The argument. 8. The decision. I ART. 1.--What orders are lappealablk. An appeal may be taken from an order made at a special term, by a single judge of the same court, or county or a special county judge, or by a recorder, or recorder's court, iu any stage of the action, including proceedings supplementary to the execution; and may be thereupon reviewed in the following cases: 1. When the order grants or refuses, continues or modifies, a provisional remedy; 2. When it grants or refuses a new trial, or when it sustains or overrules a demurrer; 3. When it involves the merits of the action, or some part thereof, or affects a substantial right; 4. When the order in effect determines the action, and prevents a judgment from which an appeal may be taken; 5. When the order is made upon a summary applica- tion in an action after judgment, and affects a substantial right. (Code, Â§ 349.*) Mere opiiionL.]-A mere opinion of the court, given upon a motion, as for example, for costs upon a verdict, but adjudging nothing, is not an order from which an appeal will lie, although such opinion is in the form of an order, and states that " the plaintiff is entitled to costs," and is entered as an order. (Snyder v. Beyer, 3 E. D. Smith, 235.) *As amended, 1862, by the omission of the word "or," after "special !erm," and the word "a" before "county," and by inserting the words "or by a recorder," &c. The omissions were clearly accidental; and should be disregarded.,975
What are appealable. Orders entered. Orders at circuit. Order to show cause.]-A mere order to show cause is not appealable, even though it directs a certain thing to be done in case cause is not shown. (Watt v. Watt, N. Y. Trans., July 1, 1864.),Order nmuist be entered.]-No order is appealable until it is entered, and the motion papers are filed. Where no papers are used, and the motion is made by consent upon mere verbal statements, no appeal can be taken. (Sinith v. Dodd, 3 E. D. Smith, 215; and see Pierret v. Moller, 3 id. 574.) A direction by the judge, at the foot of the order, to enter it, is not equivalent to an entry of the order, so as to make it appealable. (WFhitak7er v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678.),An order made out of court must be entered before it can be appealed from. (Code, Â§ 350; Plato v. Kelly, 16 Abb. 188; Marshall v. Francisco, 10 How. 147.) The writ- ten direction of the judge at the foot of an order, "enter this," will not suffice for the purpose of appeal, but actual entry must be made. (Whitaker v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678.),Nevertheless, the want of such entry may be waived by going to argument on the merits without objection. (lb.),Orders at circuit.]-Motions at circuit, involving mere questions of circuit practice, are disposed of in an infor- mal way, and the orders made thereon are not strictly reviewable. Of this class are motions to put a cause over the circuit, to put off a cause till a later day in the circuit, motions as to the order of business, to correct the calendar, for attachments against absent witnesses, and various others. The remedy of a party in such cases, if aggrieved, is not by an appeal from the order of the judge, but by a motion at special term, to set aside the proceed- ings for irregularity, or upon terms; and such motions may be made before another judge than the one who held the circuit. (Miller v. Porter, 17 How. 526.) 976
APPEALS FROM ORDERS. What are appealable. Discretionary orders. Orders in, the course of the trial.]-Orders made in the course of the trial of the issues are not, in general, review- able in any way except upon an appeal from the judg- ment. (See Griffin v. Cranston, 5 Bosw. 658.) But if the trial falls through, so as to amount to no trial at all, an order made therein, which would be appealable if made at special term, is, it seems, appealable as an order, before judgment. (Ib.) At any rate, the objection to such an appeal is waived by arguing it on the merits, without moving to dismiss it. (Ib.),Order at chambers.j -An appeal may be taken from an order made at chambers, to the general term (Nicholeon v. Dunhaml, 1 Code Rep. 119), notwithstanding the some- what vague wording of the Code as amended in 1862, as that amendment was really intended to enlarge and not to diminish the number of appealable orders. Ex parte orders.]-It seems that an ex parte order on an original application, by a judge at chamnbers, is not appeal- able (Savage v. Relyea, sp. t., 3 How. 276; Lindsay v. Sher- mlan,, sp. t., 5 id. 308; but see Conklin, v. Dutcher, id. 386) ; though a refusal to vacate such order may be (ib.), and a vacatur of such order, though ex parte, is. (Lancaster v. Boorman, 20 How. 421.) Discretionary orders.]-Under the general principles heretofore stated (ante, p. 886), no order upon a matter resting in the discretion of the court is appealable. No appeal, for this reason, lies from the decision of the court to hear or not to hear a renewal of a motion, or to hear it on precisely the same papers upon which it was once denied (White v. Munroe, 33 Barb. 650; 12 Abb. 357); nor from an order requiring or refusing to require the receiver of an insolvent corporation to give security for costs (Briggs v. Fandenburgh, 22 N. Y. 467), or an order made on the application of bail for leave to surrender,123
What are appealable. Discretionary orders.,-- their principal after the time allowed by law (Bank of Geneva v. Reynolds, 12 Abb. 81; 20 How. 18), or making an allowance to the wife pending an action for divorce (Moncrief v. Moncrief, 10 Abb. 315; Griffin v. Griffin, 23 How. 189, and cases there cited), or staying the proceed. ings of a party in the cause, to enable the adverse party to move in the cause in the Court of Appeals (Hlut v. Bennett, 2 E. D. Smith, 53), or giving leave to file a suffi. cient bond for costs, upon a motion to dismiss the com- plaint for insufficiency of the original bond (Tyrone & Lockhaven B. R. Co. v. Schelc7k, 18 How. 275), or allowing a discontinuance without costs, as against a defendant made a party by mistake. (T17aterbury Manufacturing Co. v. Krause, 1 Hilt. 560; 9 Abb. 175, note.),Conditions of favor .not revielwab7e.]-The conditions on which an order granting a favor (e. g., opening a default) is made, are within the discretion of the judge granting the order, and are not reviewable on appeal, at the in- stance of the party to whom the favor is granted. (PFoshay v. Drost, 4 Bosw. 664; Gale v. Vernon, 4 Sands. 709; Jacobs v. Marshall, 6 Duer, 689; see Burger v. White, 2 Bosw. 92; Lord v. V(andelnbulrg, 15 How. 363.),The general term should not, on appeal from an order directing the payment of money admitted to be due to the plaintiff, review the discretion exercised at special term, in respect to tlie conditions on which the order should be granted. (Merritt v. Thompson, 3 E. D. Smith, 599; 1 Abb. 223.) If they deprive the adverse party of a right which the law gives him, as, for example, if a complaint is amended without allowing the defend- ant to answer, they may be reviewed at his instance. (Union Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267.),Laches.]-Though an order dismissing a motion on the ground of laches is not appealable, yet where the court entertains a motion and receives affidavits on the merits 978
What are appealable. Provisional remedy. New trial. from both sides, an order denying the motion, though upon the ground of laches, is appealable. (JAMES, J., Titus v. Relyea, 8 Abb. 177.) We find no other authority for this distinction, but suppose it may be justified on the theory that a dismissal is no bar to a new motion. Mistakes, &c.r.]-Where an order has been entered, by mistake of the court below, in an erroneous form, the error should be corrected by motion there, and not by appeal. Thus, in Leighton v. Wood (17 Abb. 177), the order having awarded costs to the wrong party, contrary to the inten- tion of the judge, the general term sent it back to him for correction, instead of reversing it. Provisional remeldy.]-An order denying a motion for exoneration of bail is appealable, as in effect continuing a provisional remedy. (Colunbuss Ins. Co. v. Force, 8 How. 353.) The ex parte allowance of an attachment is an order, - and may be reviewed upon appeal. (Conklin v. Dutcher, 5 How. 386; Bank of Lansingburgh v. McKie, sp. t., 7 How. 360.) A contrary decision has, however, been made (Morgan v. Avery, 7 Barb. 656; 2 Code Rep. 91); and it seems to us that the nature of an appeal requires that both sides should be heard below. An exparte order of a judge, vacating an order of arrest granted by him, is appealable. (Lancaster v. Boorman, 20 How. 421.) New trial.]-An appeal will lie from an order granting or refusing a new trial, notwithstanding judgment has meanwhile been entered in the action. (Ptimpelly v. Village of Owego, 13 Abb. 387; 22 How. 385; but see Soverhill v. Post, 22 How. 386.),On a. motion for a new trial, it appearing that the moving party was not entitled to it as a matter of right,,979
What are appealable. New trial. Demurrer, the judge granted it on condition that the inquiry on the new trial should be confined to a single question, on which the party might have been surprised on the former trial, On appeal, it was held that the conditions of the order were not reviewable. (Burger v. White, 2 Bosw. 92.),Demurrer.]-Where a demurrer is sustained or over- ruled, an appeal may be in all cases taken from the order, if judgment has not actually been entered. (Nolton v. Western R. R., 10 How. 97; Reynolds v. Freeman, 4 Sands. 702; Nellis v. De Forest, sp. t., 6 How. 413; Ives v. Miller, 19 Barb. 196; and see Witherhead v. Allen, 28 id. 661.*),This seems to us the plain meaning and'intent of the Code. Nevertheless, it has been held in some cases that a decision upon a demurrer to the whole complaint, sustaining or overruling the demurrer, and directing judg. ment, without leave to answer or amend, is a judgment when entered, and not appealable as an order-that the appeal must be from the judgment. (Banman v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 10 How. 218 ; see. Rarris v. Hammonld, 18 How. 123; Bruce v. Pinck7cey, 8 id. 397; Phipps v. Van Cott, 4 Abb. 90.) This doctrine has been disapproved in cases of at least equal authority with those in which it is maintained (see Nolton v. Western R. R., 10 How. 97; Ives v. Miller, supra), and is plainly inconsistent with the cases which hold that an order for judgment upon a de- murrer as frivolous may be appealed from as an order, which will be cited presently. Moreover, the decision is not a judgment, unless it disposes of the question of costs, and settle their amount. If the successful party chooses to waive costs, he can enter up judgment at once, without entering the decision in the form of an order at all. If,* Wlood v: Lambert (3 Sands. 724); Bentley v. Jones (4 How. 335; 3 Code Rep. 37); and King v. Stafford (6 How. 127), were all decided prior to the amendments of 1851, which for the first time expressly authorized such an appeal. 980
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What are appealable. Orders on demurrers. he does not choose to do this, or if any other question is left undetermined by the decision, e. g., where an assess- ment of damages, a sale of property, or other proceedings are necessary, there is abundant reason for allowing an appeal to be taken from the order, so that the general term may pass upon the main question. at issue, before any such proceedings are had; since, if the judgment should be reversed on the merits, all these intermediate proceedings would be wasted, a result often involving much useless expense and loss of time. (See Ives v. Miller, 19 Barb. 196.) These, however, are but arguments to show that the legislature might very properly have allowed such appeals. The conclusive argument is, that the legis- lature has allowed them, and this in language of the very broadest character. The interpolations attempted to be made by judicial construction are, in our humble opinion, wholly unwarranted, and arise solely from the confusion of ideas upon the question of what is or is not a judgment, of which we have heretofore spoken. (Ante, p. 681.) There is now jno 1loubt that where the demurrer is to a part of the complaint, or where leave to amend or answer is given, an appeal may be taken from the order as such. (Mattoon v. Baker, 24 How. 329; Cook v. Pomeroy, 10 id. 221; Nolton v. Western R. R. Co., id. 97; Phipps v. Van Cott, 4 Abb. 90;# Ford v. Turner & David, 5 Duer, 684; 3 Abb. 385.) An appeal may be taken to the general term from an order of the special term giving judgment on a demurrer as frivolous, as froia an order, and without waiting for judgment to be perfected. (Lee v. Ainslie, 1 Hilt. 277; 4. Abb. 463; Western R. RI. v. .ortriglt, 10 How. 457; see Briggs v. Bergen, 23 N. Y. 162.t) * Overruling Lewis v. Acker (8 How. 414), in the same district. t To the contrary is Bruce v. Pinckney (8 How. 397); approved in Phipps v.. Van Colt (4 Abb. 90); and see Kanouse v. Martin (2 Abb. 390).,981
What are appealable. Orders for judgment. Other orders for judgment.]--An order striking out an answer as sham or irrelevant, and directing judgment for the plaintiff, is appealable, as an order, to the general term. (See Briggs v. Bergen, 23 N. Y. 162; but see Bar. ris v. Hammond, 18 How. 123.) So an appeal will lie from an order for judgment upon an answer as frivolous. (Western I. B. v. Kortright, 10 How. 457.),But the decision of a cause on its trial, is not an order from which an appeal will lie. Thus, if on the trial, the court or referee decides in favor of either party, and an account is ordered to ascertain the amount for which judgment is to be rendered, no appeal can be taken until after the accounting has been had, and a final judgment thereon entered. (Mc3lfa7on v. Allen, 7 Abb. 1.),In an action brought to declare a deed to be a mort- gage, and to establish the right of the plaintiff to redeem, the cause having been tried before a justice of the court, a final decision was made, disposing of the whole case, except that a reference was ordered to take an account- ing. The defendants appealed from this order to the general term. It was held that the appeal was irregular, and must be dismissed. The order from which an appeal is allowed by section 349 must, it 'vas held, be something different from a decision made during the progress of the trial, and something other than a conclusion of law includ- ed in the decision on which the judgment, in whole or in part, is to be entered. (Lawrence v. Farmers' Loan & TnIst Co., 15 How. 57; see D'Ivernois v. Leavitt, 8 Abb. 59.),Such an appeal, however, though irregular, is not void, and the objection to it may be, and is waived, by submit- ting to a decision upon the merits on such appeal. (D'Ivtr- nois v. Leavitt, 8 Abb. 59.),Orders involving merits.]-As all orders in the progress of a cause necessarily affect the merits in some degree, so all may be the subject of an appeal, unless they relate merely to matters of practice and procedure, or rest in that discretion which is not and cannot be governed by 982
What are appealable. Merits. Irregularity. any fixed principle or rules. (Cruger. v. Douglass, 8 Barb. 81; 2 Code Rep. 123.) By the "merits" are to be under- stood the strict legal rights of the parties, as distinguished from mere questions of practice, and matters depending on the discretion of the court. (St. Joh7 v. West, 4 How. 329; approved in Tallmnan v. Hinlman, 10 id. 89; Tracy v. N. Y. Steam Faucet Co., 1 E. D. Smith, 357; see Salters v. Gelnin, 10 Abb. 478; 19 How. 233.) By a "substantial right," is to be understood a question of right involved in the.issues. (Salters v. Genin, supra.),An order denying the exclusive right of a party to a sum of money, is appealable as affecting a substantial right. (Artisans' Bank v. Treadwzell, 34 Barb. 553.),An order which affects a substantial right of a party, and which, if permitted to stand, may entirely deprive him of a complete defense to the action, is appealable. (Fassett v. Tallmadge, 15 Abb. 205.) Irregularity.]-An order refusing to set aside a pro- ceeding on a mere question of regularity, the appellant not having been actually prejudiced by the irregularity complained of, is not appealable (7'allman v. Hinman, 10 How. 89; Hammond v. Tillotson, 18 Barb. 332; see Cru- ger v. Douglass, 8 Barb. 81), even though, relying upon such irregularity to obtain relief, the appellant has allowed his default to be taken. (See Tallman v. Himlan, supra.) But if the irregularity is one which has deprived the appellant of an important right in the conduct of the suit, as, for example, of due notice of a proceeding in the cause an order refusing to correct it is appealable. (Tracy v. N. Y. Steam Paucet Co., 1 E. D. Smith, 349; see Morris v. Crawford, 16 Abb. 124; Johnson v. Farrell, 10 Abb. 384.; Marqilat v. Mulvy, 9 How. 460.),Orders hlanging parties.]-An order on an application to allow a new party to be substituted is usually in the discretion of the court, and not appealable. (McGown v.,983
What are appealable. Changing parties. Pleadings. Leavenworth, 2 E. D. Smith, 24.) But where a party having a cause of action is substituted for one who has none, an appeal will lie. (See Davis v.' Mayor &c. of N. Y., 14 N. Y. 506.),An order allowing an action to be continued in the names of surviving plaintiffs and the heir of the deceased plaintiff, and allowing the complaint to be amended by the addition of new claims, and a supplemental complaint to be filed, is appealable. (St. Joln v. Croel, 10 How. 253.) An order reviving an action against executors, &c., on the motion of the adverse party, is appealable. (Rogers v. Paterson, 4 Paige, 450.),Where it is a matter of doubt who are the successors of a deceased plaintiff, and different parties, who certainly are not all entitled to recover, are proposed to be substi- tuted to save the rights, it has been held a matter of dis- cretion with the court, to allow or not to allow the sub- stitution, and its order was held not appealable as involv- ing the merits. (St. Jol7 v. WIest, 4 How. 329.*),An interpleader order under Â§ 122 of the Code, substi- tuting an adverse claimant as a defendant, is appealable. It affects a substantial right. (Wilson v. Duncan, 11 Abb.3.),An order denying a motion of the defendant to substi- tute the assignee of the plaintiff pending suit, as plaintiff, against his will, is not appealable. (Packard1v. Wood, 17 Abb. 318.),Orders concerning pleadinigs.]-An order striking out from an answer one of several defenses as irrelevant, is appealable (Trustees of Penn Yan v. Sorbes, 8 How. 285); but an order refusing to strike out matter in a pleading as irrelevant and redundant, is not. (Bedell v. Stickles, 4 How. 432; 3 Code R. 105; Whitney v. Waterman, 4 How. 313.),* It seems to us that it would be a violation of right to grant such an order, and that, if granted, it would be appealable. 984
What are appealable. Pleadinga. Reference. An order allowing a supplemental answer setting up a new defense, is appealable. It clearly involves the merits, or at least affects a substantial right, the right of the plaintiff to recover upon the previous answer of the de- fendant. (Harrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 161; and see St. Jo1hn v. Croel, 10 How. 253.) And an order refusing leave to file a supplemental answer, setting up facts arising since the former answer was served, is appealable. (Bowen v. Irish Presbyterian Congregation, 6 Bosw. 245.) An order granting leave to amend a pleading (N. Y. Ice Co. v. Northwestern Ins. Co., 23 N. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296), or refusing such leave (Salters v. Genin, 10 Abb. 478; 19 How. 233; see Macqueen v. Bab- cooki, 13 Abb. 268; 22 How. 229), is not appealable.,An order refusing leave to reply, after the time to reply is past, does not involve the merits, and has been held not appealable. (Thompson v. Starkwveather, 2 Code Rep. 41.) The Code at that time authorized an appeal only when an order involved the merits. But, in a later case, an order made on a motion for further time to answer after the time has expired, but before judgment entered, where the defendant had been simply irregular in his practice, was held appealable. (MeGuin v. Case, 9 Abb. 160; S. 0., Quin v. Case, 2 Hilt. 467.),Order of reference, &ec.J-An order directing a reference of an action which the court has power to refer is not appealable. (Kennedy v. Shilton, 1 Hilt. 546; 9 Abb. 157 n.; Gray v. Fox, Code Rep. N. S. 334; Bryan v. Brennon, 7 How. 359; Dean v. Empire State Ins. Co., 9 id. 69; Ubsdell v. Root, 3 Abb. 142; 1 Hilt. 173.) But an order which directs a reference in a case in which a refer- ence is not authorized by law, is appealable. (Whitaker v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678; Cram v. Bradjbrd, 14 Abb. 193.),An order denying a motion to remove a referee, appoint- ed by consent, no objections being made to him which were not known to the appellant when he consented to,124,985

Smith, 32.),An order made on a motion to set aside a report of a referee for irregularity, is appealable. (Mathews v. Jones, 1 E. D. Smith, 429.),Costs.]-Where costs are a matter of strict legal right, and not of discretion, an order granting them (Burluu v. Tibbits, 7 How. 74; Megrath v. Van Wyck, 3 Sands. 750), or denying a motion to correct their adjustment (Sluyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673), is appealable.,An order granting an allowance, within the limit allowed by law (Union Bank v. Mott, 13 Abb. 247; Dickson v. Mo- Elivain, 7 How. 138), or denying such an application, is not appealable. (Cook v. Dickcenson, 5 Sands. 663.) But an order awarding an allowance exceeding the highest rate allowed by law, affects a substantial right, and is there- fore appealable. (Wilkinson v. Tiffany, 4 Abb. 98.),An order granting an extra allowance cannot be re- viewed merely upon submission of the order and bill of costs. It must appear by affidavits that the case was one in which the prevailing party had no claim to extra com- pensation, or in which the allowance was made too great. (Dana v. Fiedler, Code Rep. N. S. 224.),The costs of motions (Dickson v. MlcE lwuain, 7 How. 138; .lammiond v. Tillotson, 18 Barb. 332; Niles v. Gr.iswold, 3 Code Rep. 164), or costs imposed as a condition upon grant- ing relief upon defaults (Fos1iay v. Drost, 4 Bosw. 664; Joyce v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 12 Abb. 309; 20 How. 439; Niles v. Griswold, supra), are not the subject of appeal.,A motion in the nature of an appeal from the decision of a clerk in the adjustment of costs, can only be enter- tained at a special term.

Bartlett, 28 Barb. 480; 8 Abb. 42; Young v. Bloomer, 22 How. 383.),Conltempts.]-An order dismissing proceedings to enforce a civil remedy by attachment for contempt, such as to compel the appearance of the defendant for examination under Â§ 292 of the Code (Holstein v. Rice, 15 Abb. 307; Livingstolo v. Swift, 23 How. 1), or refusing an attach- ment against a witness disobeying a subpoena (Lafarge v. Lafarge Fire Ins. Co. 14 How. 26), is appealable.,An order discharging a party from imprisonment for a contempt, on account of his inability to pay the fine, or bear the confinement, seems not to be appealable. (See People v. Delvecchio, 18 N. Y. 352.),Whether an order discharging a party from a charge of contempt of the class known as "extraordinary con- tempts," in which the dignity of the court is principally concerned, and the party has only an indirect interest, is an appealable order seems doubtful. (See People v. King, 9 How. 97.),Other orders.]-An order changing the place of trial as a matter of right (Houtck v. Lasher, 17 How. 520), or re- fusing an application for the examination of an adverse party before trial (Green v. Wood, 6 Abb. 277; see Cook v. Bidweell, 17 Abb. 300), is appealable. An )rder granting or refusing a discovery or inspection of documents is, by constant practice, treated as appeal- able, and rightly so, notwithstanding a contrary intimation in White v. Munroe (33 Barb. 650; 12 Abb. 357). It has been lately decided to be appealable. (Woods v. De Figa- niere, 25 How. 522.),An order refusing a commission seems to be appealable to the general term (see Ring v. Mott, 2 Sands. 683; Forrest v. Forrest, 9 Abb. 307; 3 Bosw. 661); but whether,987
What are appealable. Orders after judgment. an order granting a commission is appealable, does not seem clear. An unreported case (Thatcher v. Bennett, Voorh. Code [6th ed.], 485), appears to hold that it is not. And the general term will be reluctant to interfere with the decision' of the judge. (Adams v. Co~rield, 28 L. J. [Ex.] 31.),An order directing the sale of the property which is the subject of the suit, and ordering the money to be brought into court, to abide the final order to he made upon the rights of the parties, relates only to the preser- vation of the property; it does not affect the merits of the cause, and therefore is not a subject of appeal. (Chapman v. Hammersley, 4 Wend. 172.),Orders after judgment.]-An order refusing to set aside a judgment for irregularity in a mere matter of form, e. g., because the summons does not name any court, is not appealable. (Tallman v. Hilnman, 10 How. 89.),But an order denying a motion "to set aside the judg- ment for irregularity, in this, to wit, in entering up judgment and filing a record thereof subsequently to a full and complete settlement," was held'appealable, as not founded on mere irregularity (Marquat v. MIuly, 9 How. 460); and an appeal will lie from an' order denying a motion to set aside a default as irregularly taken. (Fassett v. Tallm7adge, 15 Abb. 205; Tracy v. N. Y. Steam Faucet Co., 1 E. D. Smith, 349.),An order made on application of the comptroller of the city of New York, under the act of 1859, to open a judg- ment against the corporation, not taken by default, is appealable. (Joyce v. Mayor &c. of New York, 12 Abb. 309; 20 How. 439.),An application for the necessary process to enforce the judgment of the court involves the merits, and an order granting or refusing it is appealable. (Cruger v. Douglass, 8 Barb. 81; 2 Code Rep. 123.) 988
What are appealablo. Orders after judgment. An order denying the application of the successful party to have the amount 6f the judgment paid by a receiver in the action out of partnership funds in his hands (Arti- sans' Bank v. Treadwcll, 34 Barb. 553), an order of super- sedeas (Wtells v. JolCes, 2 Abb. 20), and an order compelling the successful party to file a judgment roll (IIeinemannl v. Waterbitry, 5 Bosw. 686), are all appealable. An order denying a motion to vacate the satisfaction of a judgment, for the purpose of enforcing the lien of the attorney, is appealable. (Ward v. Wordsworth & Symne, 1 E. D. Smith, 598; 9 How. 16.) An order denying a motion to have the clerk enter on the docket of a judgment appealed from, that it is " secured on appeal," is not appealable. (Fitch v. Licingston, 4 Sands. 712.) An order dismissing proceedings supplementary to exe- cution is appealable. (O'lNeil v. Martin, 1 E. D. Smith, 404.) Order olpening defatlt.]-An order of the special term opening a default (Whitaker v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678), or letting in a party to defend after judgment (Leighlton v. Wood, 17 Abb. 177; Mulddenor v. M'Dolnorgh, 2 Hilt. 46; Churchill v. IMaitllison,' id. 70; lMead v. Mlfead, 2 E. D. Smith, 223; Bolton v. Depeyster, 3 Code R. 141), or refus- ing to do so (Millard v. Van Ralst, 17 Abb. 310 n.; Lewlis v. Graham, 16 Abb. 126), is not appealable. The fact that the excuse upon whicll a default was opened was insufficient (Leighton v. Wood, 17 Abb. 177; Whitaler v. Desfosse, 7 Bosw. 678), or that there was no excuse (see Leighton v. Wood, supra), is, in the absence of a positive abuse of discretion, no ground for appeal.,ART. 2.-The argumentt.

(Rule 7, Superior Ct.),Papers.]-The papers upon which the appeal is heard consist of the notice of appeal, the order appealed from, and the papers upon which the court or judge below made the order.,Copies of all these papers must be submitted to the court by the appellant, at the opening of the argument. Such copies may be either written or printed. The Newl York Common Pleas require such copies to be certified by the clerk of the court. (Rtle, May 2, 1857.) The other courts do not.,Four copies must be furnished in the Supreme Court and New York Common Pleas, and nine copies in the New York Superior Court.,The appellant is not bound .to furnish the respondent with any copy of the papers, on an appeal of this nature. (People v. Board of Education, N. Y. Trans., May 13, 1864.),Where heard.]-The rules as to the place at which the appeal is to be heard are the same as on an appeal from a judgment.

If no opposing affidavits were read below, every reason- able presumption must be made, on appeal, in favor of the respondent. (Jackson v. Smith, 16 Abb. 201; see Union Bank v. Mlott, 9 id. 106.) An order of reference to determine the amount of liability of the obligors in an undertaking given on obtaining an injunction, will not be reversed on appeal as premature, unless it is perfectly clear that no action will lie on the undertaking. (Carpelnter v. Wright, 4 Bosw. 655.),Conflict of evidence.]-It has been a common practice, among judges sitting at general tern, to apply to appeals from orders the rule which is established in regard to the review of trials by juries, that a verdict cannot be dis- turbed, if not palpably against the clear weight of evidence, even though the appellate court is of opinion that it is erroneous. (See Courter v. McNamarat, 9 How. 258; Skinner v. Oettinger, 14 Abb. 109.) In the case of Brodskcy v. Ihms (16 Abb. 251), the dissenting opinion of DALY, J., contain4 some very judicious remarks upon this subject, which we adopt as our own, and which were not disapproved of by his colleagues. He says: "I doubt if the rule as to the conclusiveness of the finding of a jury upon conflicting evidence has any application to a motion, where the evidence is not, as in the case of a jury, given orally, but is presented in the form of an affidavit. An appellate tribunal, in my judgment, is just as competent to pass upon a question presented upon affi- davits as the judge who first heard the motion. All that he had before him they have before them, and are, there-,991

The witnesses are examined and cross-examined in the view and hearing of the jury, who are, consequently, better able to pass upon the question of their credibility, where the evidence is conflicting, than an appellate tribunal could possibly be. This reason, however, does not apply where the question arises upon affidavits, which one judge may pass upon as intelligently as another.",Order on alppeal.]-In general, on reversing an order, the appellate court makes such an order in the case as should have been made by the court below, and does not remand it for a rehearing. But, on reversing an order upon a matter resting in discretion, on the ground that the court below did not exercise its discretion, the appel- late court will not determine the application itself, but will leave the appellant to renew it in the court below.

Judgments rendered in civil cases (Code, Â§ 351), by which is meant civil actions, and not special proceed- ings (People v. Bigelow, 11 How. 83; see People v. Iillis, 5 Abb. 210), by courts of justices of the peace, by jus- tices' courts in cities, by the district courts of the city of New York, or by the general term of the marine court of that city, are reviewable only in the mode prescribed by this chapter. (Code, Â§ 351.*),A judgment in a justice's court, upon a mechanic's claim under the lien law, is a judgment in a civil action, and must be reviewed by appeal. (People v. Co.

Weller, 2 Johns. 8.),Only an actual deternmination of the marine court, at a general term, is appealable. (Code, Â§ 352.) As to what is such a determination, see ante, p. 947. But a judgment rendered by default in a justice's or district court is appealable. (See Code, Â§ 366; Willins v. Wheeler, 28 Barb. 668; 8 Abb. 116; Fitch v. Devrin, 15 Barb. 47; Beach v. McCann, 1 Hilt. 256; 4 Abb. 18; Howard v. Brown, 2 B. D. Smith, 247.),ART. 2.-To what court the appeal lies. In the city of New York, appeals of this description must be taken to the Court of Common Pleas. (Code, Â§ 352; see Day v. Swackhamer, 5 Abb. 345 n.) Appeals from the justices' courts of Buffalo must be taken to the Supe- rior Court of that city. (Code, Â§ 352.) Appeals from all other justices' courts must be taken to the county court of the county in vwhich they are held. (Id.),The determination of a county court on such appeal is reviewable, on a further appeal, by the Supreme Court. (Code, Â§ 344.) But the determination of the New York Common Pleas, or Buffalo Superior Court, is reviewable only by special leave, in the mode prescribed, ante, p. 944.,ART. 3.-Notice of appeal. The appeal is made by serving a notice of appeal, of the form and in the manner here prescribed. (Code, 353.),lFormn.]-The notice must be in writing. An oral notice is of no effedt. (People v. Eldridge, sp. t., 7 How. 108.),Specification of :rounds.]-The grounds upon which the appeal is founded must be stated in the notice. (Code, Â§ 353.) This must be done with clearness and precision. A general allegation that the judgment is contrary to law and evidence (Kelty v. Jenkins, 1 Hilt. 73; Lee v. 994
Notice of appeal. Form of notice. Scklhidt, id. 537; 6 Abb. 183; Derby v. Hanni., 5 Abb. 150; 15 How. 32), or that material evidence was errone- ously excluded or admitted (Delc7hars v. WhCeaton, 16 How. 471), or that the evidence was insufficient (ib.), or a mere reference to the proceedings on the trial (Mayor &c. of N. Y. v. GrCeen, 1 Hilt. 393), or to affidavits on which the appeal is founded (ib.), will not suffice for this purpose; except in those cases in which a new trial is to be had as a matter of right (see post, p. 1023), in which, the grounds of appeal being of no possible importance, any statement of objection will suffice, however vague or frivolous. (i'owler v. Westervelt, 40 Barb. 374; 17 Abb. 59.),In cases in which a new trial might be had as of right, the appellant should, if he desires not to have such new trial, state in his notice that the appeal is taken upon questions of law only. This will send the case to the general term for decision upon the facts as proved already. (Code, Â§ 352.#) Remedy against defective notice.]-It is well settled that an appeal should be dismissed on motion, " the notice states no ground of appeal (Grisivold v. anL Deusen, 2 E. D. Smith, 178; Irwit v. _Muir, sp. t., 4 Abb. 133; 13 How. 409; Willians v. Ciunminyham, 2 Sands. 632; see Webster v. Hopkiis, 11 How. 140), or if the statement is too vague to point out any specific error (WIilliams v. Cun- nintlwlhLm, supra; see Deuchars v. Wheaton, 16 How. 471), unless the case is one in which a new trial is to be had as of course. (See supra.),But there is some conflict of opinion as to whether the judgment should be affirmed for this cause alone, where no motion has been made to dismiss the appeal. It is the settled practice inw the city of New York (Lee v. Sc.imidt, 1 Hilt. 537; 6 Abb. 183; Moore v. Sonmerindyke, 1 Hilt. 599), and in the seventh judicial district (Derby v.,* As amended, 1864.,995
Notice of appeal. Remedy against defective notice. Hannin, 5 Abb. 150; 15 How. 32; Detuchars v. Ilhteato%, 16 How. 471; Bus]h v. Dennison, 14 How. 307), to affirm the judgment, if no ground of appeal is distinctly set up by the notice, and to disregard all objections not raised by the notice. (See also Crisntan. v. Paul, sp. t., 16 How. 17.) The same rule appears to be followed in the fourth judicial district. (See IMleEachron v. Randies, 34 Barb. 301.) On the other hand, it is the practice in the sixth (IForman v. Forman, 17 How. 255), and eighth judi- cial districts (Webster v. 1opl7ins, 11 How. 140), to reverse for any errors, whether specified by the notice or not; on the ground that the motion to dismiss is the only remedy.,Our own judgment inclines us to a middle path. If the notice contains absolutely no statement of the grounds of appeal, or none sufficiently definite, a motion to dismiss would clearly be proper; and we think that the respondent, by failing so to move, waives the objection. But if any one ground of objection is specifically stated, it is clear that the appeal could not be dismissed, no matter how unfounded it might be:. and therefore, if the court will review all objections that can be discovered, whether stated in the notice or not, it will be quite practicable to adopt a stereotyped form of notice, specifying an objec- tion which in nine cases out of ten would have no founda- tion in fact (as for example, that " the court improperly refused to nonsuit"); thus completely nullifying the intention of the Code. The view, therefore, which we take, is that where the appeal is allowed to go to argument upon the merits, the appellant should be permitted to rely upon any objection, if the notice specified none in particular; but that if it specified any objections in such manner as to prevent the appeal from being dismissed, he should be confined to thenm.,Statemeit of relief as7;eJ.]-The notice should also state in what particulars the appellant desires that the judgment should be made more favorable to him. (Code, Â§ 371.) 996
Notice of appeal. Form and contents. This is, however, merely for the purpose of affecting the costs, which will be recovered by the respondent in case such a statement is omitted, even though the judgment should be reversed. The omission would not otherwise prejudice the appeal.,If the appellant claims that the judgment should he wholly reversed, lie need not specify any particulars in his notice of appeal, as this provision is intended only for cases in which a partial reversal or modification is all that is sought. (WyTnkJool) v. Halbert, sp. t., 25 How. 158; see Forsyth v. Ferguson, 27 id. 67.) It has been held that, under this provision, the appellant was not bound to specify the amount to which the judg- ment should be reduced, and that if he did, it was mere surplusage. (Fox v. NVellis, 25 How. 144.) And therefore, where the notice claimed that a judgment for $160 should be reduced to $5, it was held that the respondent could not recover costs, the judgment being reduced to $130 on appeal. (Ib.) But a later case (Forsyth v. Ferguson, 27 How. 67) seems to be to the contrary, and to hold that the respondent ought to recover costs, unless the notice of appeal specifies the amount to which the judgment should be reduced, and that correctly. And to this view we incline.,Â§ 334. Notice of alpe(l from a justice's court.

(Code, Â§ 354.),Where the justice has a clerk, the appellant may serve the notice upon either, at his option. (Irwin v. Muir, sp. t., 4 Abb. 133; 13 How. 409.) If for any reason the notice cannot be thus served upon the justice or his clerk, it may and must be served upon the clerk of the county. (Code, Â§ 359.),ART. 4.-Deposit and security on appeal. In, New York city.]-On appeals taken from the marine court or any district court in the city of New York, by any party other than the ccity corporation (Lawus 1858, Ch. 334), the appellant must, at the time of service of the *notice of appeal, pay to the clerk of the court below, or, in a district court, to the justice or clerk, at his optionD 998
Deposit and security. In New York city. two dollars, as the fee for the return. (Code, Â§ 354.) And if this fee is not paid at that time, the justice or clerk cannot be compelled to accept it afterwards, or to make the return. (Code, Â§ 360; see Van Heusen v. Eirkpatrick, sp. t., 5 How. 422.),The appellant must also, within twenty days after judg- ment, execute awritten undertaking, with one or more suffi- cient sureties, to the effect that he will pay all costs, dis- bursements, and extra costs, awarded against him in the court below, in case of affirmance, together with all costs and damages which may be awarded against him on the appeal. The sureties must justify in double the amount specified in the undertaking; and both it and the sureties must be approved by the justice (meaning, we suppose, any justice) of the court below, or by a judge of the Common Pleas. This undertaking must be filed with the clerk of the Common Pleas. (Code, Â§ 354.),It is not indispensable that the approval of the justice should be indorsed within the twenty days. Where he orally approved of the sureties, and, being about to leave the county, promised to and did indorse his approval on his return, this was held sufficient. (People v. Dutchess C. P. 7 Cow. 487.),The sureties in this undertaking are not bound to pay the damages recovered in the court below, in case of affirm- ance. (Oindrdoni v. Emrmons, 2 Hilt. 504; 9 Abb. 187.),Instead of this undertaking, the appellant may deposit with the clerk of the Common Pleas the costs, disburse- ments, and extra costs, included in the judgment below, with fifteen dollars in addition, to abide the event of the appeal. (Code, Â§ 354.) Under a similar provision in the old statute concerning proceedings for the review of jus- tices' judgments (Laws 1824, ch. 238), it was held that these costs must be paid to the officer named therein, and that it would be unavailing to pay them to the re- spondent (ex parte Stephens, 6 Cow. 69), though they might be paid to any person authorized by the officer to,999

Dultcless C.-P., 7 Cow. 487); that they must be paid to the officer even Where the appellant:was himself entitled to receive the costs under the judgment People v. Saratoga C. P., 1 Wend. 282); and that they must be actually paid in cash, and not merely credited by the officer as paid. (Ex prte Lafarge, 6 Cow. 61.),If the judgment is affirmed, this amount is to be paid over to the respondent, to be applied first in satisfaction 'of the execution issued on the judgment of affirmance, and the balance, if any, tothe original judgment. (Code, Â§ 354.) If the appellant is successful, the deposit must be repaid to him. (Id.) But it has been doubted whether, upon obtaining relief from a default below, the appellant is entitled to such repayment. (Seymour v. Elmer, 4 E. D. Smith, 201.),Unless the undertaking is executed, or the deposit made, within the time above mentioned, the appeal is ineffectual. (Code, Â§ 354.),Out of New York city.J-On an appeal from a justice's court, in any other part of the state, the appellant must, at the time of serving the notice of appeal on the justice or clerk, pay to him the costs awarded by the judgment appealed from, and two dollars for the return. (Code, Â§ 354.) It may not suffice to pay these costs to the re- spondent, nor to take a receipt without actual payment. (See ante, p. 999.),And if the action is one in which the appellant is enti- tled to a new trial as a matter of right, he must, at the same time, give security to stay the execution (Code, Â§ 335),* in the manner prescribed by the next article. As to when a new trial is a matter of right, see post, p. 1023.,ART. 5.-Stay of execution. If the appellant desires a stay of execution of the judg- ment, he must give a written undertaking, executed by,* As amendedr 1863..
.Stay of execution. The undertaking. one or more. sufficient sureties, approved by the county judge or by the court below, to the effect that if judgment be rendered against the appellant, and execution thereon be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the sureties will pay the amount unsatisfied. (Code, t 355, 356.),The undertaking ought to state the amount of the judg- ment appealed from. (Ex parte Alvord, 6 Cow. 585.),The delivery of this undertaking to the court below stays the issuing of execution (Code, Â§ 357); or, if execu- tion has been issued, the service of a copy of the under- taking, certified by the court below, upon the officer holding the execution, stays further proceedings thereon. (Id.) And where, by reason of his death, removal from the county, or for any other cause, the undertaking can- not be delivered to the justice, it must be filed with the 'clerk of the appellate court, and notice thereof given to the respondent, or his attorney or agent, in the manner prescribed in Â§ 354 (see ante, p. 998); and has thereupon the same effect as if delivered to the justice. (Code, Â§ 358.),The appellant is not required to serve any copy of this undertaking, or notice of its existence, upon the respond- ent, in any case except where he has been unable to serve it upon the justice. (Jackson v. Smith, 16 Abb. 201.) : If, before the undertaking is served, the constable has levied upon any property, the service of the undertaking does not entitle the appellant to a return of the goods. The proceedings will be stopped in the precise stage in which they actually exist at the time of service. (Smith v. Allen, 2 E. D. Smith, 259; see ante, p. 905.) But where the plaintif, after he was served with the undertaking, on the same day ordered the constable to levy on property, and the latter did so before he was served, the court set aside the levy. (Jones v.; SCarl, 7 Abb. 418.),The appellate court has not power to stay proceedings on the judgment on any other conditions than those pre- -scribed by the.Code. (Hawkins v..Mayor &c. of N. Y. sp. t., 5 Abb. 344.),126,1001
Offer to correct judgment. The return.,AST. 5.-Offer to correct judgment. Within fifteen days after service of the notice of appeal, the respondent may serve upon the appellant and justice an offer, in writing, to allow the judgment to be corrected in any of the particulars mentioned in the notice of appeal, (Code, Â§ 371.*),The appellant may, within five days thereafter, file with the justice a written acceptance of such offer, who must thereupon make a minute thereof in his docket, and cor- rect the judgment, and any execution that may have been issued thereon, accordingly. (Id.) And any undertaking given to stay execution can be enforced only for the amount of the judgment as corrected. (Id.),If the appellant claims in his notice that the judgment should be wholly reversed, this offer need not be made. (Wyn7loop v. Halbert, sp. t., 25 How. 158.),Effect of offer.--Of course the acceptance of such an offer puts an end to the appeal. As to the effect of this offer, and its acceptance or refusal upon the costs of the appeal, see ante, p. 653.,AnT. 7.-Return by the court below. The court below must make a return to the appellate court of the testimony, proceedings and judgment, and file the same in the appellate court. (Code, Â§ 360.),A justice, who has gone out of office since rendering Â· judgment, may and must nevertheless make a return the same as if he was still in office. (Code, Â§ 361.),Wrhen to be made.]-The return must be made after ten days, and within thirty days from service of the notice of appeal. (Code, Â§ 360.) But this provision is merely di- rectory, and the return is perfectly valid whenever served (Ex parte Kellogg, 3 Cow. 372.),* As amended, 1862. 1002
Return. How compelled. Form. Return, how compelled.]-This return may be compelled by attachment (Code, Â§ 360), provided the fee therefor was paid at the time of serving the notice of appeal (id.); but not otherwise. (See Van Heusen v. Kirkcpatrick, sp. t., 5 How. 422.),In the New York Common Pleas, this attachment will be granted by any judge of the court at chambers. (Ante, i. 233.),Course of respondent when no rettur is filed.]-In the New York Common Pleas, if the return is not made in time, the respondent may serve a written notice, requiring it to be done within ten days thereafter, and that in default thereof, he will apply to the general term, on the first day thereof, for an order dismissing the appeal. (Ante, i. 233.) .Upon proof of service of such notice, and non-compliance Â·therewith, such order will be granted, unless further time is allowed by the court for cause shown. (lb.),In other parts of the state, the respondent may move to dismiss the appeal, without such preliminary notice, upon this ground. (Van Hecusen v. Kir7lpairick, sp. t., 5 How. 422.) Form and contents of return.]-The return must con- tain all the evidence and proceedings upon the trial (Orcutt v. Cahill, 24 N. Y. 578; Calligan v. Mix, 12 How. 495; see Ogden v. Sanderson, 3 E. D. Smith, 166; McCafferty v. Kelly, 2 Sands. 637; Bels7haw v. Colic, 3 Code Rep. 184), and the notice of appeal (Cabre v. Sturges, 1 Hilt. 160); and should state the substance of the pleadings (Roulston v. McClelland, 2 E. D. Smith, 60; see Spring v. Baker, 1 Hilt. 526), the nature of the issue (Smith v. Van Brunt, 2 E. D. Smith, 534), the judgment (Woodside v. Pender, 2 E. D. Smith, 390), the disposition made of all questions arising at the trial (Matthews v. 'iestel, 2 E. D. Smith, 90), and the dates of the various proceedings, such as the return of the summons, the joinder of issue, the,1003
Return. Form. Further return. *adjournment;, if any, and the judgment. (Peters v. Diossy, 3 E. D. Smith, 115.),The rettrn ought to contain all the facts in itself, and should not be eked out by postscripts or memoranda annexed thereto. (Logue v. Gillick, 1 E. D. Smith, 398) And papers annexed to the return, but not referred to in it in any way, cannot be regarded as a part of it. (Spring v. Baker, 1 Hilt. 526.) But papers referred to in the re- turn as a part thereof, and transmitted therewith, are to be treated as if embodied in it, although not even an- nexed thereto. (Stolp v. Van Cortland, 3 Wend. 492.),Who may prepare return.]-The justice may employ the attorney for the respondent to prepare his return (Hun. ter v. Graves, 4 Cow. 537); but may not allow the attor- ney for the appellant to do so (Fox v. Johnson, 3 Cow, 20; SRudd v. Baker, 7 Johns. 548); though he may em- ploy him as a mere amanuensis, dictating the whole to him. (Phillips v. Caswiell, 4 Cow. 505; see Fox v. J'oh7son,. supra.),We venture to express our conviction that all these distinctions are untenable, and that no party, or attorney for a party, ought to be allowed to have anything to do with the preparation of the return.,Further rettrn.]-If the return is defective, the appel- late court may direct a further or amended return as often as may be necessary, and may compel a compliance with its order, by attachment. And the court is always deemed open for these purposes. (Code, Â§ 362.),The court will not require a return to be amended by inserting matter which cannot possibly affect the decision. (Keeler v. Adams, 3 Cai. 84.),A motion for a further return should usually be made before bringing on the appeal for argument, and at an early day. But where the defect is obvious, the case may be laid over at, the hearing for an amendment to the ;1004
Beturn. Evidence in place of. return (Matthewss v. Fiestel, 2 E. D. Smith, 90; Taylor v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 4 id. 559); though this is seldom done. . The cause cannot be put on the calendar until the amended return, if any, is filed (People v. Clinton Co. Judge, sp. t., 13 How. 277), nor can the appeal be dis- missed while awaiting such return. And where a county court, so dismissed an appeal, the Supreme Court held the dismissal to be a nullity, and granted a mandamus to compel judgment. (Ib.) ART. 8.--Evidenc i i place of or suppllementary to return.,Wlrere no return canl be htad.]-If the justice whose judg- ment is appealed from has died, become insane, or removed from the state, the appellate court may examine witnes- ses, on oath, to the facts and circumstances of the trial or judgment, and determine the appeal thereon. (Code, Â§ 363.) But a justice who has removed to another county in this state may be compelled by the appellate court to make the return, a ;u other cases. (Id.) Affidavits of errors in fact.]-WhTere an appeal is founded on an error in fact in the proceedings, not affecting the merits of the action, and not within the knowledge of the justice, the court may determine the alleged error in fact on affidavits; and may, in its discretion, inquire into and determine the same upon examination of the witnes- ses. (Code, Â§ 366.) As to what facts may be thus shown, see post, p. 1009.,Copies of such affidavits must be served upon the res- pondent eight days before the opening of the court for which the argument is noticed. (Hurd v. Beeann, sp. t., 8 How. 254; approved, Cool7 v. Swift, 10 Abb. 212; 18 How. 454.) The respondent may oppose upon counter affidavits. (Ib.),1005 ,
Evidence in place of return. Dismissal.,_ . Affulavits on application for relief from default.]--On this application affidavits may be used by the appellant, in addition to the return. (Code, Â§ 366.) These ought, doubtless, to be served upon the respondent eight days before the court opens.,Whether the plaintiff can use counter-affidavits on the appeal, to show that no injustice has been done, has been doubted. (See Lent v. Jones, 4 E. D. Smith, 52; Camnp v. Steiwart, 2 id. 88.) It certainly seems to be the settled practice of the Court of Common Pleas to receive them. (See Forster v. Capewell, 1 Hilton, 47; Gottsberger v. Harned, 2 E. D. Smith, 128; Silkman v. Boiger, 4 id. 236.),As to the facts which should be shown by these affida- vits, see post, p. 1019.,ART. 9.-Dismnissal of appeal. In addition to the general rules concerning the dismis- sal of appeals, heretofore stated (ante, p. 915), there are some points of practice on the subject peculiar to these appeals, which must be noted here.,A motion to dismiss is the proper remedy in case of any defects in the notice of appeal (Webster v. Hopkins, 11 How. 140; Nye v. Ayres, 1 E. D. Smith, 532; Griswold v. Van Densen, 2 id. 178), or where it is served too late (Mills v. Shult, 2 E. D. Smith, 139); or where the return is not filed in time (ante, i. 233; Fan Heusenv. Eir7katrick, sp. t., 5 How. 442), or is defective. (See Cabre . Sturges, 1 Hilt. 160.),In moving to dismiss an appeal for want of a return, in the N. Y. Common Pleas, it is only necessary to show that the notice required by the rule (ante, i. 233), was served ten days before, and not complied with. It is not necessary to show affirmatively that the time for pio- curing the return, under Â§ 360 of the Code, has passed. (Condert v. Lias, 11 How. 264.) 1006
Dismissal of appeal. The argument. Dismissal by the court without motion.]-The court is required to dismiss an appeal without motion, when it has been for two terms upon the calendar, without being brought to a hearing by either party; unless it continues the same, for special cause shown. (Code, Â§ 364.) The court acts minist.erially, and not judicially, in complying with this requirement. (Peol)e v. Clinton Co. Judge, sp. t., 13 How. 277.) And if it acts erroneously herein, the dis- missal is void, and a mnandamus will lie to compel the court to hear the appeal. (Ib.),ART. 10.-The argumltelt.* W7tere heard.]-In cases in which a new trial is not to be had in the appellate court, the appeal must be heard at a general term thereof. (Code, Â§ 364.) Where, however, an appeal taken to a county court is transferred to the Supreme Court in consequence of the incapacity of the county judge to act in the case, it must be heard at a special term of the Supreme Court (Davis v. Stone, sp. t., 16 How. 538; Crandall v. Rogers, cited ib.; Sheldon v. Albro, 8 How. 305), held in the county where the action was originally tried, and in no other. (tiles v. Pec7k, sp. t., 16 How. 541.) Notice of argumenet.]-The appeal cannot be noticed for argument until the return of the court below is made (Code, Â§ 364); nor, if a further return is ordered, until that is made. (See .People v. Clinton Co. Judge; sp. t., 13 low. 277.) This having been done, either party may bring the appeal to a hearing upon a notice to the other of not less than eight days (Code, Â§ 364); and this notice need not be renewed at any future term, but the cause remains on the calendar until disposed of. (Id.) *This article has no bearing upon cases in which a new trial is to be had in the appellate court.,1007
APPEALS FROM JUSTICES COURTS. The argument. Papers on. Defaelt. Note of issue.]--A note of issue must be served upon the clerk of the court, at least eight days before the com. mencement of the term, and the cause will then be placed on the calendar according to the date of the return. (Code, Â§ 364.) This note of issue need not be renewed,,Papers on appeal.]-The appeal is heard on the original papers (Code, Â§ 365); and the original return, or a certified copy, must be submitted to the court. (Sm)lith v. Van Brunt, 2 E. D. Smith, 534.),Where the original return is furnished, no copies can be required for the use of the court. (Code, Â§ 365.),Default.]-We cannot say what is the practice of the county courts in such cases, but in the New York Com- mon Pleas, a judgment is never reversed as a matter of course upon the default of the respondent. A statement of some actual error, appearing upon the return, is required.* The judgment is affirmed, as of course, upon the default of the appellant, if the respondent attends; and when the cause is on the calendar for a second term, this will be done, although the respondent did not notice the appeal for argument. (Towlnslheul v. Keenan, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 544.),The argument.]-The New York Common Pleas for- merly required these appeals to be submitted on written points (see ante, i. 233), but now require them to be orally argued (ante, i. 234); and the court enforces the utmost brevity and dispatch.,The court is bound to hear and pass upon, at the same time, the whole case, including all questions of law or of fact, and any application for relief from default below. (Cook v. Swift, 10 Abb. 212; 18 How. 454.) * The practice was formerly otherwise. (See Whilney v. Bayar, 2 SandÂ£ 634.),L
1009 i What may be reviewed. What objections.,ART. 11.-W'hat may be reviewed on appeal. Only the return.]-Where a return is made, nothing can be taken into consideration that does not appear upon the return. (Spence v. Beek, 1 Hilt. 276; Kilpatrick v. Carr, 3 Abb. 117; Rawson v. Grow, 4 E. D. Smith, 18; Trust v. Delaplaile, 3 id. 219; Lynsky v. Pendegrast, 2 id. 43; Cape- well v. Ormsby, id. 180; Hyland v. Sherman, id. 234.) It cannot be contradicted by affidavits or other evidence. (lb.; Beebe v. Roberts, 3 E. D. Smith, 194; Bates v. Conk- ling, 10 Wend. 389.),,Exceptions not requirred.]-A mere objection, without any formal exception, is sufficient to raise a point for review in the appellate court. (See Meech v. Brown, 1 Hilt. 257; 4 Abb. 19.),Objections not properly raised below..]-In conformity to the general rule upon this point (see ante, p. 912), objec- tions which might have been obviated if properly raised in the court below, but whvich were not taken there at all (Jeneks v. Smith, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst. 90; Gelhaar v. Ross, 1 Hilt. 117; Whitlock v. Btueno, id. 72; Fennt v. Timlpson, 4 E. D. Smith, 276; Ranney v. Gwvynne, 3 id. 59; Smith v. Hill, 22 Barb. 656; Dexter &c. Plankroad Co. v. Allen, 16 id. 15; Fister v. La Sue, 15 id. 323; and many other cases), or which were not taken in a form sufficiently specific to point out the precise error (Tattersall v. Bass, 1 Hilt. 56; Pollock v. Hoag, 4 B. D. Smith, 473; Dunham v. sinmons, 3 Hill, 669), will not be considered on appeal. As to reviewing objections not specified by the notice of appeal, see ante, p. 995. Errors offact.]-The Code (Â§ 366), expressly authorizes the review of errors of fact. But by this, according to the weight of authority, is not to be understood an erroneous finding upon a question of fact, but facts which are not put in issue in the cause,,127
What may be reviewed. Errors of fact. such as the infancy, marriage, death, &c., of some of the parties. (Biglow v. Sanders, 22 Barb. 147; Fitch v. Devlin, 15 id. 47; Easson v. Mills, 8 How. 377; Adsit v. Wilson, 7 id. 64; see Thurber v. Townsend, 22 N. Y. 517.) It has therefore been frequently decided that the appellate court has no power to review the determination of a question of fact arising upon a conflict of evidence, no matter how greatly the weight of evidence may be against the con. clusion arrived at below (ib.; see also Bennett v. Scutt, 18 Barb. 347; Parjcer v. Baton, 25 id. 122; Rogers v. Acker. man, 22 id. 134; Wiley v. Slater, id. 506; Conklin v. Thompson, 29 id. 218; Cox v. Westchester Turnpike Co., 33 id. 414; Smith v. Hoose, 22 How. 402); and that even a question of fact upon which there was not actually con- flicting evidence, but evidence which might lead different minds to different conclusions, could not be re-examined. (Birdseye v. Frost, 34 Barb. 367.) In other cases, mostly in the New York Common Pleas, the power of the court to review the evidence, and to reverse a judgment when so clearly against the weight of evidence as to indicate cor- ruption, prejudice, partiality, or mistake, has been taken for granted, though not exercised. (See Tracy v. Hart. man, 1 Hilt. 350; Mendell v. French, 2' id. 178; Dempse v. Paige, 4 E. D. Smith, 218; Rivara v. Ghio, 3 id. 264.),It is our own impression that the legislature intended to authorize a review of questions of fact generally upon these appeals, and to confer upon the appellate court the powers exercised by a court of record on motions for new trials. There is no other remedy against the mistakes or prejudices of juries or justices, and no one can doubt that such errors are quite as frequent in justices' courts as in superior tribunals. Moreover, as it is the duty of a justice to nonsuit thl plaintiff when the weight of evidence is very decidedly against him (see ante, p. 478), and an excep- tion to his refusal is reviewable on appeal (Falesq ZlKeon, 2 Hilt. 53), while he cannot be required to charge,;.~.,----------- 1010
What may be reviewed. Errors of fact. Discretion. the jury at all (Pettit v. Ide, 12 Abb. 44), the result is that the tules laid down by the decisions make it impossible for the plaintiff to correct an erroneous finding against him, in respect of the weight of evidence, while the defend- ant has the privilege, under the form of an exception to a refusal to nonsuit.,The non-residence of a defendant (Willins v. Whteeler, 28 Barb. 668; 8 Abb. 116; 17 Abb. 93), or the non-service of process (Fitch v. Devlin, 15 Barb. 47), or irregularities of the jury (Rose v. Smith, 4 Cow. 17; Hlarvey v. Rickett, 15 Johns. 87), or improper dealings with them (Crawn v. Daly, sp. t., 2 Code Rep. 118), may be shown by affidavit, as errors in fact. But where a constable has duly returned the process as served, the fact cannot be disproved by affidavit on appeal. (Hffaigwey v. Wilson, 1 Hilt. 259; Carroll v. Goslin, 2 E. D. Smith, 376; but see contra, Pitch v. Devlil, supra.),Matters of discretion.]l-It has usually been held that mere matters of practice and discretion, not affecting any substantial right of the appellant, cannot be reviewed. (Mitecell v. Menkle, 1 Hilt. 142; Brown v. Jones, id. 204; 3 Abb. 80.) , Thus the allowance of an amendment to the summons, changing it from contract to tort (Cooper v. Kinney, 2 Hilt. 12; 6 Abb. 380), the denial of an adjournment not claim- able as of right (Ranney v. Gwynne, 3 E. D. Smith, 59; see Story v. Bishop, 4 id. 423),* the allowance of a leading question, unless it is plain that the justice has abused his discretion (Seymour v. Bradfield, 35 Barb. 49), the admis- sion of evidence after the parties had rested, but before the cause was finally submitted, and while all parties were present (Harpel v. iartis, 1 E. D. Smith, 78), and the refusal to admit evidence after the party offering it Â« """' '~"- - -- - " - " -""- -' ---- ' *But in -rroy v. Nathaan (4 E. D.

Wilson, 31 Barb. 656), have been held not reviewable. Yet a refusal to receive evi- dence on the part of the plaintiff after he had rested, no evidence having been given on behalf of the defendant, has been reviewed on appeal. (Lewis v. Ryder, 13 Abb. 1.),Inasmich as a justice of the peace cannot correct his own errors of discretion, and there is no remedy open to suitors except by appeal, it seems to us very desirable that the appellate courts shouldy-if possible; review and correct such errors, which doubtless are more frequent in these inferior courts than in courts of record. It may be that they are without power to do so, but it would be well if they had such power.,As on other appeals (see ante, p. 886) a decision upon a matter of discretion, not rendered as of discretion, but as a matter of right, is reviewable. (Peck v. Andrews, 32 Barb. 445.),A justice has no discretion in regard to amendments which merely put into proper form the claim or defense which the party intended to set up, and if he refuses to allow such amendments, the judgmentmust be reversed. (Turcec v. Richmond, 13 Barb. 533; Smith v. Mitten, 13 How. 325.),ART. 12,-Powers of tlw court. In giving judgment, the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all of the parties, and for errors of law or fact. (Code, Â§ 366.),Partial reversal.]-The court may reverse a judgment for money as to part of the amount, and affirm it as to the rest (Code, Â§ 366; see Pin ekney v. Keyler, 4 E. D. Smith, 469; Rosenbaum v. Gunter, 3 id. 203); and this even where the judgment is for entire damages. (Decker v. Hassd, 1012
Powers of court. PÂ· rinciples of determination. 26 How. 528; Fields v. Moul, 15 Abb. 6;. overruling iasson v. Mills, 8 How. 377.),Where a defendant was entitled to a judgment of dis- missal in the justice's court, but was erroneously allowed a judgment for damages on a counterclaim, the appellate court reversed the judgment so far as it allowed damages, and affirmed it as a mere judgment of dismissal. (Norris v. Bleakley, 1 Hilt. 90.),Where the amount of the judgment is too large, the court may affirm the judgment on condition that the re- spondent remits the excess. (La Motte v. Archer, 4 E. D. Smith, 46.),What judgment may be rendered in favor of appe7llat.] The New York Common Pleas has always held that it had no power to award a new 'rial on reversal, or to render a final judgment against Lde claim of the respond- cut; considering that Â§ 330 of the Code did not apply to these appeals. (See Norris v. Bleakley, 1 Hilt. 90; 'Ellert v. Kelly, 10 How. 392; 4 E. D. Smith, 12; Fraser v. Child, 4 E. D. Smith, 243.) We are unable, however, to perceive any ground for such an opinion. The court cannot increase the amount of a judgment in favor of the appellant, even where it was rendered, by an acknowledged mistake, for too small an amount. (Hardy v. Seelye, 1 Hilt. 90; 3 Abb. 103.),ART. 13.-Principles of determination. The court must give judgment according to the justice of, the case, without regard to technical errors or defects which do not affect the merits. (Code, Â§ 366.) Pres2umpticns..-Aii reasonable presumptions will be made in support of the judgment, so far as the, regularity of the proceedings before the justice is concerned (Bellovws Y. Sackett, 15 Barb. 96; Decker v. Hassel, 26 How.. 528), and nothing will be presumed against it. (Foster v. Hazen,,1013
Principles of determination. Presumptions. 12 Barb. 547-; Graves v. McKEon, 2 Denio, 639; Fan Slyclc v. Taylor, 9 Johns. 146; see La Motte v. Arleer, 4 E. D. Smith, 46.),Thus, unless the contrary appears by the return,:it will be presumed, if necessary, to support the judg- ment, that the justice waited an hour before proceeding to trial (Stafford v. Williams, 4 Den. 182), that the wit nesses were duly sworn (House v. Low, 2 Johns. 378), or that the oath was waived by consent (ib.), that an ob- jection, the grounds of which do not appear, was properly sustained or overruled (Bellows v. SaJckett, 15 Barb. 96), that the justice openly stated his reasons for his decisions (Decker v. Hassel, 26 How. 528), that the cause was sub- mitted before the judgment was rendered (Peters v. Diossy, 3 E.,D. Smith, 115), and where the trial commenced on the 11th, and judgment was rendered on the 12th, that the cause was adjourned, and the verdict rendered on the 12th (Beattie v. Qua, 15 Barb. 132), or where more than $5 costs were allowed, that foreign witnesses had been examined. (Oaklley v. Fan Horn, 21 Wend. 305; Fuller v. Wilcoz, 19 id. 351') Unless it clearly appears that the judgment was rendered on Sunday, it will be presumed that it was not. (Tower v. Hewett, 11 Johns. 134.),Where the return stated that judgment was given "for damages, with costs, $2.74," without saying for whom, it was presumed that it was in favor of the plaintiff, as a judgment for damages could not be given in favor of the defendant. (Slaman v. Buckley, 29 Barb. 289.),But nothing will be presumed in aid of the jurisdielion of the court below. Nor is the court at liberty to presume that there was any evidence given at the trial, not stated in the return. On the contrary, it must be assumed that the return contains all the evidence. (Orcutt v. Cahil, 24 N. Y. 578; Calligan v. Mix, 12 How. 495.) And whereit appears by the return that the jury retired, it will not bb presumed that an officer was sent with them.

Ide, 12 Abb. 44), yet if he does charge, the judgment muss be reversed for any error in the charge which might have misled the jury (ib.); or for his refusal to charge according to a proper request (De Benedetti v. Mauchin, 1 Hilt. 213; .Halloran v. N. Y. &, Erie R. R., 2 E. D. Smith, 257); but not if the court csa: gee with certainty that the error did not affect the verdict. (Needles v. Howard, 1 E. D. Smith, 54.) Adiission or exclusion of evidence.]-The judgment must be reversed, if any illegal evidence was admitted under objection, which could by any possibility have influenced the verdict (Main v. Eagle, 1 E. D. Smith, 621; Hahn v. Van Doren, id. 411; see Belden v. Nicolay, 4 id. 14); or if competent evidence was excluded, which might possibly have changed the result, notwithstanding the court may be of opinion that it would not have done so. (McAllister v. Sexton, 4 E. D. Smith, 41; see Raymond v. Riwlmrdson, id. 171.),The admission of illegal evidence is not cured by a subsequent direction to the jury to disregard it (Tuttle v. Hunt, 2 Oo#. 436; Irvine v. Cook, 15 Johns. 239; Penfield v.. Carpender, 13 id. 350); nor by a certificate of the jus- tice, trying the cause without a jury, that he disregarded it. (Haswell v. Bussing, 10 Johns. 128; but see Martin v. :Garrett, 4 E. D. Smith, 346.),But a judgment should not be reversed on account of the admission of imcompetent testimony in proof of a fact which was established by other competent and uncon- tradicted evidence (Bort v. Smith, 5 Barb. 283), or of evi- dence which, though illegal, could not possibly affect the result. (Moore v. Sonerindyke, 1 Hilt. 199; Martin v. .Garrett, 4 E. D. Smith, 346.),1015
Principles of determination. Admission of evidence. The Supreme Court in the fourth district have gone so far as to refuse to reverse, where there was sufficient evi. dence in the case to warrant the judgment, notwithstand- ing other evidence, clearly illegal, and manifestly tending to influence the result, was admitted. (Buck v. Waterbuty, 13 Barb. 116; Spencer v. Saratoga & Wash. . R ., 12 id. 382.) But this ruling can never be sustained, so long as the courts hold that they cannot reverse a judgment as against the weight of evidence. It would be grossly unjust to appellants to look into the weight of evidence for the sake of affirming the judgment, and to refuse to do so where it is palpable that the result of such an examination would dictate a reversal.,Though the defendant did not appear on the trial, yet the judgment should be reversed on appeal, if founded upon illegal evidence. (Squier v. Gould, 13 Wend. 159; Finc7h v. McDowall, 7 Cow. 537; McNutt v. Johnison, 7 Johns. 18.),Judgment without evidence.]-Except in the cases spe- cially provided for by the statute of 1857, allowing judg- ment to be taken by default without evidence, upon a verified complaint (see 4 E. D. Smith, 464, note), a judg- ment entirely unsupported by evidence (Davidson v. Hutchins, 1 Hilt. 123; Storp v. Harbutt, 4 . D. Smith, 464; Hunt v. Westervelt, id. 225; Calligan v. Mix, 12 How. 495; Howard v. Brown, 2 E. D. Smith, 247; Wiley v. Slater, 22 Barb. 506; Fish v. Skut, 21 id. 333; Bath- 'bone v. Stanton, 6 id. 141), or sustained by illegal evidence only (McNutt v. Johnson, 7 Johns. 18; Squier v. Gould, 14 Wend. 159; Lynch v. iMcBeth, 7 How. 113; see Finch v. McDowall, 7 Cow. 537), must be reversed, whether the defendant appeared or not.,But where the cause was evidently tried upon the assumption of a fact not proved, constituting only a link (however important) in the necessary chain of evidence, and no objection was made to the want of proof of that 1016
Principles of determination. Judgment against evidence. ._ fact, the judgment should not be reversed for such defect of proof. (Jencls v. Smith, 1 N. . Y. [1 Comst.] 90; Pruyn v. Tyler, 18 How. 331; Smith v. Hill, 22 Barb. 656; ndrewvs v. Harrington, 19 id. 343; Awcstin v. Burns, 16 id. 643.) And where the defendant did not appear on the trial, the appellate court will not be astute to discover defects in the evidence, nor so exact in judging of it, as 'it might be if the objections had been taken before the justice. (See Mayor &c. of N. Y. v. Hyatt, 3 E. D. Smith, 156.) Judgment against evidence.]-A judgment against clear, uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence, must be re- versed. (J'acls v. Darrin, 3 E. D. Smith, 557; Goldsmith v. Obermeier, id. 121; Conlan v. Latting, id. 354; see Or- culttv. Cahill, 24 X1. Y. 578; Sales v. M'Keon, 2 Hilt. 53; Fox v. Decker, 3 E. D. Smith, 150.) Where the plaintiff's assignor testified only to his belief of a material fact, but confessed himself uncertain, and the defendant testified positively to the contrary, a judgment against the latter was reversed as against evidence. (Dresser v. Van Pelt, 1 Hilt. 316.) If the county court fails to reverse such a judgment, the higher courts ought to reverse the judgment of the county court. (Wiley v. Slater, 22 Barb. 506; see Orcutt v. Cahill, 24 N. Y. 578.*) Where, however, the justice returns that a witness, whose testimony was not contradicted, testified in such manner as to discredit himself, and.that his evidence was disregarded on this account, the judgment may be affirm- ed, especially if circumstances show that the witness was not entirely trustworthy. (Donohue v. Henry, 4 E. D. Smith, 162.) So the unsupported-evidence of an inte- rested witness, such as a party to the suit, is not neces- ... * To contrary was Van VaSkenburgh v.

Gee, 15 Barb. 449.),Marine court.]-On appeal from the marine court where the general term has reversed the judgment of a special term, and granted final judgment against the party who succeeded below, in a case properly requiring a new trial, under the rule stated ante, p. 933, the Com. mon Pleas will reverse the judgment, and order a new trial at the special term of the marine court (Irwin .v. Lawrence, 1 Hilt. 352), or may send the case back to the general term below, for a correction of the judgment. (Journeay v. Brackley, 1 Hilt. 447.) If the marine court has simply reversed the judgment, without either ordering a new trial, or granting final judgment, the latter course is the only one that can be taken. (Howe or Hone v. J.Tlien, 2 Hilt. 453; 9 Abb. 193.),AST. 14.-Tjhe judgment, and its enforcement. The judgment on an appeal from a justice's court is very simple in its form, consisting almost always of a simple affirmance or reversal.,Â§ 335. JTudgmnet on appeal. [Title of cause.] [Caption],The above named ......... having appealed to this court from the judgment of [A. B. Esq., justice of the peace for the town of .........], rendered on the .. day of ........ 18.., and .. of counsel for the appellant, having been heard in support of the said appeal, and ........ of counsel for the respondent, in oppoi. tion thereto, it is now on motion of ........ , adjudged that the said judgment be affirmed [or, reversed] with ..... dollars cost,Jutdgment roll.]-The judgment must be annexed to the return, and these together constitute the judgment roll; 1018
1019 Thejudgment. Relief against default. which must be filed with the clerk of the court. (Code, Â§ 367.),Enforcement of judgment.]-No remittitur issues from the appellate court to the justice. (See Smith v. Allen, 2 ,1 D. Smith, 259, 265.) If the judgment is affirmed, the respondent is at liberty to proceed as though no appeal had been had (see ib.; Onderdonlz v. Emtmons, 2 Hilt. 504; 9 Abb. 187); and the execution for its enforcement issues out of the court below, and not out of the appellate court. (See Onderdonk v. Emmons, supra.) If the judgment is reversed, the parties are simply remitted to their original rights, and may proceed as though no action had ever been brought. (Hunt v. Hobo- Relt Land Co., 1 Hilt. 161; .Ellert v. Kelly, 4 E. D. Smith, 12; 10 How. 392.) If a new trial is had in the appellate court, of course the judgment thereon is to be enforced in that court, and the justice's judgment is wholly superseded. Setting off qosts against recovery.]-If a recovery is awarded to one party, and costs to the other, the appel- late court must set off the one against the other, and render judgment for the balance. (Code, Â§ 370.) A judg- ment thus awarded, would be necessarily enforced as a judgment of the appellate court. (Semble, Onderdonki v. Emmnons, 2 Hilt. 504; 9 Abb. 187.),ART. 15.-Relief again2st default in the court below. If the defendant failed to appear before the justice, and satisfactorily excuses his default, and it is shown that manifest injustice has been done, the court may, in its :iscretion, set aside or suspend judgment, and order a new trial before the same or any other justice, at such time and place, and on such terms as the court may deem proper. (Code, Â§ 366.)
Belief against default. On what excusea,-- - This provision is only applicable to cases in which the defendant neter appeared (Wilde v. N. Y. & Harlem; X. R., 1 Hilt. 302; lXuber v. Held, 3 Abb. 110; tilliams v McAuley, 3 E. D. Smith, 121; and see Hunt v. Westervel, 4 E. D. Smith, 225; Rawson v. Grow, id. 18); and the court has no power to grant a new trial for any cause, if the defendant appeared before the justice. (Edwiards v. Drew, 2 id. 55; Bunker v. Latson, 1 id. 410.),In the New York Common Pleas, it is held that default on an adjournment cannot be excused on appeal (ilde v. .T Y. d& Harlem B. R., 1 Hilton, 302; Miber v. Held, 3 Abb. 110; Williams v. M'AdAley, 3 E. D. Smith, 120; see Beebe v. Roberts, 3 E. D. Smith, 194); but in the Supreme Court it has been said that if a fraud is practiced upon the defendant, by which he is induced to stay away on the adjourned day, relief can be had under this section. (Armstrong v. Craig, i8 Barb. 387.),What excuses are sfficient.]-It has been held a suffi- cient excuse that the defendant's attorney went to the wrong court (in New York city, where there are several such courts), under a mistaken impression arising from unavoidable accident (Lent v. Jones, 4 E. D. Smith, 52); that the defendant's attorney, not being aware of the time, was delayed in the street by another client, until he was a few minutes too late; the plaintiff's attorney and witnesses not having left the court, and the justice being willing to take Up the case again (Seymour v. Elmer, 4 B. D. Smith, 200); that the defendant being obliged to leave town, gave the summons to a young man, with instru- tions to take it to his attorney, and request his attend- ance; which the young man forgot to do in time (Canp v. Stewart, 2 E. D. Smith, 88); that the defendant hlad good reason to believe, from the wording of the sum- mons, and the facts within his knowledge, that the action was for a claim which he admitted to be due, and for this reason did not attend; when the plaintiff took judgment L 1020
Belief from default. What excuse sufficient. for a greater amount and upon a different claim. (BisseU v. Dearn, 3 E. D. Smith, 172.) It seems that a mistake as to the time at which the summons was returnable (if shown to have been real, and itself excusable), would be a satisfactory excuse, if the defendant acted upon his mistaken impression, and ap- peared at the time which he supposed was correct. (Gard- nler v. Wight, 3 E. D. Smith, 334; Gottsberger v. Harned, 2 id. 128.) The appellant may contradict a constable's return as to the service or contents of the summons, not as a ground for disputing the validity of the judgment, but as foundation for relief by the court against mistake. (Carroll v. Goslin, 2 E. D. Smith, 376; see Haughey v. Wilson, 1 Hilt. 259.),Wh4at excuses are not sutfficient.]-Engagements else- where, either of the defendant or his counsel, are not a sufficient excuse for default. (M32Ielern v. Hyde, 3 E. D. Smith, 177; Fowler v. Colyer, 2 id. 125.) Neither is the mere statement that the defendant "forgot the time of trial" (Beebe v Roberts, 3 E. D. Smith, 194; and see Gard- ner v. Wight, id. 334), or that he was ignorant of law pro- ceedings (Mayor &c. of N. Y. v. Green, 1 Hilt. 393), or that, being in court when the cause was called, he did not hear it (see Forster v. Capewell, 1 Hilt. 47), or the fact that the assignor of the plaintiff promised to stay pro- ceedings in the action (Travis v. Bassett, 3 E. D. Smith, 171), a sufficient excuse; though a similar promise by the actual plaintiff would be a valid excuse. (See Arm- strong v. Craig, 18 Barb. 387.) Injtustice must be sholwn.]-N-ot only must the default be excused, but it must be shown that manifest injustice has been done. (Code, Â§ 366.) And without such proof of injus- fice, it will not avail the defendant to excuse his default. (Forster v. Capewell, 1 Hilt. 47; Lent v. Jones, 4 E. D.,1021
Relief from default. Affidavits. Order Smith, 52; Gottsberger v. Harned, 2 id. 128; Gardner v. Wight, 3 id. 334.),Omitting to credit the defendant with money paid on account, has been held injustice against which relief should be granted (Bissell v. Dean, 3 E. D. Smith, 172); but an omission to allow a set-off against the plaintife assignor is not. The defendant can sue upon his claim. (Travis v. Bassett, 3 E. D. Smith, 171.),What the affidavits should contain.]-An ordinary afit davit of merits is not sufficient; the nature of the defense must be disclosed. (Fowler v. Colyer, 2 E. D. Smith, 125; Armstroing v. Craig, 18 Barb. 387.) Facts must be stated and not mere conclusions claimed to be drawn from facts. (Armstrong v. Craig, 18 Barb. 387.),The defendant ought to procure corroborative affidavits, if possible, in addition to his own, for his unsupported affidavit will not suffice to discredit the positive testimony of disinterested witnesses at the trial (Sillcman v. Boiger, 4 E. D. Smith, 236; Lent v. Joanes, id. 52), nor even to over- come the affidavit of the plaintiff in contradiction (Forster v. Capeivell, 1 Hilt. 47; Van IVyck v. Kelly, 2 E. D. Smith, 128, b.), much less, where the latter is corroborated by other persons. (Gardner. v. Wight, 3 E. D. Smith, 334; Gottsberger v. Harned, 2 id. 128.),Â§ 336. Order granting relief from default. [Title of cause.] [Caption.],[As in Â§ 335 to the words "opposition thereto," and continue] and it appearing to the court that the defendant's default is Eatis factorily excused, and that manifest injustice has been done to the appellant, it is now [&ec.],ORDERED: 1.

Relief from default. New trial proceedings under the order.]-The parties must appear before the justice according to the order of the court, and the same proceedings must be had as in an ordinary action. (Code, ' 366.),ART. 16.-New trial in appellate court. In 1862, an amendment was made to the Code (Â§ 352), by which a new trial was granted in the county court, as a matter of right, irrespective of the merits of the appeal, whenever, an issue having been joined between the par- ties, the claims of either party litigated in the court below should exceed fifty dollars, or when, in an action for chattels, the value of the property as assessed, and the damages recovered, should exceed that sum; and this, if the judgment below was rendered upon an issue of fact, whether the defendant was present at the trial or not. In 1864 this provision was modified by enacting that it should not apply to appeals in which the appellant should state, in the notice of appeal, that it was taken upon ques- tions of law only. (Laws 1864, ch. 414.) The New York Common Pleas have always held that these provisions had no application to appeals in that court. We believe that the Superior Court of Buffalo took the same view; but in 1863 a further amendment was made, by which these provisions were extended to that court. Bringing on the trial.]-The notice of appeal having been served, security given, and the return filed, as pre- viously stated in this chapter, the new trial may be brought on by either party at a jury term of the court, in like manner as in the Supreme Court. (Code, Â§ 364.*) A note of issue must be filed as stated ante, p. 1008. *7te trial.]-The court must proceed to try the same issue which was made before the justice, and must con-,* As amended, 1862.,1023

(Code. Â§ 366.),'Subsequent proceedings.]-All subsequent proceedings are to be conducted as in the Supreme Court; and the appellate court may, in like manner, render judgment, grant a new trial, &c., &c. (Code, Â§ 366.),ART. 17.-Restitution. If the judgment below, or any part thereof, has been paid or collected, and the judgment is afterward reversed, the appellate court must order the amount paid or col- lected to be restored, with interest, from the time of such payment or collection. (Code, Â§ 369.) If the order is made before the judgment is entered, the amount may be included in the judgment. (Id.),The court must order restitution in the proper cases. It is not a matter of'discretion. (Semble, Estus v. Baldwin, sp. t., 9 How. i8.),This is the proper course to adopt, rather than to bring an action for the amount paid. (Kennedy v. O'Brien, 2 B. D. Smith, 41.),Order necessary.-Restitution cannot be made, as a matter of course, by the clerk. An order of the court is necessary. (Jacks v. Darrin, 1 Abb. 233.),Order, howl obtained.]-The order may be obtained on proof of the facts, made at or after the hearing, upon a previous notice of six days. (Code, Â§ 369.),A transcript of the docket, showing that the judgment has been satisfied, is sufficient evidence of payment (Huilt v. Westervelt, 4 E. D. Smith, 226); or the payment'may be shown by affidavit. (Sheridan v. Mann, sp. t., 5 Hfow 201.) 1024

Heirs, devisees, &c.]-The heirs, devisees or legatees of a deceased judgment debtor may, after the expiration of three years from the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, be summoned to show cause why the judgment should not be enforced against the estate of the judgment debtor in their hands.

ART. 1.-What are irregularities, and what nullities. Irregularity, what.]-An irregularity consists in the doing of some act in the course of an action which may lawfully be done by the person doing it, under some cir- cumstances, but which he ought not to do in the particular manner, or at the particular time, or under the particular circumstances, in which he actually does it. This is a defi- nition of our own; but it is, we think, supported by the current of decisions. Other definitions may be found in 1 Burr. Pr. 472; 1 Tidd, 512. The service of the summons by the plaintiff himself (lhunter v. Lester, sp; t., 10 Abb. 260; 18 How. 347); the issuance of an attachment against the property of a party, oI the ground of his non-residence, when he is in fact a resident (Lawrence v. Jones, 15 Abb. 110); the entry of judgment as on failure to answer, where the defendant's answer was returned to him upon an objection founded npon the plaintiff's mistake (VTan Bent7lysen v. Lyle, sp. t., 8 How. 312); the entry of a judgment against an heir in general terms, instead of restricting it to the estate inherited by him (Jacakso v. Rosevelt, 13 Johns.,IRREGULARITIES AND NULLITIES.,1027
Irregularity, what. Nullity, what. 97); a variance between the decision of a referee (Inger. soll v. Bostwick, 22 N. Y. 425), or the verdict of a jury (Jolhnson v. Carnley, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 570), and the judg. ment entered thereon (ib.), or between an order of dismissal on the minutes, and the copy inserted in the judgment roll (Martin v. Lott, sp. t., 4 Abb. 365); an appeal from a direction for judgment, before the judgment itself is entered (D'Ivernois v. ieavitt, 8 Abb. 59); the issuing of an execution for more than is due (Peet v. Cowenhoven sp. t., 14 Abb. 56); and a levy under an execution after the return day (Jackson v. Bosevelt, 13 Johns. 97; Jackson v. Bartlett, 8 id. 361); have all been held irregularities only, and not nullities.,Distinctions between irregularities.]-Irregularities are divided into two classes; those which affect the merits, and those which do not. The latter class are commonly called mere irregularities, and most of the rules and deci. sions concerning irregularities really contemplate only these.,Thus, the entry of judgment after the action has been fully settled between the parties, is not a " mere irregau larity" (Marquat v. Mulvy, 9 How. 460); and yet it clearly is not a nullity.,Irregularity can be predicated only of matters of prac tice and procedure in the course of an action.,Errors in the substance of a pleading, or errors of a judge upon points of law in the course of a trial (Craig v. Fanning, sp. t., 6 How. 336), are not irregularities.,,Nullity, what.]-A proceeding which is not authorized in any case by law, or which is taken in a case in whilc it is never allowed, irrespective of time or circumstancs, or by a person who has no authority to take it in any case, or when the court has no jurisdiction of the case (Noyes v. Butler, 6 Barb. 613; Harris v. Hardeman;'1 How. U. S. 334; Shumway v. Stillman, 6 Wend.447; 1028
Nullity, what; Remedies against irregularitie. 4 Cow. 292; Andrews v. Montgomery, 19 Johns. 162; Bor- dect v. Fitcht, 15 id. 121; Harrod v. Barretto, 1 Hall, 155'; 2 id. 302), or which is declared void by statute, or unquali- fledly prohibited thereby (Garratt v., Hooper, 1 DowL P. 0. 28; Goodwin v. Parry, 4 T. R. 577), is a nullity. Thus a sale uilder an execution against a dead person (Woodcock v. Bennett, 1 Cow. 711), or after the judgment has been satisfied (Craft v. Merrill, 14 N. Y. [4 Kern.] 427; Wood v. Colvin, 2 Hill, 566); or a judgment entered without any service of summons upon, or appearance by, the defendant (Hallett v. Rigliters, sp. t., 13 How. 43; sroyes v. Butler, and other cases cited supra); is not merely irregular, but utterly void.,ART. 2.-Remiedies against irregularities. Whlo may object.]-No one but a party (Abels v. Wester; velt, 15 Abb. 305; Oakley v. Becker, 2 Cow. 454; see Tan Alstyle v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489; Bacon v. Cropsey, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.] 195) affected thereby (Green vr Pledger, 3 Hare, 165) can object to an irregularity. . By inotionj.]-An irregularity is a ground for motion only, and never for an appeal, until such motion has been made and denied. (Ante, p. 926; Ingersoll v. Bostwick7, 22 N. Y. 425; Johnson v. Carnley, 10 N. Y. [6 Seld.] 570; Rogers v. Hosack, 18 Wend. 319.),When objection to be made.]-An objection on the ground of mnere irregularity, whether by the way of motion or otherwise; must be made promptly, at the first opportu- tiity after the objector is aware of the facts (Lawrence v- Jones, 15 Abb. 110; Mayor &c. of N.

Murrells, 5 Hurlst. & N. 813); or the delay must be excused, especially if the case is without merits. (Cagger v. Gardner, sp. t., 1 How. 142; see Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427.),Delay is sufficiently excused by showing that the party complaining was ignorant of the facts constituting the irregularity (Giles v. Caines, 3 Cai. 107), or that the motion was noticed for a previous term, at which it could not be heard (Whipple v. Williams, sp. t., 4 How. 28); but no by his (Currey v. Bowker, 9 Dowl. P. 0. 523; see Maltby v. Murrells, 5 Hurlst. & N. 813) or his attorney's (More- land v. Sanford, 1 Den. 660) ignorance of the practice, or of the law in general; nor by his being a prisoner. (Prim- rose v. Baddeley, 2 Cr. & M. 468; Claridge v. Mackenzie, 5 Man. & Gr. 251.),Where a debtor was arrested in the county of A. by a sheriff of the county of B., the court refused to discharge him on motion, after ten month's delay, though he was not aware that he was arrested in A., until he applied for relief. (Greenshield v. Pritchard, 8 Mees. & W. 148.),These strict rules do not apply to objections to irregu- larities affecting a substantial right. (Lucas v. Second Baptist Church, sp. t., 4 How. 353; Doty v. Bussell, 5 Wend. 129.),A mere notice that a party intends to take an irregular step, imposes no obligation upon the adverse party to move against it. (Yandenburgh v. Van Rensselaer, 6 Paige, 147.) i -1030
IRREGULARITIES AND NULLITIES.,1031 R emedies against irregularities. Judgments. TlJdgments.]-A judgment cannot be set aside for any irregularity, after the lapse of one year from its entry (3 B. S. (5th ed.) 637; [2 id. 359]), and this, we presume, whether known to the party or not. A motion to set aside a judgment on the pleadings, on the ground that no order for judgment has been entered, is within this provi- Ã³ion. (Whtitelead v. Pecare, sp. t., 9 How. 35.) The section has been construed as making a motion too late, if noticed for a day after the year, though the notice is served within the year (Cook v. Dickerson, 1 Duer, 679); but this seems to us *too harsh an interpretation of the statute. This provision applies only to mere technical irregular- ities, and not to the entry of judgment without authority, as where it is entered by default, before the defendant's time to plead has expired (Harris v. Warren, sp. t., 1 How. 139), or entered against a party of whom the court has not jurisdiction (Hallett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 43; )Dederick v. Richley, 19 Wend. 108; Manltfs & Meci. B'k. v. Boyd, 3 Den. 257), or if it affects the rights of third parties. (Chaplpell v. Chanpell, 12 N. Y. [2 Kern.] 215; Bonwell v. Hery, sp. t., 13 How. 142.) After a very great lapse of time, however (e. g., ten years), a judgment will not be set aside even for an irregu- larity of a substantial nature (Soulden v. Cook, 4 Wend. 217), so long as it is not absolutely void. See further on this subject, ante, p. 723. The ntotion.]-The notice of motion (or order to show :cause) to set aside a proceeding for irregularity must specify the irregularity (Rule 39, Supreme Ct.; Gtzrnee v. Hoxie, 29 Barb. 547); and if it does not, the motion must be denied. (Gurnee v. Hoxie, supra; Barker v. Cook, 40 Barb. 254; 16 Abb. 83.) It is not enough that the affi- davit (if any) on which the motion is founded, specifies the irregularity. The notice must do so. (Coit v. Lambeer, 8p. t., 2 Code Rep. 79.):
Remedies against irrcgularities. A 'ainst nnllitie.,-- This rule does not apply to a creditor's motion to set aside a judgment by confession as founded upon an in. sufficient statement. (Winnebrenner v. Edgerton, sp. t., 30 Barb. 185; 8 Abb. 419; 17 How. 363.),A statement in the notice to set aside a judgment, that it was improperly entered, will sustain an objection that it was entered without authority. (Hicks v. Brennan, sp. t., 10 Abb. 304.),Where several objections on the grounl of irregularity exist, they must all be raised in one motion. All not specified on the first motion, are waived. (Ante, i. 398; Thorpe v. Beer, 2 Barn. & Aid. 273.) And if a motion is made to set aside a proceeding as irregular, and denied, a new motion to set it aside as a nullity, upon facts known at the time of the first motion, must be denied (Anderson v. Harrison, 13 L. J. [Q. B.] 293.),Principles of determiniationJ.-A proceeding clearly ir- regular, and not within the saving clause of the Code (Â§ 176) enabling the court to disregard errors which do not prejudice, must be set aside on motion duly made, whether the applicant has merits or not.' (Hughes v. Wood, 5 Duer, 603 n.),Extent of relief.]-On a motion grounded upon irregn- larity, only the irregular proceedings should be set aside. Thus, if a default is regularly taken, it is not to be vacated on account of the irregularity of subsequent proceedings. (Griswold v. Stouglton, 1 Cai. 6.) If an inquest is regular, and the judgment entered thereon is irregular, the latter only must be set aside, and the former must stand. (Birger v. Baker, sp. t., 4 Abb. 11.),ART. 3.-Remedies against nullities. A proceeding that is utterly void may be disregarded (Hunt v. Wallis, 6 Paige, 371; Spencer v. Barber, 5 ill, 568); but a party whose rights are apparently affected 1032
Waiver. What may bo waived. How made. thereby may move. to set it aside. (Harris v. Clark, sp. t., 10 How. 415, 424.),ART. 4.-Waiver. What may be waived.l-An irregularity of any kind, including any objection which does not go to the juris- diction of the court, may be waived. It has generally been said, in rather loose language, that a nullity cannot be waived (Garratt v. Hooper, 1 Dowl. P. 0. 28; Roberts v. lpurr, 3 id. 551; Goodwin v. Parry, 4 T. R. 577); but in a recent case (Maltby v. Mir- edls, 5 Hurlst. & N. 813), BIRnAMWELI and CIHAIELL, BB., expressed the opinion that any objection not appear- ing on the record might be waived, whetler the defect made the proceeding merely irregular or wholly void. . It seems to us that the true rule is, as we have said, that any objection which does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, beyond the power of the parties to give it to them, may be waived; and that the distinction between nullities and mere irregularities is to be found in the mode, rather than the power of waiver. Thus, there can be no question that an appeal taken by service of notice on the clerk alone, and not on the attorney, is utterly void; yet there can also be no doubt that the appeal could be made valid by express consent. And so where any other notice is entirely omitted. (See ez parte Crosby, 8 Cow. 119.) Waiver, holw imade.]-Any irregularity may be waived, by consent, either verbal or written (Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Rcid. 3 Edw. Oh. 414; Ex parte Crosnjy, 8 Cow. 119), or by positive acquiescence. (Maltby v. Mi~r- rells, 5 Hurlst. & N. 813.) A "mere" irregularity, that is, one not affecting a sub- stantial right, is waived, provided the party is aware of the facts, but not otherwise (Giles v. Caines, 3 Cai. 107; Coxv. Tullock, 2 Dowl. P. 0. 47), by neglecting to com-,130,1033
Waivex. How made. plain of it in due season (Fulton Bank v. Beach [Ct. of Errors], 6 Wend. 36, 43; Skinner v. Dayton, 5 Johns. Oh. 192; Brasher v. Cortlandt, 2 id. 242), or by acting upon the irregular proceeding, without objection. (D'Ivernois v. Leavitt, 8 Abb. 59; Francis v. Ross, sp. t., 17 How. 561; Bouton v. Brooklyn, 2 Wend. 395; see Farmnrs' Loan & Trust Co. v. Reid, 3 Edw. Oh. 414.),But an irregularity affecting a substantial right is not deemed waived by slight delay (see ante, p. 1030), and a nullity cannot be waived by any delay (Johnston v. Bloomer, 3 Edw. Ch. 328) or subsequent step. (Roberts v. Spurr, 3 Dowl. P. C. 551; Garratt v. Hooper, 1 id. 28; Hansen v. S7tackelton, 4 id. 48; Taylor v. Phillips, 3 East, 155; Goodwi;t v. Parry, 4 T. R. 577; Morgan v. Johnson, 1 H. Blacks. 628.),A general appearance waives all irregularities in tle summons or its service, then known to the defendant. (Ante, i. 389.),The want of authority for an amendment is waived by retaining the amended pleading for any length of time without objection. (Hollister v. Livingston, sp. t., 9 How. 140.) But the contrary was held as to a pleading served after the time to plead had expired. (Baker v. Curtiss, sp. t., 7 How. 478.),As to waiver of objections to a verification, see ante, p. 42. As to waiver of other objections to pleadings, see ante, pp. 81, 133, 135, 178, 197. 1034

In a hasty opinion, delivered at an early period of its existence, the Court of Appeals intimated that an affida- vit might not be amendable (Clicmina v. Clicknman, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 611); but it undoubtedly is. (Bowman v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 657.),What is not.]-An absolute nullity, that is, a paper or proceding not merely voidable but utterly void, cannot be amended. (Kendall v. Washburn, sp. t., 14 How. 380; Halett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 id. 43; Clarke v. Miller, 18 Barb. 269; People v. Superior Court, 18 Wend. 675; Burk v. Barnard, 4 Johns. 309; Bult v. Thomas, 2 id. 109.) Thus, if process is issued out of the wrong court, the mistake is not amendable. (Clarke v. Mille; People v. Superior Ct., supra.) And if the court has never obtained jurisdiction of the cause, it has no power to amend the proceedings by which the plaintiff sought to give it juris- diction. (Kendall v. Washblurn, supra; Hallett v. Righters, -upra; see Lynch v. Mechanics' Bank, 13 Johns. 127.),1035
MISTAKES AND AMENDMENTS. General ?rinciples. Power of the coit.,ART. 2.-General principles. Power of the court.]-The power of the court to allow amendments is not limited by the statutes on the subject. It may allow amendments, on equitable grounds, in cases beyond the provisions of the statute. (Weed v. Saratoga & Schenectady R. R., 19 Wend. 534.) Every court of record has now the same power to amend, in every species of action, independently of the terms of the statutes, which a court of equity formerly had.,Under the Revised Statutes, the court in which any action was pending might, before judgment, amend any process, pleading, or proceeding therein, either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice, on such terms as should be just (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 721; [2 id. 424, Â§ 1]); and after verdict, the court was bound to disregard defects not against the justice of the suit, and not altering the issue, but to amend (id. Â§ 7); and was also bound, after judgment, to allow amendments in matters of form, in affirmance of the judgment; and to amend variances :i the record, from any process, pleading, or proceeding. (Id. Â§ 4.),These provisions extended to all:actions in courts of law, and to all suits for the recovery of any debt due to the people of this state, or for any debt, duty or revenue belonging to them; and also to all actions for penalties and forfeitures; to all writs of mandamus and prohibition; to all informations in the nature of a quo warrantto; to writs of scire facias; and to the proceedings therein. (Id.,o10.) The Code, in a spirit of greater liberality, provides that the court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on. such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process or proceeding, by adding or striling out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations materal to the case, or when the amendment does not change sub stantially the claim or defense, by conforming the plead'
General principles. What court may grant amendments. ing or proceeding to the facts proved. (Code, Â§ 173.) The court may also allow an act to be done, after the time limited, or enlarge the time; and may, within one year, relieve from mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect, and may supply an omission in any proceeding; and whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of the Code, the court may, in like manner, and upon like terms, permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it conformable thereto. (Code, Â§ 174.) :The provisions of the Itevised Statutes authorizing amendments are not repealed by the Code, but are to be considered in connection with the further powers con- ferred by the Code. (Brown v. Babcoc7k, 3 How. 305; 1 Code Rep. 66; see Agreda v. baulberg, 3 E. D. Smith, 178; Perry v. Tynen, 22 Barb. 137; Prindle v. Aldrich, 13 How. 466.) It is only when an amendment is sought in order to conform the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved, that the court is restricted from allowing an amendment which changes the nature of the claim or defense. (Daguerre v. Orser, sp. t., 3 Abb. 86.),Witat court may grant amendmlent.]-No court can amend proceedings in another court. (Bucitan v. Sum- ner, 2 Barb. Oh. U. 165.),On appeal, the appellate court has the same power to amend matters brought before it for review, as the court below had. (Ch7eeth7am v. Tillotson [Ot. of Errors], 4 Johns. 499; Pease v. Morgan, 7 id. 468; Coster v. Pklunix, 7 Cow. 624; but see contra, Gould v. Glass, 19 Barb. 179.) It can even amend the proceedings which were taken to secure the right of appeal, such as the undertaking, notice, &c., if not absolutely void. '(Wood v. Kelly, 2 Hilt. 334.*) - *B paire Chrysli (4 Cow. 80), to the contrary, was, of course, decided prior to the Code.,1037
General principles. Delay. An amendment may also be made by tle court below, notwithstanding the appeal. (Luysten v.. iffen, sp. t., 1 Barb. 428; 3 How. 250; Rewl v. Barker, 2 Cow. 408; Tillotson v. Cheetthat, 3 Johns. 95.),Amendnment not a r'ight.]-Ameundments are said to bo matter of favor, in all cases. and not of strict right. (Hat. field v. Secor, 1 Hilt. 535.),This is true, in respect tc all amendments which ara made discretionary by statute, but not with regard to suck as are expressly commanded to be made. (See White v.,lSencer, 14 N. Y. 247.) Delay.]-An application for leave to amend should be made promptly after its necessity is discovered. (See Saltus v. Genin, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 639; 8 Abb. 253; Rogers v. Rogers, 1 Paige, 188.) Delay is highly prejudicial to the motion. (lb.; see Burr v. Burr, 2 Edw. Ch. 448; Gouv- errnezr v. Elmicendof, 4 Johns. Ch. 357.) But it is not by this to be understood that it is always necessary to move promptly upon discovering the mistake or error. If it is of such a nature as not to affect any present rights, and no objection has been made to it by any party, there is no necessity to move until an objection is made, if the party who made the mistake is willing to run the risk of the intervention of bolnafide purchasers, &c.,.Mistakes of court or its oficers.]-The court never allows a party to be prejudiced by its own delay or mistake (Clapp v. Graves, 2 Hilt. 317; 9 Abb. 20), unless com- pelled to do so by statute (see Wait v. FVa Allen, 22 N. Y. 319); nor by the mistakes of its officers (Chichester v. Calde, 3 Cow. 39; Mechanics' Bank v. .Minthtorne, 19 Johns. 244; Seaman v. Drake, 1 Cai. 9; see Bascon v. Feazler, sp. t., 2 How. 16), among whom are included the attorneys prac- ticing in the court. (Neele v. Berryltill, sp. t., 4 How. 16; Close v. Gillespey, 3 Johns. 526.) But as the attorney of

Amendments without motion. party is Iris agent, as well as an officer of the court, relief will not be given against his mistakes, to the preju- dice of third persons who have meantime acquired rights in good faith. (Bank of Rochester v. EEmerson, 10 Paige, 359.) A mere technical error, however, which leaves no doubt as to what was intended, is not one on which a third person can in good faith rely, and it may therefore be amended to his prejudice. (Close v. Gillespey, supra.),Useless amednment.]-The court will not grant leave to amend, where the amendment would be wholly unavail- ing to save trouble and expense, or to secure the rights of the amending party. (See Von Becck v. Shulinan, sp. t., 13 How. 472; Ten Eick v. Simpson, 11 Paigc, 177.),Actions not favored.]-Tlie court does not favor actions or defenses in which it is sought to enforce a penalty or forfeiture, and will grant, in such cases, only such amend- ments as it is bound to grant by statute. (Gasper vAldamns, 24 Barb. 287; Beach v. Ftlton Bank, 3 Wend. 573; Lotw v. Little, 17 Johns. 346.),The statutory rules in relation to amendments in ac- tions for penalties and forfeitures (Barber v. iMlcenry, 6 VWend. 516), or defenses involving a forfeiture (Catlin v. Guinter, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 368), are the same as in rela- tion to other actions or defenses.,Amendmenlt without )motionI.]-Amendments may be granted on denying a motion to set aside the proceedings, without requiring the party amending to make a formal motion onu his part (Jones v. Williams, 4 Hill, 34; Inmoan v. Griswold, 1 Cow. 199; Wright v. Alden, sp. t., 3 How. 213; Spalding v. Spalding, sp. t., 3 id. 297; see Lewis v. Jones, sp. t., 13 Abb. 427; fissan& v. Ml:arsludl, sp. t., 10 id. 424; Davison v. Powell, sp. t., 13 How. 287), and so, under the old practice, leave to amend might be given on a motion in arrest of judgment. (Thomas v. Leonard, 11,1039
General principles. Amendment of process. Wend. 53; Norris v. Durham, 9 Cow. 151.) On demur- rer, an amendment has been allowed to obviate the ground of demurrer, and judgment rendered against the demur. rant (People v. Walker, sp. t., 23 Barb. 304; 2 Abb. 421); but this is an uncommon and questionable exercise of power. It is, however, both usual and proper to allow a pleading to be amended on terms on allowing a demurrer.,On a motion for judgment on failure to answer, the court would not amend the form of the summons, in respect to the demand of relief. (Diblee v. Mason, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 37; 6 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 363.) And where nothing was brought out on the motion to justify an amendment, it was refused. (Seymour v. Van Curen, sp. t., 18 How. 94.),ART. 3.-Amenzdmenlt of process. Process generally.]--A writ tested on Sunday (WFillials v. Hogeboom, 22 Wend. 648; Boyd v. Vandcrkelmp, 1 Barb. Ch. 273, 289), or otherwise irregularly tested as to time (Gordon v. Valentine, 16 Johns. 145) or place (Raymond v. Hinman, 4 Cow. 41), or the teste of which omits the official title of the justice (People v. Albany Mayor's Court, 9 Wend. 486), or is wrong in respect to the name of the justice (Brown v. Aplin, 1 Cow. 283; Henry-'v. Henry, sp. t., 1 How. 167; Spooner v. Frost, sp. t., id. 192), or which is not tested at all (M'Intyre v. lRowan, 3 Johns. 144), or mentioning no place of return (Cutler v. Rathbone, 1 Hill, 204), or wrong in respect to the place of return (MicCo(oney v. Glen, 1 Cow. 141), or made returnable "before us," instead of "before our justices" ('Williams v. Rogers, 5 Johns. 163; Morrell v. Waggoner, id. 233), or returnable on Sunday* (Anstice v. White, 1 Am. Law Rep. 152; see Boyd v. Vanderkemp, 1 Barb. Ch. R. 289; Stone v. * There is no exception now to this rule, inasmuch as there is now no writ by which an action may be commenced, and the defendant arrested, which was the only exception under the old practice. (2 R. S., 424, Â§ 3.) 1040
Amendment of process. Summons. Martin, 2 Denio, 185), or directed to the sheriff when it should be directed to the coroner (Bronson v. Earl, 17 Johns. 63), is amendable.,But process issued out of the wrong court is not amend- able. (Clarke v. Miller, 18 Barb. 269.) ,gSnmons.]-A summons cannot be amended without leave of the court. It is not a pleading but process. (Mc'rane v. 3oulton, 3 Sands. 736; see Follower v. Laugh- lin, 12 Abb. 105.) It may be amended by increasing the amount of the demand (Deane v. O'Brien, sp. t., 13 Abb. 11), or by con- for;ing the notice of judgment in case of default to the nature of the complaint (Norton v. Cary, sp. t., 14 Abb. 364; 23 How. 469), or by adding new parties (Follower v. Laughlin, 12 Abb. 105), or correcting mistakes as to the names or description of parties (M'Elvwain v. Corning, 12 Abb. 16), subject to the general principles elsewhlre stated in regard to amendments as to parties. A summons containing no reference to the court in which the action is brought may be amended, if the com- plaint subsequently served sufficiently names the court (Walkcer v. Hubbard, sp. t., 4 How. 154); but not if the name of the court is omitted, both in the summons and complaint. In such case there is no suit commenced in any court. (Ward v. Stringham, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 118.) Where a summons has been served, not naming any court, and judgment is entered by default, without any appearance by defendant, on granting leave to amend, the defendant must have leave to answer, though he makes no affidavit of merits. (James v. Kir7cpatrick, sp. t., 5 How. 241.) A summons issued in the name of an agent, not an attorney, was allowed to be amended, where the statute of limitations would otherwise intervene. (Weare or Weir v. Sloclim, 1 Code Rep. 105; 3 How. 397.),131,1041
Amendment of process. Summons. Execution. A summons, which states that the complaint is "an- nexed," when, in fact, no complaint is annexed, and which omits to state when and where a complaint will be filed, is not a nullity, and may be amended, if injustice will not be done thereby. (Keeler v. Belts, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 183.),Even after judgment, the court has the power to amend the summons by substituting the individual name of an attorney for that of his firm (Sltyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673); or by inserting in the copy of the summons filed, the names of defendants actually served with the sum- mons, or appearing in the action. (Fan Wyck v. Hardy, 11 Abb. 473; 20 How. 222.),Great delay in serving the complaint, after service of a summons, is not a conclusive objection to amending the summons (MacElwain v. Corning, 12 Abb. 16); but the de- fendant should be protected from prejudice by reason of any act done by him in good faith meanwhile. (Ib.),Execution.]-An execution made returnable on Sunday, may be amended by changing the return day. (Stone v. .lMartin, 2 Den. 185.),An execution against property having been accidentally destroyed, after levy, the court ordered a new one to be made out and delivered to the sheriff, mine pro tunce. (W7tite v. Lovejoy, 3 Johns. 448.),Where the usual direction to levy on real property is omitted (Lansing v. Lansing, 18 Johns. 502), or has been inserted in a case in which it is not allowable (Stephens v. Browning, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 123); or where the amount directed to be levied slightly exceeds the amount of the judgment (Holmes v. Williams, 3 Cai. 98; see Bissell v. Kip, 5 Johns. 89, 101); or if a part of the debt being paid, the direction to levy is for the full amount, but no more than is actually due is really collected (see Peck v. Tiffany, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 451; Peet v. Cowen7loven, sp. t., 14 Abb. 56); or if only one of the defendants having been served with process, the indorsement required by statute is 1042

Westervelt, 15 Abb. 230); or if the judg- ment is recited as having been recovered in a different court from that in which it really was rendered (ib.); or if a second execution omits to recite the issue of the first (HEitchinson v. Branlu, sp. t., 6 How. 73;* McMicl7aeZ v. Knapo, 7 Cow. 413); or if some persons are included in the writ who ought not to be (Van Deusen v. Brower, 6 Cow. 50); the execution may be amended so as to correct the error.,An execution may be amended after a sale has been made under it (Suydam v. McCoon, Colem. & 0. Cas. 64; 3 Johns. Gas. 421), or the defendant arrested under it (see Holmes v. Williams, 3 Cai. 98), or it has been returned satisfied. (Phelps v. Ball, 1 Johns. Cas. 31.),Ak. omission to file a transcript of the judgment of a local court (e.g., the Common Pleas) in another county, before levying upon property therein under an execution out of that court, may be obviated iune pro tunw at any time by the court.

SuBn. 1.-General princziles. The court may, before or after judgment, in further- ance of justice, amend any pleading by adding. or striking out the name of a party; or by correcting a mistake in such name, or in any other respect; or by inserting material'allegations; or, when the amendment does not substantially change the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading to the facts proved. (Code, 173.),* Affirmed without discussing this point, 9 N. Y. [5 Seld.] 208.
Amendment of pleadings. Inconsistent amendments. Statute of limitations.]-It is no objection to an amend- ment, not actually adding a new cause of action, that it will deprive the defendant of the defense of the statute of limitations. (Deane v. O'Brien, .sp. t., 13 Abb. 11.) But a distinct cause of action, barred by the statute, ought not to be admitted by amendment. (Sheldo7n v. Adams, 27 How. 179; see Jackson v. Murray, 1 Cow. 156.),Inconsistent ame)lndments.]-In equity, a sworn pleading was not permitted to be amended, except by adding mat- ter not inconsistent with the original pleading, or matter explaining or correcting it. (Verplankc v. Mercantile Ins. Co., 1 Edw. Ch. R. 46.) Under the Code, such an amend- ment may be allowed, upon a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances, such as to relieve the party from all suspicion of falsehood in his pleading. (See F1ielden v. Caselli, 16 Abb. 289.),A plaintiff will not be allowed to amend by adding a new cause of action inconsistent with the one on record. (Sheldon v. Adams, 27 How. 179.),Leave to amend a sworn complaint may be granted, although the amendments contradict the statements of the complaint, where it appears that the error arose by an excusable mistake, caused by similarity of different names. (Hall v. Fisher, 3 Barb. Ch. B. 637.),An amended answer may deny allegations of the com- plaint which were not denied by the original answer. A tacit admission is not to be construed as an express admis- sion, for the purpose of determining upon the consistency of the amended and original pleadings. (Fielden v. Caselli, 16 Abb. 289.) Nor is it improper for an amended answer to deny positively allegations which the original denied only upon belief. (Shanek7s v. Rae, 19 How. 540.),Amendment making pleading bad.]-The court will not grant an amendment which will render the pleading demurrable (Curtiss v. Leavitt, 11 Paige, 386), as for example, adding to a complaint a cause of action which 1044
Amendment of pleadings. Parties. could not properly be joined with the one already pleaded (BoHqfan v. Hoffmnan, sp. t., N. Y. Trans., June 20,1864); nor if the amended pleading can not be sustained. (MACl- loiugh v. Colby, 5 Bosw. 477; 4 id. 603; Dodd v. Astor, 2 Barb. Oh. R. 395 ; Lord v. Underdunck, 1 Sands. Oh. 46.) So an amendment to a complaint, adding a new count upon the same cause of action, will not be allowed. (Shieldo)t v. Adams, 27 How. 179; Nash v. M'Cauley, sp. t., 9 Abb. 159.),Verification.]--Where a pleading which the statute requires to be verified is served without a verification, the pleader may have leave to amend by adding it (Bragg v. Bickford, sp. t., 4 How. 21), even after judgment. (Joones v. U. S. Slate Co., sp. t., 16 How. 129.),Leave to amend the verification of a pleading was given on a motion against the pleading. (Davis v. Potter, sp. t., 4 How. 155.) Parties.]-The court may, before or after judgment, allow the name of a party to be added or stricken out, or a mistake in such name to be corrected. (Code, Â§ 173.),The court may allow an amendment at the trial, or .before, by adding (Dutcher v. Slack, sp. t., 3 How. 322; 1 Code Rep. 113), or striking out a party (Turner v. Hiller- line, sp. t., 14 How. 231), or substituting a receiver for a corporation which had been dissolved, the receiver having in fact defended the suit. (Fuller v. Webster Fire Insur- ance Conmwany, sp. t., 12 How. 293.) Where an infant brings an action in his own name, without a guardian, the court may allow an appointment to be made ngne pro tuic. (See Willis v. (iulerhill, sp. t., 6 How. 396; Forrest v. Forrest, 3 Code Rep. 254.*) *These were cases of married women suing without a next friend. There is no such requirement now, but these cases are fully applicable to the doctrine of the text.,1045
Amendment of pleadings. Parties. In a cause involving the validity of several legacies for pioris uses, it appearing that there was no trustee before the court who could claim the disposition of 'one of the legacies, the court gave leave to amend the bill, so as to make the attorney-general a party. (Andrews v. General Thieological Seminary, 8 N. Y. [4 Seld.] 559, note.),In an action against three defendants, for a wrong, one of the defendants died pending the action, and a discon- tinuance was entered as against another. Judgment for the plaintiff having been given, it was amended so as to stand against the remaining defendant alone. (Sherman v. Fream, sp. t., 8 Abb. 33.),One of the plaintiffs, after the commencement of the suit, being discharged under the two-third act, as an in- solvent, and another of the plaintiffs appointed his as. signee, leave was given to the other plaintiffs to strike out the name of the insolvent, and to amend the declara- tion so as to show the assignment. (Davis v. Schermner- 7orn, sp. t., 5 How. 440.),An amendment which involves an entire change of parties, plaintiff and defendant, will not be allowed, (Wright v. Storms, sp. t., 3 Code Rep. 138.) * The Code does not authorize the court to change the parties, by substituting as plaintiff a party who has a cause of action, in place of a party who never had any. (Davis v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 14 N. Y. 506, 526; see Van Duzer v. Howe, 21 N. Y. 539.),Leave will not be granted to amend a complaint by introducing new defendants, and also a new cause of action, if the new defendants were not affected by the original cause of action. (Peck v. Ward, 3 Duer, 647.),The complaint cannot regularly be amended as to par- ties, without a corresponding amendment of the summons.,* Reversing S. C., 2 Duer, G63; 3 id. 119.,_
Amendment of pleadings. Before trial. (Follower v. Laughlin, 12 Abb. 105; .Elmore v. iallette, sp. t., 16 id. 249; VCrane v. Zfoulton, 3 Sands. 736; Russell v. Spear, sp. t., 5 How. 142.) In Elmore v. allette (supra), it was doubted whether a defendant was bound to answer a complaint amended as to parties, so long as the sum- mons remained unaltered. But of this we have no doubt. The amended complaint is not void, but simply irregular, and liable to be set aside on motion, as incon- sistent with the summons. (See Follower v. Laughlin, supra.),Mistnomer.]-If a mistake has been made in the name of the plaintiff, e. g., in suing in the name of the trustees of a corporation, instead of in the corporate name (Trus- tees of Baptist Society v. Robinson, 21 N. Y. 234; Barnes v. Perine, sp. t., 9 Barb. 202), or in the name of a corpo- ration, when the plaintiff is really an individual banker (Bank of Havana v. Magee, 20 N. Y. 355), or where a public officer sues simply by his official description, instead of in his individual name, adding his name of office (Ageit of State Prison v. Ri7kenan, 1 Den. 279); or where the defendant is named by a wrong christian name (Hart v. Reynolds, 3 Cow. 32 n.), the error may be amended at any time, even after judgment. (Hart.v. * Reynolds, 3 Cow. 32 n.; see Trustees of Bap. So. v. Rob- inson, supra.*) A mistake as to the name or description of the defend- ant, such as suing A., as executor of B., when he is really executor of 0., and the demand is against the estate of 0., is amendable. (McElwaini v. Corning, 12 Abb. 16.),SUBD. 2.-Before trial. Either party should be allowed to shape his own plead- ings to suit himself; and for that purpose should be per- + *In that case it does not appear by the report whether the amendment had actually been made below, or not. But in point of fact it had not. The Court of Appeals disregarded the error, as being still amendable.,1047
Amendment of pleadings. Amending demand of relief mitted, at any time before trial, to amend his pleadings, so as to present his own views of the questions to be liti gated, and upon equitable terms. There is now no restriction upon the power of the court to allow such amendments, even though the effect be to change entirely the whole cause of action or the grounds of defense. It is only when a, party seeks to amend his pleadings after trial that the court is prohibited from allowing an amend. ment which would substantially change the claim or defense. (Troy & Boston R. R. v. Tibbiits, sp. t., 11 How. 168; Daguerre v. Orser, sp. t., 3 Abb. 86; see Beardsley v. Stover, sp. t., 7 id. 294.) And although there has been a trial, yet when that trial has been set aside, and a new trial rendered, the court has the same power to allow amendments to the pleadings, as though the action had never been tried. (Troy & Boston R. B. v. Tibbits, supra.),CChanging ground of action.]-In an action for an escape, the court refused, after answer, to allow an amendment, so as to charge defendant upon his liability as bail. (Da- guerre v. Orser, sp. t., 3 Abb. 86.),A plaintiff who purposely commences his action upon contract, with a view to obtain an order for publication and an attachment, should not be allowed to amend the summons and complaint, so as to found the action, not upon contract, but upon tort. (Lane v. Beam, 19 Barb. 51; 1 Abb. 65.),Amending demand of relief.]-In an action founded on defendant's detaining personal property of the plaintiff, the complaint demanded judgment for the value thereof only, but the parties having treated the action as an action for the recovery of possession, the plaintiff was allowed to amend his complaint accordingly, so as to sustain pro- ceedings of claim and delivery taken therein by him. (Dows v. Green, sp. t., 3 How. 377.) 1048
Amendment of pleadings. Unconscionable defenses. The demand for an injunction may be changed to a demand for damages, on dissolving the temporary in- junction. (Vincent v. King, sp. t., 13 How. 224.),In an action on contract, for the recovery of money only, the plaintiff may be permitted to amend, by in- creasing the amount claimed in the complaint, even after a reply, repeating the original claim, and where both pleadings were verified, a reasonable excuse being shown. (Merchtat v. New York Ins. Co., 2 Sands. 669.) Amenlding answer..]-The defendant was permitted to amend an ambiguous allegation in his answer, which might be construed as an important admission, on affi- davits denying that such admission was intended or was true. (Â¥anderbilt v. Accessory Transit Co., sp. t., 9 How. 352.) Even after the cause has been referred, the defendant may be allowed to amend by setting up a counterclaim. (Beardsley v. Stover, sp. t., 7 How. 294.),Unconscionable defenses.]-It was a settled rule under the old practice, that though where an inequitable defense, e. g., usury, was interposed, but in a manner adjudged defective, leave to amend should be granted, so as to pre- sent the intended defense; yet if the defendant, in the first instance, presented only another defense, he should not be afterwards allowed, by favor of the court, to set up such inequitable defense additionally. (Ct. of Errors, Beach v. Fulton Bank, 3 Wend. 573.),The rule as to a defense founded on the statute of limitations was the same. (Wolcott v. McFarlan, 6 Hill, 227; Jackson v. aric7;, 2 Wend. 294; Hallagan v. Golden, 1 Wend. 302; Coit v. Skinner, 7 Cow. 401.) The same rules in regard to unconscionable defenses are still applied under the Code. (Morris v. Slatery, sp. t., 6 Abb. 74; Bates v. Voorhies, sp. t., 7 How. 234; see Mao- quen v. Babcock, 13 Abb. 268; 22 How. 229; but compare,132,1049
Amendment of pleadings. At the trial. Brown v. Mitchell, sp. t;, 2 Abb. 481; 12 How. 308; Grant v.,M'Caughin, sp. t., 4 How. 216.),Where, however, the refusal of leave to set up an un. conscionable claim or defense would not deprive the party of its benefit, but merely put him to the useless expenseof a new suit, without any benefit to the other party, the amendment may properly be allowed. (Hartson v..Daven. port, 2 Barb. Oh. R. 77.),Sunn. 3.-At the trial. Amendments are very liberally allowed, at the trial, to conform the pleadings to the evidence. (Dauchey v. yler, sp. t., i5 How. 399.),The court has power to permit the answer to be amended upon the trial by setting up a new and distinct defense. (Fan Ness v. Bush; 14 Abb. 33; 22 How. 481; overruling Fagen v. Davison, 2 Duer, 153; Hunt v. Hud- son River Fire Ins. Co., id. 481; and see N.' Y. Marbled Iron Works v. Smithl, 4 id. 362; Grosvenor v. Atlantic Fire Ins. Co;, 1 Bosw. 469.) But an amendment substan- tially changing the claim or defense cannot be allowed at the trial, after evidence has been given. (Code, Â§ 173, as construed in Fagen v. Davison, and other cases supra.),Thus, in an action for false imprisonment, the plaintiff having rested his case, and failed to sustain his action in its original form, the complaint cannot be amended by adding a count for malicious prosecution. (Waldheimv. Sichel, 1 Hilt. 45.) And a complaint founded upon tort cannot under such circumstances be changed into one on contract. (Whitconb v. HJungerford, N. Y. Trans., June 24, 1864; see Walter v. Bennett, 16 N. Y. 250; Ransor V. Wetmore, 39 Barb. 104.),A complaint substantially alleging fraud may be amended at the trial, if necessary, by inserting a formal charge of fraud.. (Sharp v. Mayor &c. of N. Y., 40 Barb. 256, 270; 25 How. 389; see Neivstadt v. Adams, 5 DUer, 43.) So a formal allegation of gross negligence (New
*Amendtment of pleadings. At the triaL After verdict. sUit v. Adcnms, 5 Duer, 43), or allegations of special damage (Miller v. Garling, sp. t., 12 Htow. 203), or cir- cumstances of aggravation in assault and battery (Hagins v. De Hart, sp. t., 12 How. 322), or in an action for slan- der; the allegation that the words were spoken in the presence or hearing of some person (Wood .v. Gikhrist, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 117), may be added at the trial. If, on the trial, the plaintiff proves a good cause of action, which he intended to set forth in his complaint, the latter should be amended, if necessary, so as to con- form to the proof, even though, by reason of the omission of some material allegations, it would have been bad on demurrer. (JLounsbury v. Purdy, 18 ~ . . 515; see W7Mite v. Spencer, 14 id. 247.) Striking out an adm7ission.]-Leave to amend a sworn pleading on the trial, by striking out an admission, should not be granted, unless there is satisfactory evidence that the party has been deceived or misled, or that his plead- ing was put in under a mistake of facts. (Miller v. Moore, 1 E. D. Smith, 739; 12 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 53.),Variances.]-Material variances, which the party shows to have misled him, may be cured by amendment by the court, at the trial, on such terms as may be just. (Code, 169.) Immaterial variances may be immediately amended by the court, without costs. (Code, Â§ 170.) In an answer setting up usury, a variance from the proofs, in respect to the amount of usury, constitutes a proper case for amendment (Fay v. Grimsteed, 10 Barb. 321), and if it does not mislead, such variance must be disregarded. (Catlin v. Gctnter, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 368.) No difference can be made between the defense of usury and any others in this respect. (lb.) . As to disregarding variances, see post, art. 13.,1051
Amendment of pleadings. After verdict or decision.,SUBD. 4.-After verdict or decision. After demurrer.]-After decision of a demurrer, either at a special or general term, if it was interposed in good faith, the court may allow the party to plead over, upon such terms as may be just. If the demurrer is allowed for misjoinder of actions, the court may order the action to be divided into several. (Code, Â§ 172.),On sustaining a demurrer to an answer, leave to amend was refused, there being no objection to the manner or form of the pleading, but the matter being bad in sub- stance, and incapable of being made good by amendment. (Brown v. Tracy, sp. t., 9 How. 93.),Where the entire claim was deemed unconscionable, leave to amend after a demurrer had been allowed, was refused. (Yoorhies v. Voorhies, sp. t., 24 Barb. 150.) But the soundness of this decision may well be doubted. See ante, p. 1049.),After frivolous pleading.]- On granting a motion for judgment on an answer as frivolous, it has been held that leave to amend should not be given; though it is proper to grant the order without prejudice to defend- ant's right to offer an amended answer; and if it is refused by plaintiff, then to move the court for leave to serve the proposed answer. (Marquisee v. Brighamt, sp. t, 12 How. 399.),After trial qplon facts.]-Under a complaint for slander setting forth English words, the plaintiff proved the utter ance of German words of the same meaning. The judge allowed the plaintiff to proceed with the trial, and to apply after verdict for leave to amend. On such appli- cation, there being no pretense of surprise on the part of defendant, the amendment was allowed, but on condition that the verdict should be reduced to an amount which the judge deemed not excessive. (Lettman v. Ritz, 3 Sands. 794; see Debaix v. Lehind, sp. t., Code Rep. S. S. 235.),After referees have reported as to the amount due in 1052
Amendment of pleadings. After verdict. After judgment. foreclosure, the plaintiff should not be allowed to amend his complaint by inserting new allegations which the defendant would have a right to answer, e. g., to set up a judgment lien. (Field v. Hazwxhlrst, sp. t., 9 How. 75.),In an action against two on a joint and several note, judgment was entered against one defendant, under a stipulation that tile liability of the other should be deter- mined on the trial. After verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the latter, his application for leave to amend, by pleading the judgment against his co-defendant as a bar, was denied. (Hooughton v. Skinner, 5 Iow. 420.) After verdict, or the report of a referee, the demand of relief in the complaint may be amended by increasing the amount, upon terms. (Corning v. Corningt, Code Rep. N. S. 351; 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 97; Davis v. Smith, 14 How. 1S7; Bowican v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691.) Leave to reply.]-Whrere a complaint and answer formed an issue which did not present the merits, and the plain- tiff's attorney omitted to reply, through mistake, he was allowed to reply on terms, after tle cause had been heard before a referee. (Merritt v. Slocums, sp. t., 3 How. 309; Willis v. Underhill, sp. t., 6 id. 396; see Smith v. Floyd, 18 Barb. 522.),SUIvD. 5.--After jttlgment. Chanlge of catse of actioln.]-WhVere, in an action upon several demands, the referee found for the plaintiff, on the ground of a compromise between the parties fixing the sum due, and tlhe judgment was reversed, on the ground that the plaintiff should have been nonsuited for variance, it was held that tile court might, on terms, allow an amendment of the complaint, so as to bIse the action on the compromise. (Prindle v. Aldrich, sp. t., 13 How. 466.) An application after judgment for the defendant, for leave to amend the complaint, was refused as being too late, where the defendant's principal witness was dead,,1053
Amendmcnt of pleadings. On appeaL and the proposed amendment changed the whole founda- tion of the action. (Egert v. WicJer, sp. t., 10 How. 193.),Amendment o, appeaal.]-Where an amendment is re- quired only to conform the pleadings to the facts found, and the record furnishes the only ground for and against the amendment, such amendment may be ordered by the geheral term, on appeal fiom the judgment (Clarik v. Dales, 20 Barb. 42, 67; Hunter v. Hudson Riv. Mlacline Co., 20 Barb. 493; Harrower v. Heath, 19 id. 331), or the court will treat the pleadings as having been amended so as to conform to the facts proved, in any respect in which the court ought to allow an amendment upon application at special term (Sharp v. JMayor &c. of N. Y., 40 Barb. Abb. 431), and so will the Court of Appeals. (Lounsburyv. 25G; 25 How. 389; BoWdoin v. Coleman, 6 Duer, 183; 3 Purdy, 18 N. Y. 515; E:tirnett v. J.udsonl, 21 id. 238; Car- dell v. MeNeil, id. 336; and see ante, p. 931.),Where, in :n action on a lease, the instrument was set forth, and all the facts were put in issue, an error in the complaint in describing the claim as rent, when in reality it was founded on a covenant to be answerable for loss of rent, was held amendable. (Hall v. Gould, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.] 127.),In an action against the assignee in a fraudulent trans- ser of property by a deceased person, joining, as defend- ant with the assignee, the administrator of his assignor, and seeking to have the transfer set aside, an omission in the complaint to show that the administrator claimed to regard the transfer as bona fide, the administrator's answer averring that fact, may be at any time cured by amend- ment. (Bate v. Graham, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 237.),Demand for relief.]-In an action for chattels, the de- fendant's answer claimed, not a return of the property, but damages for the taking of it by the plaintiff in thP suit. On the trial, the complaint was dismissed, and 1054
Amendment of pleadings. After judgment. Delay. the court directed a judgment in favor of the defendant for the return of the property itself. On motioi to vacate the judgment for irregularity, the defendant was allowed to amend his ftnswer, so as to conform to the iudgment. (Martin v. Lott, sp. t., 4 Abb. 365.) Amletndmtent to be allowed only to sustain, judgment.]- Amendments after judgment can only be made for the purpose of sustaining the judgment. (Englis v. Furniss, 3 Abb. 82; see Brown v. Colie, 1 E. D. Smith, 265; Gasper v. Adams, 24 Barb. 287.) In general, a party who has not applied for an amend- ment till he has been nonsuited, cannot be relieved; but an amendment and a new trial were granted, under pecu- liar circumstances, notwithstanding this rule. (Balcom v. Woodruff, 7 Barb. 13; disapproved in Englis v. Furniss, 3 Abb. 82.),Usury.]-It is not in furtherance of justice to allow the defendant, after judgment against him on a defense of usury, to amend so as to avoid a variance, and grant him a new trial, except on condition of his consenting to judgment for the amount admitted to be due, with interest and costs. (Gasper v. Adams, 24 Barb. 287.) Delay.]-Tho motion should be made promptly after judgment. Eight months' delay was held an almost con- clusive objection. (Saltus v. Genin, sp. t., 3 Bosw. 639; 8 Abb. 253.*) Leave to amend an answer, after judgment for the plaintiff had been affirmed on appeal, was refused, as too late, although the order of affirmance reserved leave to defendant to apply for such leave. (Malcom v. Baker, sp. t., 8 How. 301.) This, however, seems hard. *Approved, on dismissing an appeal from this decision (S. C., 10 Abb. 478).,1055
Amendment of judgments. Rehearing.,APiT. 5.-An)ie(nidment of juldgmenlts. In a recent case (N. Y. Ice Co. v. Northw estern Ins. Co,, 23 K. Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296), the court of last resort asserted the power of every court of record to amend its judgments to any extent in furtherance of jus- tice, so long at least as the time for appealing from themn has not expired, if not afterwards.,We apprehend that there is no foundation for any dis- tinction in regard to the lapse of the time to appeal, which indeed was only suggested by the court out of abundant caution. The true rule seems to be that no amendment should be made to a judgment inune pro tune, without imposing such terms as will enable the adverse party to appeal from it as amended.,The practice of granting a rehearing, which prevailed in equity, is no longer in existence in this state; and there- fore many amendments, which, under the former practice, were allowed only upon 'a rehearing, must now be granted on a mere motion, or not at all. It was clearly not the intention of the legislature, in framing the Code, to limit the power of the courts to grant amendments in further- ance of justice, and hence we infer that whatever amend- ments might formerly have been made on a rehearing, and which cannot now be procured by an appeal from the judgment, can be granted on motion.,A mistake in the amount of the judgment (Hunt v. Grant, 19 Wend. 90; MIechanics' Bank v. Minlthorne, 19 Johns. 244; Price v. Evers, Cole. & C. Cas. 46), or in the name of the plaintiff (Marsh v. Berry, 7 Cow. 344) or defendant (Hart v. Reynolds, 3 Cow. 42 n.), or in omitting a finding upon one of the issues (Stakes v. Ca spuell, 7 Cow. 425), or in including costs where they were not really allowed (Murray v. Blatchford, 2 Wend. 221), or omitting them when they were allowed (O'Drisoll v. M'BBurney, 2 Nov. & M. 59), is amendable. 1056
Amendment of judgments. Amending judgment roll. _ .- Mere clerical errors (Marsh v. Berrmy 7 Cow. 344; see Clark v. Hall, 7 Paige, 382), or miscalculations (Mechan7lics' BanlD v. Minthorne, 19 Johns. 244; see Rogers v. Hosack, 18 Wend. 319), were always corrected, and clauses neces- sary to carry out the judgment supplied (Spraglce v. Jones, 9 Paige, 395; People v. M'Donald, 1 Cow. 189), even under the old practice.,Under the Code, a judgment may be amended on motion, by striking out parties from the record (Sherman v. Fream, sp. t., 8 Abb. 33); by altering an erroneous direc- tion for further proceedings, so as to conform to the sta- tute (Alvord v. Black, sp. t., 5 Abb. 451); by adding to a judgment of dismissal leave to serve a new complaint in the same action, and proceed de novo (N. Y. Ice Co. v. Northwestern Ins. Co., 23 N.Y. 357; 12 Abb. 414; 21 How. 296); or by modifying a judgment of reversal, by directing anew trial, instead of judgment absolute for the appel- lants. (Meyer v. City of Loluisville, 26 Barb. 609; 7 Abb. 6.) No amendment can be allowed for the purpose of making valid a judgment absolutely void. (Kendall v. Was7hburn, sp. t., 14 How. 380; lIallett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 43.),lAmending judgment roll.]-The court will allow amend- ments to the judgment roll to any reasonable extent. The only restrictionssupon such amendments are that they must always be in furtherance of substantial justice, and are never allowed for the purpose of sustaining a mere technicality of any kind (see Gasper v. Adams, 24 Barb. 288), and that they must tend to sustain the judgment. (Ib.; E nglis v. Furniss, 3 Abb. 82.) If any papers, therefore, have been omitted from the roll, the court may and will allow them to be inserted in it nunc pro ttne. (Crog7han v. Livingston, 17 N. Y. 218; 6 Abb. 350; Waring v. Waring, sp. t., 7 Abb. 472; Farmers' Loan and DTrust Co. v. Dickson, sp. t., 9 Abb. 61; 17 How. 477; Jones v. U. S. Slate Co., sp. t., 16 How. 129; Holmles,133,1057

Thatcher, sp. t., 5 How. 226), may be entered on the roll, lnun pro twue.,A separate cause of action, abandoned on the trial, may be withdrawn from the record after judgment. (Fry v. Bennett, sp. t., 9 Abb. 45.),The proceedings in an action commenced by service by publication, up to the point when the service is complete by publication and by mailing, cannot be amended. After service is complete, the court can amend whatever is irregular, but cannot amend any of the proceedings tend. ing to confer jurisdiction. (Hallett v. Righters, sp. t., 13 How. 43; Kendall v. Was7bu1rn, sp. t., 14 id. 380.),Signature of clerkI.]-The clerk's omission to sign a judgment, filed and docketed, is considered a mere clerical error, and may be supplied nune pro tune at any time (Van Alstyne v. Cook, 25 N. Y. 489; Seaman v. Drake, 1 Cai. 9; Williams v. Wheeler, sp. t., 1 Barb. 48.),By whom granted.]-No alteration can be made ina judgment by a judge out of court, even though he ren- dered the decision himself. (Hoyt v. Car.ter, sp. t., 7 How. 140.) The application must always be made to the court (lb.),But, if possible, such applications must be made to tho justice who tried the cause (see Hotaling v. Marsh, 14 1058
Amendment of judgments. Of miscellaneous proceedings. Abb. 161), especially in the first district, where a judge out of court has the same powers as if he were in court. The propriety of such a course is so obvious as to need no argument. An amendment of the judgment of a general term, not affecting the merits, may be made. by a special term of the same court. (Bagley v. Browln, 3 E. D. Smith, 66; see De Agreda v. Mantel, sp. t., 1 Abb. 130.) | Mode of amentdment.]-A judgment should never be altered by obliteration or erasure, even if the passage erased remains legible. (Sluyter v. Smith, 2 Bosw. 673.) The order of amendment should be inserted in the judgment roll, and the amendment entered in the judg- ment book; or the judgment, as amended, entered in full, with a reference on the margin of the original judgment to the place where such new entry is made. (lb.),ART. 6.-Amcendlment of miscellaneotus proceedings. Afidavits.]--In a very unfortunate and ill-considered decision, BRONsoN, J., held that an affidavit was not amendable. (ClicJlnman v. Clickma7l, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 611; 3 How. 365.) But the authority of that decision has been very justly questioned (Bowman v. Sheldon, 5 Sands. 657); and in numerous cases, both before and since the Code, affidavits have been amended. (Furman v. Walter, sp. t., 13 How. 348; Hees v. Snell, sp. t., 8 id. 185 n.; Spalding v. Spalding, sp. t., 3 id. 297; Cutler v. iath- bone, 1 Hill, 204; Dexter v. Hoover, 2 Cow. 526; Doe v. Roe, 1 Chit. Rep. 228; see Ten l7ick v. Simplson, 11 Paige, 177.) Thus, where an affidavit did not contain the jurat or signature of the officer before whom it was sworn, leave was granted to swear to the affidavit anew, and the party charged with costs. (Hees v. Snell, sp. t., 8 How. 185 n.) And on an application for a second examination in supple- mentary proceedings, the omission to state the fact of the,1059

Demarest, sp. t., 2 Hilt. 543.),Attac7nment.]-The omission of the attorney for the plaintiff to sign a warrant of attachment, may be sup. plied by amendment mune pro tane. (Kissam v. Marsalil, sp. t., 10 Abb. 424; Genin v. Tomp~kins, 12 Barb. 265.),Bills of particllars.J-The court allowed the plaintiff to amend his bill of particulars, by adding new items, after the cause was at issue, and three times noticed (Fuller v. Roosevelt, 4 Cow. 144), and after a new trial had been granted on the merits, and the cause had been twice noticed therefor. (Splawn v. Yecder, 4 Cow. 503.),Bolnds.]-Whenever a bond required by law is defective, the court, officer or body who would be authorized to receive it, or entertain proceedings in consequence of it, may, on application of all the obligors, amend the same in any respect; such bond to be thereupon valid from the time of its execution. (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 870; [2 id. 556].),Under this provision, the court may allow an appeal bond to be amended by adding another surety, where there are less than the required number. (Potter v. Balker, 4 Paige, 290; see Shaw v. Lawrence, sp. t., 14 How. 94.),The application should be made by all the obligors in the bond. Their petition should specify the alterations, and expressly consent thereto, and agree to execute and acknowledge the amended bond. Otherwise the amends ment might be ordered and made, and then, by their refusal to execute the bond as amended, the alteration would have released them from the old bond, while no other one would be substituted. (Shaw v. .Lawrena, supra.) The amendment should be with the written consent of the obligor, to be annexed to and filed with the bond. (Potter v. Baker, 4 Paige, 290.),The bond of a guardian ad litem may be amended after judgment and sale in foreclosure. (Waring v. 1060
Amendment of miscellaneous proceedings. Cases and exceptions. Waring, sp. t., 7 Abb. 472; see Crog7ha v. Livingston, 17 N. Y. 218; 6 Abb. 350.),Case and xcelptions.]-A case may be amended by in- serting matters omitted by mistake of counsel (Foot v. Colvin, 2 Johns. 481), or prevented, by accident, from coming within the time stipulated for settlement to the bands of the counsel employed to attend to settling the case. (Hun v. Bowne, 1 Cai. 23.) The Supreme Court having affirmed a judgment ren- dered upon trial by the court, on the ground that certain facts were established by the evidence, though not stated in the finding, the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals. In that court the cause was ordered to stand over, with leave to the appellant to apply to the court below for a resettlement of the facts found, which were not sufficiently stated; and the application was accord- ingly made at a general term. It was there held, that though the general term could not resettle the facts found below, nor send the cause below for a resettle- ment; it would permit a statement of the findings of the court at general term to be settled, and attached to the record, on terms. (Smith v. Grant, 17 How. 381.) Though in general the Court of Errors would not, after argument and decision, give leave to amend the case submitted, they did so where the main question was yet undecided, and the form of the record, without amend- ment, excluded that question. (Ct. of Errors, Powell v. Waters, 8 Cow. 755.) The Court of Appeals, on motion to dismiss an appeal, has frequently allowed a case to be amended. (Laheits v. Fielden, 15 Abb. 177; Westcott v. Thompson, 16 N. Y. 613; Magie v. Baker, 14 id. 435; See 'Exceptions, below.) Whea certain questions of law were distinctly pre sented by exceptions taken at the trial, and were decided by the court below, in rendering the judgment appealed from; if the bill of exceptions does not sufficiently pre-,loCi
Amendment of miscellaneous proceedings. Commissions. sent those questions, the appellant ought to have leave to apply to the court below for leave to have the bill of exceptions resettled, so as to present them; and the resettled bill should be filed, when returned to the Court of Appeals, as of the original date. (Ct. of Appeals, Iiingston v. SMiller, 7 How. 219.) But after argument and judgment, the Court of Appeals will not set aside the judgment and stay proceedings, to enable the appel. lant to make such an application. (Ct. of Appeals, Fitch v. Livingston, 7 How. 410.),An amendment to a bill of exceptions was allowed, where a new trial had been denied on the ground that the true state of the cause could not be ascertained from the bill as submitted. (Lynes v. Noble, sp. t., 1 How. 226.),Conmmissions.]-A commission wrongly stated the names of several witnesses; but the witnesses intended were ex- amined, and the commission returned with their true names; and on motion the commission was amended by inserting the true names, and it was sent back to have the witnesses re-examined, instead of issuing a new com- mission. (Keeler v. Yanderpool, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 289.),Injunction.]-A plaintiff may, in a suitable case, have the form of the injunction order modified, so as better to protect his rights (Williams v. Johnson, 2 Bosw. 1); but not if the injunction ought not to have been granted at all. (Miner v. Webb, sp. t., 10 Abb. 284.),Interrogatories.]-Leave was allowed to amend inter- rogatories put to the sheriff on an attachment; the amendment not relating to any new matter, but only to explain an ambiguity, so as to obtain a more full answer to matters already stated. (Herring v. Tylee, 1 Johns. Cas. 31.) And leave was granted to amend by inserting an interrogatory inadvertently omitted. (People v. Browl, 6 Cowy. 41.) 1062
Amendment of miscellaneous proceedings. Notices. Notices.]-A notice of appeal may be amended by sup- plying any defect, unless so gross that the court could not be satisfied that the notice was intended for an appeal in the action. (See Sherman v. Wells, 14 How. 522; Jackson v. Fassitt, 33 Barb. 645; 12 Abb. 281; 21 How. 279; Ten EiclC v. Simlson, 11 Paige, 177.) Thus a notice of appeal from a justice's court may be amended by inserting a specification of grounds of appeal. (Irwin v. Mutir, sp. t., 4 Abb. 133; 13 How. 409.) But where a notice of appeal has been given, in all respects perfect in itself, and only notifying an appeal from a judgment, the court cannot allow an amendment so as to make the appeal an appeal from an order denying a new trial, after the time for appealing from such order has elapsed. (Fry v. Bemnett, 7 Abb. 352; affirming S. C., 16 How. 385.) An amendment of formal defects in a notice of appeal was refused, on the ground that a new appeal could be taken equally well. (Tet E.lick v. Simpson, 11 Paige, 177.) Orders.]-An order granting "costs" of motion, may be amended by inserting the amount. (Tillspalugl v. Dicc, sp. t., 8 How. 33.) An order setting aside a judgment as irregularly en- tered, was amended by inserting leave to apply to the court below for judgment anew. (Hoi7kinis v. Flynn, 7 Cow. 526.) Petitions.]-Omissions in the body of a petition (Rogers v. McLean, 11 Abb. 440),* or in its verification (ib.), or authentication (ib.); or the entire omission of a verifica- tion (Van Wyck v. Hardy, 11 Abb. 473; 20 How. 222), may be supplied, even after judgment. Returns.]-The return of any officer, court or tribunal may be amended, in form, by the court to which the,* Reversing S. 0., 10 Abb. 306; 31 Barb. 304.

Rogers, 5 Johns. 163.),Where the sheriff omitted to indorse the proper return on the execution, the writ was upheld by allowing the return to be indorsed nunc pro tune. (Hall v. Ayer, sp. t, 9 Abb. 220; 19 How. 91.),Where the word " copy," and the signature of the clerk, were omitted from the return on appeal, the appellate court refused to dismiss the appeal on that ground, but allowed an amendment. (Flarmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Carroll, 2 N. Y. [2 Comst.] 566.),After a lapse of five years the court refused to order a former sheriff to amend his return to a writ, by stating the commitment of the defendant, who had broken out of prison with many others, leaving the plaintiff to his action for false return. (Potter v. Briggs, 1 Cai. 57.),Shlerif's certificates awl deedls.]-The sheriff may be required to amend his certificate, by adding a parcel in the description of tlhe lands sold (Sm)ith v. Hudson, 1 Cow. 430); or by striking out a parcel which should not be sold, the defendant consenting, and no injuries to third parties being possible (Richards v. Varintln, sp. t., 8 How. 79), or by inserting a reference to the proper execution. (Ganse. voort v. Gilliland, 1 Cow. 218.),A formal variance between the judgment and execu- tion, and the recital in the sheriff's deed, is amendable, and may be disregarded. (Mattteis v. Cook, 13 Wend. 29.),UTdlertak7tngs.]-An undertaking may be amended by striking out all reference to one of two appeals (Scher merhorn v. Anderson, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 430); or by increasing the amount of security (Kissain v. M.lfrshall, sp. t., 10 Abb. 424; Sterntiaus v. ScJhmidt, sp. t., 5 id. 66); or supplying the want of an acknowledgment (Conklin V. Dutcher, 5 How. 386), or the approaal of a justice. (Beah 1064
Amendment of miscellaneous proceedings. Verdicts. v. Southlworth, 6 Barb. 173.) A defective undertaking may be amended, on motion to discharge from arrest. (See Bellinger v. Gardner, sp. t., 2 Abb. 441; 12 How. 381.) It has been held that an undertaking on alppeal cannot be amended in respect of any defect not occurring by mistake. (N. Y. Central Ins. Co. v. National Prot'n Ins. o., sp. t., 10 How. 344, citing Clode, Â§ 327.) In other cases, tle defect may be excused on any other grounds. If the justification in an undertaking is technically insufficient, leave should be given to amend. (People v. Ta)bdlc, sp. t., 17 How. 120; Ten Eick v. Simpson, 11 Paige, 177.),An undertalding cannot be amended, in any material respect, without the consent of the sureties (Langley v. Warner, 1 N. Y. [1 Coinst.] 606; 3 How. 363; 1 Code Rep. 111), and this, it seems, should be in writing. (Wilson v. Allen, 3 IHow. 369; see Bonds, supra.),Yerdicts.]-Formal defects in ' verdict may be amended. If it is sufficient in substance, the court may put it in appropriate words. (Burhans v. Tibbits, sp. t., 7 Iow. 21.) Thus, where the court instructed tlie jury to find for the defendant on the first issue, and left the second to them, and they returned a verdict for the plaintiff on that, witllout .oticing the first, the verdict was amended by adding a finding thereon for the defendant. (Ib.) So where the record showed a general finding for the plain- tiff, without noticing an issue on the statute of limita, tions; and the bill of exceptions showed that tlhe jury did in fact dispose of that issue, the omission is amend- able, and should be disregarded. (Read v, Hurd, 7 Wend. 408.) Where a verdict is given for defendant, contrary to the directions of the court, if full justice can be done by changing the verdict, so as to conform to the directions, the court will permit the defendant to consent to such amendment. (See ClOark v. Riclhards, 3 E. D. Smith, 89.),134,1065
Amenclnrant of miscellaneous proceedings. Verdicts. If, in an action for chattels, the jury award no damages for the detention, upon finding for the plaintiff, the ver- dict may be amended, on his motion, by inserting nomi- nal damages. (Van Schoening v. Buchanan, 14 Abb. 185, 468.),The court will not attempt to modify a verdict, unless it can see the items themselves which entered into the verdict. (Hunt v. Hobocen L.and Co., 3 E. D. Smith, 144.),When one count is good, and the other bad, if the judge certifies that the whole of the evidence applied solely to the good count, or would properly apply to it, as well as the others, a general verdict may be amended. (Allen v. Addington, 12 Wend. 215; Sayre v. Jewett, id. 135; Stafford v. Green, 1 Johns. 505; Union Turnpike Co. v. Jenkins, 1 Cai. 381; see Benms v. Beek7can, 3 Wend. 667.) Where it appears that the evidence could only apply to a bad count (Postley v. Mott, 3 Den. 353), or that the recovery was based partly on the bad count, amendment cannot be allowed. (Van Rensselaer v. Platner, 2 Johns. Cas. 17.) Where it appears from the judge's certificate, that the evidence did not particularly apply to the bad count, the verdict may be amended on payment of costs, (Stafford v. Green, 1 Johns. 505.) Verdict on one issue only, but comprising the merits of all, may be amended to cover all the issues. (Ct. of Errors, Rocl7feller v. Don- nelly, 8 Cow. 623.),Where the verdict is defective in substance, e. g., where, in replevin, thejury found, on the several issues presented, that the defendant did take, &c., and that the property was not in those in whom his plea alleged it to be, but did not find that it was in the plaintiff,-the court cannot amend it by adding nominal damages. (Ct. of Errors, Bentus v. Beeknman, 3 Wend. 667; reversing S. 0., 7 Cow. 30.),A special verdict agreed on by the parties, without trial, cannot be amended by the court on a conflict of affidavits, 1066
Amendment. Allowing an act to be done as of a prior day. but the court may vacate it, on terms. (Jackson v. Cannon, 2 Cow. 615.) An amendment of a verdict, so as to apply it to a good count, can only be made by the court in which the trial was had; and after that court has refused leave so to amend a verdict, and judgment has been rendered on the verdict, the appellate court cannot order the record to be amended. (Cooper v. Bissell, 15 Johns. 318.) But where, upon appeal to the general term of the same court in which the cause was tried, it appears that some of the counts in the complaint are defective, but others are good, and it further appears, from the printed case, that all the evidence given was applicable to the good counts, an amendment of the record applying the verdict to the good counts, is proper. (Snell v. Snell, 3 Abb. 426.) The court has no power, under the pretence of amending or correcting a verdict, to alter it in any respect contrary to the actual intention of the jury, however perverse that may be (U. . S. Trust Co. v. Harris, 2 Bosw. 75), or though it is the result of misdirection by the judge. (Brush v. Kohn, sp. t., 14 Abb. 51.) Such errors can be corrected only by motion for a new trial. ART. 7.-Allowuing a act to be done as of a prior day. The court in which an action is pending has a general power to allow any act, necessary to be done in the course of the cause, to be done after the time at which it should regularly have been done, with the same effect as if it had been done at the proper time. The only exceptions to this rule are the service of a notice of appeal (Salls v. Butler, 27 How. 133), and the entry of an order permitting an appeal to the Court of Appeals in an action tried in a justice's court (Wait v. Van Allen, 22 N. Y. 319); which acts cannot be done after the time fixed by the Code. The court has power to grant leave to file and serve exceptions nuna pro tuiw, after the time fixed by the aodo,1067
Allowing act nunc pro tunc. The motion and order and rules of court has expired. (Peck v. N. Y. & Liverpool Steamship Co., 3 Bosw. 622; Bortle v. Mellen, sp. t., 14 Abb. 228; Sheldon v. Wood, sp. t., 14 How. 18.) In an action for partition of lands, the guardian ad litem of an infant defendant may be allowed to execute and file the bond required by 2 It. 8., 317, Â§ 4, inle pro tunc, after sale. (Croghan v. Livingston, 17 N. Y. 218; 6 Abb. 330; affirming S. C., 25 Barb. 336.) So an undertaking upon appeal (Mills v. Thursby, No. 8, sp. t., 11 How. 129), a sheriff's return (Hall v. Ayer, sp. t., 9 Abb. 220; 19 How. 91; Bradford v. Read, 2 Sands. Ch. 163), an execution which has been lost (Bradford v.

(Van Alstyne v. Cool2, 25 N. Y. 489.),The court has not power to order judgment nune pro tune, as of a date prior to the actual judgment, to enable a party to tax his costs under an old fee bill. (Moore v. Westervelt, 14 How. 279.),ART. 8.-The motion and order. The motion for leave to amend must be made in the court in which the action is pending (ante, p. 1037); and to the court, not to a judge out of court.,Excuse tmust be show.n.]--While the court should grant an amendment whenever it can see that justice would be furthered thereby, upon terms just to the opposite party, it is in all eases proper to require, from the party asking the amendment, some reasonable excuse for the defect which he seeks to correct. (Ilarrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 161.),An application for leave to amend, by alleging matter of which the plaintff (Whitmarsh v. Campbell, 2 Paige 1068
The motion and order. Denial of truth of aniendnment. 67; Fermilyea v. Odell, 4 id. 121), or any one of several plaintiffs (Thorn v. Germanld, 4 Johns. Oh. 363), was aware when he commenced the suit, must be denied, if no excuse is shown for the omission. On applying for leave to set up a new defense, the defendant must satisfy the court that he was not aware of the facts at the time of pleading, and must excuse his laches, if any. (Cocis v. RBadford, sp. t., 13 Abb. 207; see ante, p. 170.) It is of course a good excuse that the error was caused by the misrepresentations of tle adverse party. (Britt v. Van) OGden, 1 Johns. Cas. 390; Colem. & 0. Cas. 99.) Sulbmittinig am nmendmenlts.]-It is not always necessary that the matter of proposed amendments should be sub- mitted to the court on the application. But the court will not allow the plaintiff to strike out any part of a sworn complaint without a previous specification of the points intended to be omitted. (Reunwvick v. Wilson, 6 Johns. Ch. 81.) Who may oppose.]-B3ail have no right to object to an amendment of proceedings in the action. (Coster v. Phoe- nix, 7 Cow. 524; Blue v. Stout, 3 Cow. 354.) j Denial of truth of amerldment.]-On application for leave to amend a complaint, the defendant's denial, by affidavit, of the truth of the amendments, has been held of no importance (Coster v. Griswold, 4 Edw. Ch. 364, 377); but an amendment of an answer will not be allowed, if clearly shown to be false. (Morell v. Garelly, 16 Abb. 269.) The reason of the distinction between the two cases is, that the court has no power to strike out a com- plaint as false, while it has such power as to an answer; and it is guided by analogy from these rules in dealing with amendments.,Merits of amendmlent.]-The court will not look into the merits of a proposed amendment, any further than to,1069
The motion and order. Terms of amendment. see that it is not palpably frivolous. (Turner v. Deter, 4 Cow. 555; see ante, p. 170.),Leave to amend not an approval of amendment.]-Leave granted to put in an amended pleading is not to be taken as sanctioning the form of the new pleading, but it remain open to any legal objections. (Ward v. Barber, 1 E. D. Smith, 423.),T7Le order.]-The order should, as a general rule, state in what respects the party may amend. But it seldom contains all the details of the amendment, if any there are. Thus an order giving leave to add parties should usually give their names, or describe them, if their names are not known, and should state whether they are to be plaintiffs or defendants. So an order allowing a pleading to be amended should specify the nature of the changes allowed, as, where a new claim is to be added, by stating what it is founded upon, and its amount; but it need not give the very words which are to be introduced, unless the party obtaining it chooses to insert such a statement,It should prescribe the proper terms of amendment, as to which see the next article. No terms are implied from an order simply granting leave to amend. (Barstow v. Randall, 5 Hill, 556.),ART. 9.-Terms of amendment. Wheen no terms need be imposed.]-An error which could not have prejudiced the adverse party, may be amended without imposing any terms whatever. (Cayuga Countl Bank v. Warden, 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 19; Yanderpool v. Tar box, sp. t., 7 N. Y. Leg. Obs. 150; see BankT of Havana v. Magee, 20 N. Y. 355.) And even a prejudicial error,if amended before the adverse party has incurred any expense or inconvenience in consequence thereof, may be amended without imposing terms. 1070
Terms of amendment. Costs. WIhen terns must be imposedl.]-In other cases, amend- ments should be granted on terms which will indemnify the adverse party for all the expense to which he will be put thereby (Union Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267), that is, for the taxable costs and disbursements for proceedings which will be made useless by the amend- ment (see Hare v. White, sp. t., 3 How. 296), and which will protect him from any injustice in other respects.,Costs.]-Thus, on allowing an entire change in the cause of action, all the taxable costs up to the time of amending, and also costs of motion, should be allowed to the defendant. (Prindle v. Aldrich, sp. t., 13 How. 466; Troy & Boston R. R. v. Tibbitts, sp. t., 11 id. 168; Downer v. Thompson, 6 Hill, 377; Carrier v. Dillaye, sp. t., 3 How. 173; see Lyon v. Blossom, 4 Duer, 318, 331.) On allow- ing a new cause of action to be added to a complaint, after trial, the defendant should be allowed a trial fee, and his disbursements, and leave to answer anew. (Uinion Bauic v. fMott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267.) On allowing the plaintiff to strike out the name of a defendant who proves not to be a proper party, the terms should be such as to indemnify the remaining defendants for the expense to which they will be subjected by the amendment. (Tur- ner v. Hillerline, sp. t., 14 How. 231.) On allowing such an amendment at the trial, the plaintiff was required to pay or secure, forthwith, the costs of the defendant whose name was stricken out, and to allow the trial to stand over, if the other defendant desired it. (Bemis v. Bronson, sp. t., 1 Code Rep. 27.) On allowing a plaintiff to amend, or file a supplemental complaint, bringing in necessary parties, where he had, after knowledge that such parties were necessary, proceeded to a judgment, and had liti- gated an appeal, the court imposed terms of payment of all costs since the time when the plaintiffs were first informed of the facts, which made the bringing in of other parties necessary. (Sage v. Mosher, sp. t., 17 How. 367.) Where,,1071

Mayor &c. of New Toork, S). t., 19 How. 144,),But paynlent of an extra allowance should not be required as a condition of amendment (Troy & Boston B. R. v. Tibbits, sp. t., 11 How. 168), nor can the payment of any disbursements not allowed by law be required, (Hare v. White, sp. t., 3 How. 2!)9; 1 Code Rep. 70.1,After an action for trespass has been brought, iolnded on an irregularity in an execution, leave to amend the execution was conditioned on payment of costs of the action, as well as of the motion. (Porter v. Goodmlan, 1 Cow. 413.),Where the plaintiff had been allowed to amend his complaint without costs, and afterwards, on argument, the answer was held bad, the court allowed the defend. ant to amend without costs. (Ifoxie v. Ctush7maln s. t., N. Y. Leg. Ohs. 149.),bcelinquishisint g verdict, &'c.]-In an action for unliqui. dated damages, upon a wrong, where the verdict exceeds the amount claimed in the complaint, an amendmlent of the complaint so as to increase the demand of danages cannot be allowed, except upon terms of relinquishing the verdict, payment of costs, and consenting to a new trial. (Corning v. Cornjing, Code Rep. NT. S. 351; approved, S. C., 6 N. Y. [2 Seld.] 97.) And the same rule lhis been applied to an action for services, in which a refere awarded an amount to the plaintiff exceeding that de manded by the complaint. (Bowmallni v. Earle, 3 Duer, 691.) But in an action on contract, where every, iltlu hb been contested, and the defendant in no way misled, the plaintiff may amend his complaint in regard to the claim of damages, and retain a verdict or judgment for an 1072

Where, after trial before a referee, lave is given to adda new cause of action, the plaintiff should be required, if the defendant desires it, to consent that the report be set aside, and the order of reference vacated, with costs to abide the event. (Allaben v. VWakeenan, 10 Abb. 162.) Where, after issue joined on demurrer, the plaintiff pro- ceeded to trial, and had a verdict on the facts, and subsequently judgment was given against him on the demurrer, he was allowed to amend on relinquishing the verdict and paying costs of demurrer, and all costs subsequent to the issue. (Fidler v. Cooper, 19 Wend., 285.) Requiring evidence to stand.]-On allowing an amend- ment of the pleadings after trial, the court cannot, without the consent of the adverse party, direct the evidence taken on the trial to stand upon the new trial (Union Bank v.Molt, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267; see Bissell v. Ha,1?in, 13 Abb. 22); though it may doubtless require the consent of the amending party to such an arrangement, as a condition of allowing the amendment. Leare to plead.]-On amending a pleading, in substance, the adverse party must be allowed to answer the amended pleading (3 R. S. (5th ed.) 722; [2 id. 424]; Webb 4. Wilkie, 1 ai. 153; LUnion Bank v. Mott, 11 Abb. 42; 19 How. 267;* Allaben v. Wakeman, 10 Abb. 162.) But, although the order for amendment will be erroneous if it does not reserve this right to the adverse party (Union Bank v. Mott, supra), he cannot plead anew without leave. (Bar- stow v. Randall, 5 Hill, 556.),ART. 10.-Mode of amendmlent. Plcadings.]-It is the usual and better practice to pre- pare an entirely new copy of a pleading, as amended.,* Modifying S. C. at sp. t., 10 Abb. 372; 19 How. 114.,135,1073
Mode of amendment. Service of amended pleading. But this course is not absolutely the only one allowable An order embodying the amendment, and attached to the pleading, no doubt operates as an amendment.,It is not indispensable that an amended pleading should be so designated upon its face (Hurley v. Second Building Asso., sp. t., 15 Abb. 206); but it is a convenient and con. mendable practice to do so.,Service of amended plleading.]-On amending a pleading in any respect, a copy of it, as amended, and of the order allowing it, must be served on the adverse party (Akin v. Albany Northern B. R., sp. t., 14 How; 337; see Allaen v. Wakeman, 10 Abb. 162); and this although judgment has been had against him by default. (People ex rel. RBurn sey v. Woods, 2 Sands. 652.),An amendment of the complaint, where there are two defendants, is an amendment as to both, though they have severed in their defenses; and both must be served with the amended pleading. (Thomas v. Allen, 2 Wend. 618.),Other papers.]-The rules herein stated concerning pleadings are applicable to nearly every paper which is served upon an adverse party. A copy of the amend. ment, and of the order authorizing it, should always be served.,Amendment of judgment ; judgment roll.]-A judgment record should not be amended by an obliteration or erasure, even when it leaves the passage legible. The amendment should be made by appending the order of amendment to the roll, as well as by entering it in the proper book, and by referring in the margin of the entr of the judgment to an amendment as made by an order of such a date. The portions changed or omitted, could be designated by brackets, underscoring or otherwise Or the judgment may be entered anew, as amended. (Sluyter v. Smnith, 2 Bosw. 673.) But amending by aa 1074
a de of amndmdment. Effect of amendments. erasure is not ground for vacating the amended judgment. (Ib.) A judgment should not be amended, by inserting a further consequential direction in the judgment itself. The amendment should be by an additional order, entered on the judgment roll. (Sprague v. Jones, 9 Paige, 395.) A manifest mistake in a judgment should be corrected on motion in like manner. (Lawrence v. Cornell, 4 Johns. Ch. 545.) But a mere clerical error, though in a sworn com- plaint, may be amended by interlineation. (Ayres v. Â¥alwn- tine, 2 Edw. Oh. 451.) And so a mistake as to the christian name of any person is a mere matter of form, and may be amended by inserting the name in the original decree. (De Caters v. De ChOaumont, 3 Paige, 178.) On amending the docket of a judgment, in the amount, the proper course is to file a copy of the order in each of the clerk's offices, and make a brief reference to it in the several dockets. (Hunt v. Grant, 19 Wend. 90.) Where, after judgment on verdict, the defendant's motion for a new trial was denied with costs, the court refused, on motion of the plaintiff, to amend the record by inserting these costs, but granted leave to take the record from the files, and cancel the docket, and file a new record for the full amount. (Shepard v. Hoit, 6 Hill, 395.) Entry nune pro tutc.]-On entering a judgment or order as of a prior day, the real time of its entry should be stated, as well as the day of its fictitious entry under the order granting leave to enter minic pro tunc. (Barclay v. Brown, 7 Paige, 245.),AIT. 11.-Effect of amendments. Of pleadings.]--An amended pleading is a substitute for the original, which is no longer to be treated as a plead- ing in the cause. (Kapp v. Barthan, 1 E. D. Smith, 622; BwrraU v. Moore, 5 Duer, 654; Kanouse v. Martin, 3,1075
Effect of amendments. Of execution. Sands. 593; Seneca Co. Bank v. Garlinghonse, sp. t., 4 How. 174; see Brovwn v. Saratoga B. R., 18 N. Y. 495,) But unless the order granting leave to amend reserves to the adverse party the right to plead anew, he cannot do so. (Barstow v. Randall, 5 Hill, 556.),Under an order granting aln amendment with a general leave to plead, the adverse party may demur upon a ground which was decided against him before, though the pleading is amended in a point which has no possible bearing upon the ground of demurrer. (Bosanquet v. Marsham, 4 Sim. 573.),An injunction does not drop on amending the con. plaint, although the order granting leave is silent on that subject. (Selden v. Vermilya, 4 Sands. lOh. 573; see Ftr. niss v. Brown, sp. t., 8 How. 59.) Nor is a deposition taken under the original pleadings rendered inadmissible' by an amendment which does not substantially change the issue between the parties. (Fincent v. Conklin, 1 E. D, Smith, 203.) Nor is a defendant deprived of the benefit of an offer to allow judgment, by an amendment of the complaint. (Kilts v. Seeber, sp. t., 10 How. 270.),An amendment of a pleading, setting up facts incon- sistent with the original, is not prina facie an admission that the original was willfully false. (_ElizabethTport lanl. facturing Co. v. Camnibell, sp. t., 13 Abb. 86.),As to parties.]-A party brought in by amendment, or by supplemental complaint, who ought to have been an original party, may set up any defense existing when he is brought in. (Campbell v. Bowne, 5 Paige, 34.),Of execution.]-Whvere, after levy, the execution'having been lost, the court had ordered a new one to be issued, and directed the sheriff to make upon it the same in- dorsement which was upon the first, it was held that such new execution and indorsement was a substitute for the other, and admissible in evidence without proof of 1076
Disregarding errors. Variances. loss of the original. (Burkle v. Luce, 1 N. Y. [1 Comst.] 163.),ART. 12.-Disregarding errors. The court must, in every stage of the action, disregard any error or defect which does not affect a substantial right of the adverse party. (Code, Â§ 176.) An error which cannot mislead the adverse party, and which does not put him to any inconvenience, or compel him to do any act which he would not have done, if such error had not occurred, is plainly within this provision. Thus, the omission of a mere formality, which may be supplied inne pro tune at any time, such as the clerk's signature to a judgment roll (Van Alstyte v. Coolk, 25 N. Y. 489), or the entry of an order upon the remittitur from the Court of Appeals, making the judgment of that court the judgment of the court below (Chlautaiuqua Co. Bank v. White, 23 N. Y. 347), may be disregarded.,AnT. 13.-- ariances. lmmtaterial variances.]-Immaterial variances between the pleadings and proofs are to be disregarded. (Code, 170.) And no variance is deemed material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice upon the merits (Code, Â§ 169); nor unless that fact is proved at the trial, to the satisfaction of the court. (Id.; Catlin v. Grunter, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 368; Zabriscie v. Smith, 13 id. [3 Kern.] 322; Chaipman v. Carolin, 3 Bosw. 456.) Thus, a variance from the precise terms of a contract as pleaded (Catlin v. Gunter, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 368; Craig v. Ward, 36 Barb. 377; Cobb v. West, 4 Duer, 38), or from the time at which a transaction was stated to have occurred (Dubois v. Beaver, 25 N. Y. 123; aff'g Relyea v. Beaver, 34 Barb. 547; Potter v. Tliompson, 22 Barb. 87; IHovey v. Amier. Mit. Ins. Co. 2 Duer, 554; Beach v. Tooker, 10 How. 297), or as to the place of its occurrence (Newstadt v. Adamis, 5 Duer, 43); or as to the,1077

Didier, 4 Duer, 448); an averment of an agreement absolute, and proof of an agreement with a condition that was fulfilled (Hart v. Hudson, 6 Duer, 294); an averment that the defendant had not delivered certain stock, and proof that he had tendered it, but that the plaintiff had lawfully refused to receive it, its value having been diminished by the defendant's fraud (Seaman'v. Low, 4 Bosw. 337); an averment of notice, and proof of facts excusing notice (Purchase v Mattison, 6 Duer, 587); an averment of a sale, and proof of a contract to manufacture goods (Union India Rubber Co. v.

'(Richards v. Westcott, 2 Bosw. 589); an averment that a certain act was done by or to a party, and proof that it was done by or to his agent (Bennett v. .Judson, 21 N. Y. 238; Rogers v. Verona, 1 Bosw. 417); an averment that goods belonged to the plaintiff, and proof that they were consigned to him for sale (Gorurn v.

Co. 18 Barb. 69, 79); an averment that waste was wrongfully committed, and proof of negligence merely (Robinson v. Wheeler, 25 N. Y. 252); and a description of land as bounded on the east by land of A., and proof that it was so bounded on the west (Russell v. Conn, 20 N. Y. 81); are all immaterial variances, in the absence of posi- tive proof that they have misled.* A complaint alleging fraud may be sustained by proof of other facts substantially pleaded in it, without proof of fraud. (Byxbie v. Wood, 24 N. Y. 607; Swintfeln v. Clielms- ford, 5 Hurlst.-& N. 890, 920; Kay v. Smith, 7 H. of L. Cas. 770.) Material variances.]-Variances which have misled may nevertheless be amended on terms. (Ante, ). 1051.) Failure of proof.]-Where a cause of action or defense is unproved, not merely in some particulars, but in its entire scope and meaning, this is not a case of variance merely, but of entire failure of proof. (Code, Â§ 171.) Thus, a plea of want of consideration cannot be sus- tained by proof of payment (Texier v. Gouin, 5 Duer, 389; see M'Kyring v. Bull, 16 N. Y. 297); nor an aver- ment of payment of money,'by proof of a transfer of stock (Mann v. Morewiood, 5 Sands. 557);t nor an aver- ment of a guarantee, by proof of a mere indorsement of * For further illustrations of this principle, see .Poirier v. Fsher (8 Bosw. 258); Powler v. Atlantic Ins. Co. (id. 689); Rose v. Bell (38 Barb. 25); Jitbanlk v. Dennistoun (1 Bosw. 246); Peckham v. Leary (6 Duer, 494); Willis v. Orser (id. 322); Hawins v. Appleby (2 Sands. 421). t It may be doubted whether this was anything more than a variance, amendable on terms.,1079
Variances. Failure of proof. a note (Cottrell v. Conklin, 4 Duer, 45); nor a claim upon a note actually made by three defendants, by proof of a liability of two of them upon an entirely different note (Lawrence v. McCready, 6 Bosw. 329); nor a claim for damages caused by turning water upon land, by proof of an interference with the drainage of such land, which prevented the water naturally there, from flowing off (Pixley v. Clarkl, 32 Barb. 268); nor can a complaint, founded wholly upon a tort, be sustained by proof of a claim arising purely upon contract. (Walter v. Bennett, 16 N. Y. 250; Moore v. McKibbin, 33 Barb. 246.) And a plea of license will not admit proof of title in the defend. ant. (Coan v. Osgood, 15 Barb. 583.),It has also been held that an averment that an agent falsely pretended to purchase and sell stocks for his prin. cipal, and charged him with a fictitious deficiency, could not be sustained by proof of an actual purchase by the agent, and conversion to his own use (Saltus v. Genin, 3 Bosw. 250; 7 Abb. 193); and there are some dicta to the effect that a complaint alleging a contract as a common carrier cannot be sustained by proof of a contract as for- warder (Hempstead v. N. Y. Central B. B., 28 Barb. 485); and that an averment of neglect on the part of a railroad corporation to establish cattle guards will not allow of proof of neglect to build fences (Parker v. Rensselaer Saratoga R. R., 16 Barb. 315); but we greatly doubt the soundness of these propositions. In Deifendorff v. Gage (7 Barb. 18), it seems to have been held that under an allegation that a thing was of very little value, proof that it was of no value was inadmissible, but this is obviously untenable. In Whittaker v. Merrill (30 Barb. 389), it was held that a complaint by an assignee, charging a conver- sion of certain property since it was assigned to him, could not be sustained by proof of a conversion thereof before its assignment to him, and of an assignment of the claim arising thereon to him. This decision is, how- ever, open to much doubt. 1080
